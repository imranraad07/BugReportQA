so give me the option to _tell_ the compiler which one to use or which one to ignore  the rest of the world is fine using the first one on the command line  but i can understand why that won't work for rust after seeing the makefiles  if you actually think two third party  rlib s with the same hash and version are not equally valid  and it can break something to link to the "wrong one"  that makes me question the point of having versions and hashes 
i don't know  i thought that since it's doing it for  then maybe it wants to do it for other cases too  but devs didn't get around to doing it  yet  but  now considering how many cases it doesn't detect  compared to like only 1 that it does  maybe this one is just simply a side effect of something and thus  it wasn't intended to detect things like this for other most cases  however the main reason for detecting such cases  i'd think  is for optimizing code  other reason is for warning you when you do obvious dead code mistakes eg   for i in 1  1  when you meant  for i in 1   1   ok  bad example   even other reason s  is issue https   github com rust lang rust issues 57553 where if the loop was detected to happen only once  a completely different  real true  error would be shown  instead of the fake one where rust assumes a value moved which would only happen in loops that iterrate more than one time  i'm not sure i understand  what do you mean here  it's  expected  to      do nothing  to  not  warn as dead code  how does  for _ in 1  0  go  through a _ton_ of library code    rust library  other people's library  sorry  i'm not understanding    upon further reflection  i believe you're right  i'm closing this 
starting with firefox 52  currently on alpha aurora dev edition  we're using rust code for official builds on all of gecko's tier 1 platforms  including arm android  i also hope to require rust by default for individual developer builds in the next few weeks  i'm unclear how serious #37630 is  i can actually build firefox for android with 1 13 0  but haven't run tests  i figured it if was important enough to mention in the release notes  we should probably avoid it for firefox nightly   brson we in fact plan to move firefox nightly to the 1 14 beta to test the std debuginfo with our crash reporting  but that is riskier  and as alex mentioned  the fix isn't available in 1 14 beta yet  so i asked for this in parallel as a safer fallback  requiring a beta is also extra hassle for every gecko developer doing their own build targeting arm

right  well  yeah  i could add the      operation if that seems like the right way to do it  resources seem like a solution  but the question is where the resource goes     take a look at the "built in destructors" extension proposal in my original post 
 djrollins note that i only _think_ that this should be an easy task  i don't have enough experience with the compiler to _know_ that it's easy     theoretically you should only need to find where the compiler is printing that specific error message  then add a "note" when the type mentioned in the error message implements any of  fn    fnmut   or  fnonce   you can look at many other error messages to see examples of "notes" being generated  figuring out whether or not the type implements any of the fn traits is probably going to be the trickiest part  because i'm not sure whether we have a convenient api to determine that for an arbitrary type  as a start you could merely implement the note _only_ for bare functions  the  fn    types  since they're always callable  though i'm not sure if it's _actually_ any easier to distinguish  fn  from normal types compared to just looking up whether a type implements any of the callable traits  for any compiler hacking  i'd recommend joining the #rust internals irc channel and casting around in there as you think of questions  that's also probably the best place to find a mentor  good luck    
  would it be complicated if  code x  code  is passed across abstraction boundaries    would it be much harder to locate where the exact problem source is  in this case the semicolons inside the braces of the  code let x  code  statement  if  code x  code  is later used in many other  code let  code s and expressions inside an abstraction boundary    what if the previous two cases mixing together  i think semicolons in the expression syntax should be forbidden  maybe in the phase of semantics analysis  since  code let x   nil  code  doesn't seem useful from my perspective  and it may confuse some not that experienced programmers  such kind of easy typos may also fail an integrated compilation and test quickly which i think is not that good since it will possibly make everyone jittery

i was trying to leverage the type system so that reader tasks could only read state and writer tasks could only write state  it's probably not that big of a deal though and the code is simpler with an enum like the above 
perhaps saying that the  i32  is the expected type because the loop is the implicit return  i forgot about  break value   actually being a thing when i initially posted the issue  though  for  loops also have the issue  i guess the issue might actually be that we're not showing where the i32 came from

thanks for your follow up questions  this issue https   github com jeffmurray must issues 1 has a link to a bug i tracked down  it was difficult to find because the runtime reports "rust  task failed at 'connection closed'   home jeff rust 0 7 src libstd option rs 307"  rather than the line of call that issued recv   on the closed connection  another example  although more complicated  is current issue i am facing  https   github com jeffmurray must blob cbb0c9d7e0cb6e46a35772ac567b4b680ba3f5ef src must_bank rs#l331 it is "fixed"  usually  by placing a bunch of yields   before my tear down call  i think i have a handle on the problem with my code  but fixing these things are hit and miss because the line containing the recv   that causes it is not reported 
raw strings with quotes have to be bounded with  #   like  r#""hello""#   this isn't immediately obvious  especially for someone coming from  say  python  an example showing this usage explicitly or a link to raw string documentation would be nice  on monday  september 8  2014  steve klabnik notifications github com wrote 
the compiler doesn't fail  the problem is that the code it generates seems to be wrong  with an older version of the compiler from just before the llvm upgrade  or with optimization off  or with the most recent change i made to rust crypto   the  make check  works  without those things   make check  runs  but some of the tests fail 
i don't think the user will understand  this  in  type x this   to be a "local type parameter"  i didn't  if that's just the issue  it could call it something else 
hmmm  i pretty sure i put a comment here  and now its gone  strange  anyway  here it goes again  alphabetical order    random order  that's great when you know what you are looking for and just want to find it  when coming to a new non trivial code base  being presented the content in random order is just about the worst possible way to access it  nested modules allow us to group related modules together  and that's a good thing  if you have a long list of modules  certainly  group them  but this doesn't solve the problem  you now have a toc where each level is randomized  which is still inaccessible  searching for a function or module by name is an important use case  sure  but being able to access a new code base is as important  if not more so  looking up a name in a short non alphabetized list  at each level  isn't too hard  and one can always compensate for the lack of an alphabetical index by using  f  trying to understand a system presented in random order is next to impossible  and one can not compensate for the lack of a comprehensible order in a large system  if there was a way to specify the order of the entries in each level  which we agree should only contain "a few" entries  then the toc would become accessible  if one could even add a bit of annotation for each level  so much the better  the annotated toc would serve as a very accessible way for a newcomer to understand the code base  and  this doesn't rule out also generating an alphabetically sorted reference index  beside the toc  all good books do both   a toc in reasonable order and an index for looking up data by name  we shouldn't have to choose  we should be able to get both  so  i misnamed the issue  it should be "rustdoc shouldn't list modules _only_ alphabetically" 
because it prints a warning or an error  not a note 
i'm not sure  there are a few options  1  use the local name 2  use the local name  and put a  note   on the renaming import 3  use the unqualified original name 4  use the full path i think  1  and  3  are too ambiguous  my preference is  2   but something like this is still unacceptable   if two distinct types would have the same unqualified name in a given error message  at least one of them must be printed qualified  actually  do we want this to hold over the entirety of type errors printed by rustc in a given run 
there is  rustdoc  http   doc rust lang org std index html#macros  for the macros in std  plus some of the built in syntax extensions  it's not that easy to find  there used to be a  std  macros  module in the rustdoc output but no longer    i'm not sure exactly what should be documented where  the built in syntax extensions like  conact   might deserve special mention  as they give you capabilities within  macro_rules   that you otherwise would not have  cc  steveklabnik

right now it is impossible to run the rust nightly package at all  since it can't find its own libraries  this gives me no opportunity to pass any flags  the documented way to use rustc right now is "put ld_library_path in the environment"   cmr the user should never have to specify whether they want rpaths or not  there is a simple rule  if the libraries are in the standard path  never use rpath  if they are not in the standard path  always use an absolute rpath to it  relative rpaths are useful in other languages during  make test   but that is the domain of cargo  which i think has it under control   thestinger i might be wrong about   etc ld so conf d   but that is what i've observed 
that really would be librlibc  it only seems to happen under some very specific conditions
with that i get "unknown error  os error 8  not enough storage is available to process this command  "

traced it all the way down to somewhere between  nightly 2017 10 09  and  nightly 2017 10 10  but i don't have time to dig further  note that the llvm error  only  appears when compiling core using the dev profile so this is not going to affect most users which will be compiling core in release mode  xargo always compiles core in release mode  and that works     or should work once #45836 is fixed

 drop  is already a lang item  calling  drop  drop  explicitly is disallowed  for safety reasons   so it’s already special  we might want to change the behaviour of using  drop  as a bound in the future  so disallowing it for now would make that a backwards compatible change   drop  as a bound is basically useless because it doesn’t mean that the type has no destructor  it just means that it doesn’t explicitly implement  drop   e g    struct foo typethatimplsdrop    does not impl  drop   but still uses  typethatimplsdrop ’s  drop  impl as part of its destructor    drop  is barely a normal trait at all  it has a method  but that method can’t ever be called explicitly  i think that  drop  being a trait is merely a convenience that stops us from having to add a special way of adding destructors to things  it certainly should never be used as a bound

that's irrelevant 
linux supports at least 4k and 8k pages and x86_64 supports at least 4k and 2m pages  but linux on x86_64 will be using 4k pages  it's not clear which limit this refers to

yes  i'm okay with it  though i think the compiler could be able to infer the trait that is needed to implement  if there are multiple traits in submodules implementing the method it could ask for an explicit import  and if an inferred trait would implement functions already implemented it could also say that a possible implementation is found but would lead to an ambiguity 
never mind  i misunderstood the cause of the segfault  it was not related to i32    u8    char at all  since char can contain a positive u8  i was thinking like a c++ programmer  my apologies 
i'd be happy to make a pr  though i probably won't get to it until tomorrow 
this was fixed by #18160 
well  yeah    i've found a way to borrow the box but it's extremely ugly  prepare yourself     no  honestly  this can't be it  i'd rather hit myself with an axe  there are a few rfcs out there which seem to address this problem  but i'm not sure whether they address mutable references as well  maybe you could  have a look  https   gist github com nick29581 809614adb2bbb38232b7   i'm not even sure if these rfcs are related to this problem 
 christopherdumas hmm  i just omitted the main function  the error is just what you said  it can't find foo 
as far as i've understood it  rustc invokes  cc   ld   which are part of gcc  to create the final binary or cdylib  that's also why it only fails with test and not with build  as build for a lib crate afaik doesn't need to use a linker 
the most conservative lint formation i could see is if the impl block defines the exact same names but in a different order  then warn  i'd want to see a crater run with that lint on to see how false positive it is  but if you pick the same names and choose a different order  it certainly seems like a bug waiting 
 punitkoura that’s wonderful  ❤️ i don’t think there’s any rush  it was mostly a minor annoyance i had when maintaining the playground 
should these functions be associated functions like  box  into_raw   the  box  case is required because we want to avoid colliding with methods exposed by  deref     derefmut   this isn't a concern for  string  or  vec t    but it may be nice to be consistent across this family of similar functions 
i wonder why that type can be cloned in the first place   
yeah  that'd be fair 
 const  could be a modifier for any type  making the modified type usable in constants const fn beyond "just assigning values of it to variables and fields"  otherwise i don't see how we could ever call  bar 's field i don't understand this statement  can you elaborate 
maybe without any descriptive word   is there any particular reason we're displaying the note at all  in the examples i was able to coax out of the compiler the main message was the part that was helpful  the note was just redundant 
ah  i wasn't aware of the discussion in the forum  i'll move this to rfcs now  thanks 
i don't have time to make a minimal example  you can reproduce the bug with  cargo build  for the project https   github com ptal rust peg commit e0f3568d53833a193301e21296f7322075603e95 regex seems broken for now but you can just remove the dependency to term in the cargo toml  it'll stack overflow anyways 
the simplest possible repro i could think of  an empty  data  trait in another file  plus the above  doesn't seem to cause the ice  let me try ripping up the project it is exploding in until i get something with less code  unless the reason for the ice occurs to you  then i'll stop     
 sfackler we’re telling that some arbitrary hasher should be considered a main hasher  whatever main is supposed to mean here  for hashtables even while we reserve a capability to change  and likely will  eventually  default hasher for hashtables at will  especially see https   github com rust lang rust issues 29754 
i’m not sure  but i’m sure windows’ task manager has both ability to "kill" the process  equivalent of sigkill  and "terminate" the process  equivalent of sigterm  
the compiler requires user crates to increase the recursion limit manually  but unlike with rustdoc  you will only ever hit those cases in regular compilation when you actually use types in a certain way that would require such recursion   rustdoc  is significantly more prone to such recursion 
to the contents of the parentheses  i understood "because we arent returning anything" to point to dropping the declaration of the return type of the function after an arrow "  " 
possibly related   i ran with ' c llvm args  debug' and after several hours  received an indexing assertion

i always forget to test with nightly  confounded  so i guess this can be closed 
i initially would have said  no  they should not panic   len    says it has the same safety guarantees as  size_hint  and  size_hint  stresses that it's basically just for optimization and nothing bad should happen if the returned size is incorrect  but thinking about it again    maybe checking this might not actually incur any notable performance overhead and be useful  lets consider the implementation for  exactsize    the  none  case is a cold path  so the additional check there probably doesn't matter  the  checked_sub  in the  some  branch might be fine  too  well  this is certainly something we should benchmark and test before stabilization 
 phansch cool  you may well be right  judging by that  incidentally  i should have said the    error format  option is misleading  and not properly documented in the case of  x py      it seems to simply get ignored 
the issue can be seen without running  but i'll provide instructions for running at the bottom of this  i am trying to use rust to create a store app  when linking against import libraries for dlls  what's imported is just a  jmp  instruction followed by a couple  nop  instructions  the  jmp  jumps to an address stored in the contents of a memory location that is addressed by relative offset to an entry in the import address table  iat   for the above code  linked against the vccorlib import library for 64bit store applications  the  jmp  instruction for the platform  details  getcmdarguments function winds up with an absolute offset into the iat instead of a relative one  this causes at best an invalid access at runtime and worse jumping to a random point in memory and executing code  if the executable is patched to use a relative offset instead  then the program runs fine  to run the code  1  compile the above code for testing being sure to specify the path to the 64 bit store version of the visual studio 2013 vc libraries as a linker path  defaults to c  program files  x86  microsoft visual studio 12 0 vc lib store amd64    1  copy vccorlib120_app dll  msvcrp120_app dll  and msvcr120_app dll next to the test executable from c  program files windowsapps microsoft vclibs 120 00_12 0 21005 1_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe  the hash at the end might be different   if necessary use visual studio to create a run a sample 64bit windows store app to install those libraries  2  for each of the copied dlls run link exe  edit  appcontainer no  dll  3  run the executable
first of all  if the api is not mine  so i can hardly do anything for it  secondly  maybe  sfackler who is the author of the api in this example  the postgres crate   has something to say  but i think taking trait objects may be unavoidable in cases like heterogenous lists  so diagnostics in such cases are not a non issue  indeed  as you say  there's no way to convert     t   to     trait   without an allocation  i don't see that as an argument why a hint wouldn't be great to have here – precisely because the conversion can't be automatic in this case 
well it used to be that way  then  iirc  you moved the impls into  core  num  dec2flt   so it should just work 
here is the full offending code 
certainly  although it is not the best stacktrace i have ever seen 
 mati865 is there a guide i can use for this 
ha  good question  let me check  it used to work fine even with codegen units maybe a week ago

 steveklabnik i tried this on one of the latest nightly  can't remember exactly which  surely not older than a week though 
it's broken in nightly release  try the following code in  playground  https   play rust lang org   after choosing 'asm' and 'nightly' 
take code from  here  https   github com ababo arwen tmp  
 jonas schievink you beat me to it  i was just gonna confirm  grin 
with   c codegen units 1  the lto version is the fastest 
absolutely 
i haven't tried 1 2  sorry for the lack of context  i ran into this bug with some throw away code  i thought the stack would be enough      rodolfo on wed  jul 1  2015 at 10 38 am  arielb1 notifications github com wrote 
i think so  yeah
 arielb1 that somehow managed to lock up rustc  using 0  cpu  before getting to codegen  or even optimizations   fun 
honestly i got it from stackoverflow  http   www robvanderwoude com errorlevel php is another good one retep ninja'd me on my others 
yes  debian does split debuginfo  however we don't usually need buildsystem level support for that  we just use  dh_strip   which wraps around  strip 1    after the build  e g   here  https   sources debian net src llvm toolchain 3 9 1 3 9 1 9 debian rules #l447    i'm not sure what would be suitable for rust upstream 
 alexcrichton i think they could be merged with upstream  but i actually would prefer it to use the existing llvm installation instead of rebuilding llvm over and over again during the rustc build  why what do you need  filecheck  for  is it really needed   nagisa i have looked at the docs  but i am unable to compile rustc do to the error message i posted above 
ah it's a dupe of https   github com rust lang cargo pull 1969 anyhow
my platform   x86  linux  debian 8 
lol  lets not do  that   i think so  yes  be welcome to file a pr i guess   
ah  apparently i did  although i don't remember changing it  or why i would  reverting that back to the default fixes it for me  thanks 
the console is empty 
i've recompiled rust and the test program with the "e m e p 32 32 i64 64 v128 64 128 a 0 32 n32 s64" datalayout  unfortunately with the same result 
yes
edit  smaller repro
nah  it is fixed already  see #42080   and it is related to   http   doc rust lang org nightly std    http   docs rs   local crate documentation generated by nightly  crate doc  
nope  same error with  2016 11 22 
yeah  you solved my question  thanks 
sorry  i misrepresented the issue here  it's really got to do with conversion using  as _   i've updated the original post to reflect this 
this is quite inconvenient  as far as i see  there isn't any beta of  1 11  available on  static rust lang net  yet  without starting a big discussion   why isn't it possible to bootstrap rustc with the previous stable version 
is that request still applicable if i'm using rustup instead of multirust 
 clippy errors txt  https   github com rust lang rust files 452048 clippy errors txt  i've uploaded an example text file of errors  it seems that there are a few more errors reported now before it bails but i'm pretty sure it's not all the lints since the project was eol soon after i reported the issue 
i assumed you also had the span of the ast  item that was passed in  if that is not easily available then i'll close this 
as a motivating use case  existential types defined by a closure are required if we want to extend  lazy_static   to support referring to local variables

hmm that's a valid point  the main reason for putting linked in this ci was to find the prs that break links in the first place  if the timeout of cached links is set to  12 hours  and a build takes 4 hours  then we would reduce the chance of spurious failure by about 2 3  but would know within roughly 3 prs when the link broke 
well  since the "fix" module no longer makes rustc accept the program  this is definitely less confusing  i think the rule is that the type has to be defined in my crate as well  so  option t   is no good  but my  almost identical   field t   fits in this arrangement  this seems quite surprising when working with it  it means that it's impossible    to create a blanket impl when specializing for any built in type  even though this is one of the arguments for why the standard library would like this  i've thought a bit about it  and i think i've figured out why it's so confusing  intuitively  i know that  u32  does not implement  intoiterator   and in fact  i  cannot  impl that combination  because my crate contains neither type  so is this disallowed because this impl could potentially exist in the future  thanks for the feedback  i appreciate it 
yep  that should do it  my current nightly is at  rustc 1 18 0 nightly  252d3da8a 2017 04 22    and running  rustup run nightly cargo bench  throws that error  edit  some more details  1  i'm on a mac 2  i didn't need to change any code on my end to make this fail  it just started failing today after pulling in the updates on nightly 
hmm    that's a good point  the thing is i didn't change anything in the portfile  this is about the macports port of rust   anyway  here is the file you asked  https   gist github com g5pw ed53c82737bb0e124f40ea421c473c78
 nikomatsakis here's a smaller example   playground link  https   play rust lang org  version nightly mode debug edition 2015 gist 4babcdafdb3641e1527336f02d70fb2e     removing  adopt p  c    will make the program compile  but the error message doesn't mention that line at all  it's important to note that  even though in this example it's fairly obvious that  children  borrow  parents   in the original post it was not 
i'm not sure  it can be implemented by  elfmalloc  https   github com ezrosent allocators rs tree master elfmalloc   and elfmalloc uses a similar design to jemalloc  so my guess is that the answer is yes  but i'm not sure  i'm also not sure about libc malloc 
i can't unfortunately  but i believe you that it is fixed now  reproduces on my version with just a doc comment containing "        file  " 
 howaboutsynergy heh  looks like the same indeed  thanks  let's close as duplicate then
yeah  what  cryze said  this is not for importing foreign functions  this is for easily and safely exposing rust functions that allocate+return+deallocate  box  via c api 
ah  i see  thanks very much  closing since that seems appropriate  if anyone has any further comment feel free to add it  edit     the current nightly  2017 01 06  builds the test code linked above successfully    
 niconii  retep998 can it set the environment variables pointing to lib directory to compile the source file and link obj files with libraries on windows  it's like vc++ compiler linking the some " obj" files through environment variable "lib" that point out library directory 
it was there in  rustc 1 42 0 nightly  31dd4f4ac 2020 01 13    as that is what i was using initially  but i don't know when it appeared before that 
opened there  thanx

 steveklabnik ok  copied to https   internals rust lang org t how to copy code from librustdoc 5432
so here's the code to replicate the benchmarks
 simonsapin looking at  pftbest 's fix i guess my q is  why don't 16 bit targets  msp430 avr  need this macro at all 
yes  that worked  sorry for using this as a support forum  i was not aware of  cargo update   my bad  👍
something like "out of memory while    "  maybe "failed to allocate more pages"  etc  just segfaulting isn't actually informative  p
i’m using it as a deadline  and i want to make sure the struct doesn’t grow in the future  it’s big enough already  met vriendelijke groet  thomas de zeeuw https   thomasdezeeuw nl  https   thomasdezeeuw nl   thomasdezeeuw gmail com  mailto thomasdezeeuw gmail com 
 ixrec well  i would tend to agree with you but turning on optimisation pretty much prevents using a debugger which in embedded land is a major use case  what i'd love to see is finegrained control about optimisation of crates because usually one is not interested in debugging libcore on an embedded system while the opposite is true for own code  hal code and sometimes third party drivers 
oops  fixed  yes  removing unreachable_unchecked has no effect on the generated assembly

thanks 😊   i'm interested in submitting a pr  but i'm not going to have time to do so until the 27th  if no one else does it before me i'll submit one around then   i'm also planning to perform a similar analysis on mpsc shared sometime next month  benchmarking it will be a bit more complicated  but i suspect contention on its shared counter might be a scalability bottleneck  
here's a minimal subset of the actual code that shows the problem  fn listen  self  status  linktoport  link_from  linkfromport     result joinhandle      error    let join_handle     std  thread  spawn  move      loop   let packet   link_from recv     println  "  "  packet         ok join_handle   
yes  then here is a minimal example  https   github com valff hygiene_bug
 iliekturtles crater  cargobomb was the old name  tests multiple versions of some crates  but always the latest one  in the  uom  case  0 17 0 was the latest when the crater run started  one takes about 5 days to complete   and  it passed  https   cargobomb reports s3 amazonaws com beta 1 27 1 beta 2018 05 10 reg uom 0 17   you don't need to worry about that     
stable looks fine as well
none of these helped   i want to make warnings be warnings again when i call  cargo doc

i'm not entirely sure  i only started recently with hacking the compiler  i think this can be easily done by looking at https   github com rust lang rust blob 49d139c64b69ec5289f9f81db885ecfc2c7a8366 src libsyntax parse lexer mod rs#l947 l950 you could do something similar to this   of course you should also detect more than one  e g   return       also make sure it works for  let a   ""        
removing     xargo  has no effect 
 ollie27 the latest nightly errors  so i should probably change the title  you mean the correct behaviour is erroring  i did not realize this  it seems quite surprising to me that the crate itself compiles   cargo build   but then would not succeed in doc tests due to code that is not actually within a doctest

i think that normally the libs team is given a chance to comment on the issue  it's only been 3 hours   but the worst that can happen is that they reject your pr  all i can say for sure is that i will not be implementing this particular patch myself 
 jonas schievink producing a maximally portable binary  or even just as a "c parity" issue  we can already do all sorts of unsound things with the command line flags  this wouldn't be breaking new ground   hellow554 i'm lead to believe that the stack itself can be fragmented because of how rust llvm builds things  so it's not sane to make it simply "do nothing"  but i will experiment with such a brute force approach when i have time and report back 
you're right  i had initially found the  target cpu native  as odd as well but i had stopped worrying about it as it produced a perfectly functional executable on my target platform and generated no errors or warnings during the build process  and that was over 6 months ago  this doesn't look like a regression  in fact it is probably exactly the opposite  looks like some part of the build pipeline is  and has long been  smart enough to realize  target cpu native  resolves to something non arm and ignore it while printing a bunch of warnings like i only recently started seeing  i bet these warnings were silenced in previous versions and now they aren't silenced  and thanks to that  and you reminding me of it once again  i can now see that  target cpu native  was incorrect there  i have removed that bit and the issue is no longer present  thanks  rkruppe  note  although it is still odd that  target cpu native  means  skylake  on my kaby lake cpu    
it works fine on stable  edit  and the latest nightly works fine too  closing this then
 hellow554 i did think of using a plugin for myself  but in general websites use sans serif because it's more readable for more people in large blocks of text  so i'm sure i can't be the only one that has a problem with the font in the standard library docs  in that case i thought it would be best if the docs either changed to sans serif or at least provided an option to change for people who can't read serif fonts easily  like me   another minor reason for a font face change could also just be out of consistency  i don't keep up with the development of the rust language itself too closely  but from what i've seen people seem to value consistency here  so it's strikes me as odd that the docs and the books  which all get lumped together on the initial page after running  rustup doc   don't have consistent font faces  it's a bit jarring to jump between them so suddenly  and i prefer the font faces in places like "the book" anyway    guillaumegomez if the font can't be sans serif by default then some kind of option somewhere would be great  as  hellow554 pointed out it would be possible for users to just install a plugin in their browser and customise it themselves  but an option somewhere on the page that sets a cookie to remember font choice would be the best solution since it doesn't require users to know how to customise their browser 
probably yes  thank you   
ah  you're right  i'm sorry  when it crashed i didn't get a stack trace  i only got the one frame so i assumed it was something else going on 
sorry  i hadn't tested yet with stable  i just did  and with stable  rustc 1 29 0  aa3ca1994 2018 09 11  running on armv7 unknown linux gnueabihf  it also crashes  but now giving a different compiler error   error  internal compiler error  librustc_mir transform const_prop rs 619  const index not primitive   byref ptr pointer   alloc_id  allocid 12268   offset  size   raw  0       align   abi_pow2  2  pref_pow2  2     tylayout   ty  usize  details  layoutdetails   variants  single   index  0    fields  union 0   abi  scalar scalar   value  int i32  false   valid_range  0   4294967295     align  align   abi_pow2  2  pref_pow2  2    size  size   raw  4        src medium rs 431 69  431 91   do you have any pointers on how i can efficiently find out where in my code i have to look to isolate the offending code  i have no idea how to figure out a test case  as the crate contains a lot of code

i've deleted my last two comments    i'm running nightly now  hang on   
probably replaced  gonna update title 
yes and no  it solves part of the problem in that it would remove the  rustc  output if you remembered or even knew to do that  it obviously doesn't help with all of the  cargo  output  but my  cargo  pr would take care of that in either case  at the end of the day  this issue is mostly about expectations  as mentioned  there are hoops you can already jump through to mitigate this somewhat by specifying module restrictions  there's just an unfortunate conflation of application interface and tooling interface here that leads to surprising results  so that's what i was hoping to mitigate if possible 
probably a few days ago  then i hit  git clean  xfd  at root dir of the repo and cause llvm to be rebuilt 
i do not want that bufreader  i just ask could we merge two impl blocks 
 ehuss this isn't the exact same commit  but i already ran it and it's not so far off from the original code 
a ram disk  sized about 4gb
 hellow554 thanks for your explanation 
hi  sorry for the delay  thanks for the quick answer  in the code you can see  pub use crate  stream   stream  streamflags     where stream is a struct of the crat  it is shown in the documentation as  pub use crate  stream  stream   which is how it was intended  in the other hand  in the code there is also  pub use crate  memory   copydestination  devicebuffer  unifiedbuffer     to re export two other structs and one trait  but they are shown in the documentation in the structs and traits section inside the module prelude  as if there were a  # doc inline     which is not there  looking at the source code  i would think that all the re exports would be documented the same way  and i don't see a reason why some are documented differently  am i missing some  # doc no_inline     why would it be necessary in this case 
use rustup_init
in trying to get a solid reproduction  the issue has disappeared from the codebase i discovered it in  👻
i'm not that experienced with rust yet  sorry  i just wanted to point out this possible performance regression  shouldn't the instruction amount difference as shown on godbolt suffice to know that it's slower 
nightly  1 43 0 nightly  564758c4c 2020 03 08   does not ice
hum right  it's not possible then  would it be possible with a version of  unsize  defined like this   where the  unsize  function is basically in charge of converting a thin pointer into a fat one 
in the nightly version it takes about the same time as in stable 
i just tested with the latest nightly and it does  not  cause a compiler panic on nightly  in fact nightly gave me the necessary compiler errors to fix my code such that it successfully compiles on stable   
 centril yes  i get the error using rustc 1 41 0 nightly  bbb664a99 2019 11 28 
  unrelated    i know no one cares  but i solved my bug   +1 
can you make private appear as an “lock” icon  and public fields as an “lock open"  https   fontawesome com icons d gallery q lock to display all fields in the online documentation  and not in the local documentation 
the  std  sync  mutex  is good about ensuring every lock is also unlocked  but i'm interested in making an abstraction which ensures the programmer can never double lock  but could of course forget to unlock   the idea is that locking the mutex takes ownership of the mutex  rather than a reference to it  and the only way to get the mutex back is to unlock that thing  something like  of course it's possible i just don't know how to do what i want  i found that  with the  std  interface  because the  mutexguard  has a reference to the  mutex   it's impossible create the abstraction that i want  the programmer can always keep the  mutex  around after calling  lock     i can't move it to the same struct as the guard 
here's a full backtrace   hope it helps   
let me try   
and the last nightly to work was one from march ― but that was also from before i wrote the code that triggers the crash 
first  let me explain  i figured out what i was doing wrong   see at the bottom  but first here is my scenario  # start nodes to index something   bin elasticsearch  des gateway type fs  des gateway fs location  home lucene elasticsearch snapshot gateway  des index gateway snapshot_interval  1  des index engine robin refresh_interval  1  des http enabled false   bin elasticsearch  f  des node data false   curl  xput 'http   localhost 9200 twitter tweet 1'  d '   "user"  "kimchy"  "postdate"  "2009 11 15t13 12 00"  "message"  "trying out elastic search  so far so good "  '   curl  xget 'http   localhost 9200 twitter tweet 1 pretty true'   "_index"   "twitter"  "_type"   "tweet"  "_id"   "1"  "_source"     "user"  "kimchy"  "postdate"  "2009 11 15t13 12 00"  "message"  "trying out elastic search  so far so good "     # shutdown all nodes and start first data node and after that the non data node   curl  xpost 'http   localhost 9200 _cluster nodes _all _shutdown'   bin elasticsearch  des gateway type fs  des gateway fs location  home lucene elasticsearch snapshot gateway  des index gateway snapshot_interval  1  des index engine robin refresh_interval  1  des http enabled false   bin elasticsearch  f  des node data false   curl  xget 'http   localhost 9200 twitter tweet 1 pretty true'   "_index"   "twitter"  "_type"   "tweet"  "_id"   "1"  "_source"     "user"  "kimchy"  "postdate"  "2009 11 15t13 12 00"  "message"  "trying out elastic search  so far so good "     # shutdown all nodes and start first the non data node and after that the data   curl  xpost 'http   localhost 9200 _cluster nodes _all _shutdown'   bin elasticsearch  f  des node data false   bin elasticsearch  des gateway type fs  des gateway fs location  home lucene elasticsearch snapshot gateway  des index gateway snapshot_interval  1  des index engine robin refresh_interval  1  des http enabled false   curl  xget 'http   localhost 9200 twitter tweet 1 pretty true'   "error"   "indexmissingexception  twitter  missing " btw  even when i now shutdown the non data node and restart that non data node  these nodes donot "find" them  i guess     cannot xget a document  but at least  i figured that when i start the non data node with all the parameters used for the data node  it works    bin elasticsearch  f  des node data false  des gateway type fs  des gateway fs location  home lucene elasticsearch snapshot gateway  des index gateway snapshot_interval  1  des index engine robin refresh_interval  1 i was a little bit confused that it is necessary to parametrize a non data node with data parameters  but that will do it   
yup  you were right  maybe a better error message in the future

sorry for late response  yes  we were using memory index  we'were indexing documents  approximately 20k  and also querying indexes when above mentioned exception happened  not sure why it's happened

 spinscale need to get it from  costin   
 kimchy that's indeed what i was refering to and would be great if that would be settable there 
i tried again from a different network and it "just worked"  if it can't be reproduced  then feel free to close the issue
maybe this is something with my environment  i will attempt to track it down and reopen if necessary 
 simonw the query that caused the above oom was 3 5m of non pretty json  i pretty printed it and it was 43m  i have seen larger queries as well  ultimately the issue is on us for submitting an invalid query but i thought it was crazy we ended up crashing the client node  i think this could potentially happen even in a "normal" case if you have enough shards that fail and a smaller heap on the coordinating node  is the "source" pretty printed and converted to a string on the shard to include in the exception or does that happen on the client after deserialization 
i do not delete data in my indexing code  its just performing inserts  the application that performs the inserts is an http server written in go  if i do call delete explicitly i can see it happen in the logs   like so  2012 01 18 01 40 35 920  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  deleting index however  i am not seeing this  i am seeing this  2012 01 18 00 11 32 057  info   cluster metadata    tag    users   remove_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 11 32 110  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 11 32 500  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 11 32 779  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 23 23 058  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 24 59 086  info   cluster metadata    tag    users   remove_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 24 59 106  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 24 59 442  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 24 59 734  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 40 11 283  info   cluster metadata    tag    users   remove_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 40 11 306  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 40 11 683  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 40 12 460  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 54 25 358  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 56 26 375  info   cluster metadata    tag    users   remove_mapping  user   2012 01 18 00 56 26 389  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 56 26 770  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 00 56 27 054  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 01 01 26 416  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user   2012 01 18 01 06 29 784  info   cluster metadata    tag    users   remove_mapping  user   2012 01 18 01 06 29 808  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 01 06 30 150  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic   2012 01 18 01 06 30 420  info   cluster metadata    tag   users  update_mapping  user  dynamic  each time remove mapping is called it seems the old index is deleted and a new index is created  if i change the code in the http server from using 4 cpus and change it to use 1 cpu   the problem goes away   as in i dont see remove_mapping getting called and index keeps getting bigger  in go i do this to force it to use 1 cpu  runtime gomaxprocs 4  to runtime gomaxprocs 1 
not exactly    sorry  i was not clear enough  what i mean is this  let's suppose i have imaginary conditions condition1  condition2 and condition3  and i need to find all rows satisfying query   condition1    condition 2      condition 1 and condition3   this is just an example  in real life the query i have is pretty damned complex and i need to reuse some of it's conditions in many places  so what happens when i use this code   this way i'm actually able to reuse the condition throughout the query 
yes  now i know that there's no way to remove a setting  although it would be nice     i was not able to remove the empty string from the setting  the setting was applied using  1  close index 2  submit "update setting" with "merge_factor"   "" 3  open index     leads to an endless loop of exceptions in server log there was no way to close the index again and correct the setting

hi simon  sequence events was as follows    started indexing into a blank es  from a storm bolt connected to a stack overflow atom feed getting  30 docs every 10 seconds    fired up luke 3 5 to have a nose around the content in one of the shards   an error was reported by luke  presumably because of empty data   initiated a flush via one of the web based admin consoles   tried luke again  unsuccessful    managed to pull a power lead out by accident after reboot i entered this loop which looks like a corrupted index  it's small enough to email if of interest  i recognise there are some dodgy aspects to what i was doing here  no replicas  power outage and playing with luke on an empty then flushed index  but the tight loop on the es error reporting is probably something that warrants attention  cheers  mark on mon  jan 28  2013 at 3 25 pm  simon willnauer notifications github comwrote 
i'll see if i can set it up and test it  just 0 20 or also 0 90 
that's what is attached above  here it is in gist format  https   gist github com jaxxstorm c97e0e80f0b3d77bff4a
the use case is basically this  https   github com lmenezes elasticsearch kopf issues 10 meaning  that in order to allow cross domain requests i need to use jsonp  and doing that with jquery  it automatically adds a callback parameter to the url    so  i finally get a index callback is not dynamic error  i just wonder now  if its possible to not throw an exception when the parameter is not actually a existing parameter like what happens to cluster settings  where unknown parameters are just ignored  could it be possible 
sure  thanks   
 brwe you're right  sorry for the noise  it was a stupid mistake on my part  i corrected the related gist  thanks for your feedback 
that sounds like a useful feature  but this issue asks for a key_script in place key_field attribute if the user needs it  and if i understand correctly your pr enhances the value_script field only

hello  spinscale  thank you for following this up  showing an error mentioning the email format would be more explicit for the user 
i believe i linked to both of those outputs in my original post  are you looking for something different 
either for it to ignore the body and respond with the settings or provide a relevant exception saying that sending body is not allowed with this api
my cluster is 1 3 2 only  btw   _cat nodes  is painfully slow  
the difference is in freshness of data  10s is for constantly updating current index  200 400ms is for cold index with data from yesterday  indices are rotated daily 
i'm using v0 90 2  i can't reproduce this issue  both "term" and "terms" are working on a facet_filter  i was querying elasticsearch with raw json with the head plugin  you can close this issue now  i'll repoen it if i ever trigger this again  sorry about that 
hi spinscale  thanks for looking into this  unofficial rpms are  https   github com tavisto elasticsearch rpms note that the repro above was done using puppet   which suggests that we may have to examine if puppet is doing the equivalent of  rpm  uvh

hi simon  i'll send a stacktrace asap  implementing the run   method for a custom score is kind of a nonsense to me if you implement a custom score plugin  the only thing i see is to have a default implementation returning current doclookup  versions prior to 0 90 4 were not calling run   for a custom score plugin  i started mine based on igor motov examples found here   https   github com imotov elasticsearch native script example  maybe i did something wrong though    regards  yann barraud le 21 sept  2013 21 46  "simon willnauer" notifications github com a écrit

i've found this in my elasticsearch log    ps   my log level is  debug  and there is nothing before after this message 
sure thing  i will do that today 
to be able to add it to log messages we create in non test implementations of the same interface  see also full changes here  #14827
1 5 2 on el6 other close log entries only show a few unrelated  other index  parse failures
i found this happening on 1 3 1 also  with the compressed recovery bug  i haven't had recovery failures since then so i have no more data to gauge this with    on sun  sep 14  2014 at 10 13 pm  suitingtseng notifications github com wrote 
always more than happy to do benchmarks  i should have done one before opening this issue  but now we have something for future googlers  a simple query  on cached hot data   type access_logs   size 0     for i in    seq 1 100    do  curl  s    dev null  done    0 17s user 0 32s system 1  cpu 46 681 total  search_type count     for i in    seq 1 100    do  curl  s    dev null  done    0 15s user 0 34s system 1  cpu 45 664 total  ran each test 3 times  took the middle result  basically  no difference  i tried with some more complex queries  the difference between the two was always negligible  even on cold data  the requests took longer but the difference was pretty much nothing  which leads me to wonder  in which situations should search_type count be faster 
it happens for different tests   there doesn't seem to be a pattern  the tests index some documents   then run searches or aggregations   some tests use scrolling api  our tests are configured thus 
yes     that's one way  just that search and count api's are inconsistent  one returns the index name other doesnt
fyi  oom stacktrace 
 clintongormley thanks for the response  we were able to reproduce it 1 0 1 but once we upgraded 1 1 0 it went away  i see that https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch pull 5413 and https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch pull 5440 got fixed in 1 1 0  maybe they were related  either way  we're good  thank you 
no  i searched one index only and it contains geo_point type for location field  it is strange that i tried again  it worked fine first  then i tried to search with query_string  it threw classcastexception exception  and then i back to try to search with match_all  it threw classcastexception again  i tried with the same procedures that elasticsearch server book mentioned  create mapping    "mappings"     "poi"     "properties"     "name"     "type"   "string"    "location"     "type"   "geo_point"           post data    "name"   "new york"  "location"   "40 664167   73 938611"   and then query    "query"     "matchall"         "sort"      "_geo_distance"     "location"   "48 8567  2 3508"  "unit"   "km"       
sounds good  can we add the index name reference though      so end users will not have to query the index settings api to figure out where these settings are originally set 
i have several thousand polygons that result in this error  i have not pulled them all out of the logs yet  i will hopefully have time to do that today  on mon  apr 14  2014 at 1 08 am  alexander reelsen  notifications github com
happy to  bleskes
i tried multi_fiield and it works as what i wanted  the mapping i use is similar to what  brwe mentioned   thank you for the hint  s1monw  
 javanna will do  my class is in the default package  would that be the problem 
this is what my mapping looks like  curl  s  xput "http   localhost 9200 test "  d '  "settings"    "index number_of_shards"  1  "index number_of_replicas"  0    "mappings"    "city"    "properties"    "city"   "type"  "string"   "state"   "type"  "string" "index"  "not_analyzed"   "population"   "type"  "integer"         ' my scenario is  i have a custom plugin that client has to call as a script field  and as soon as we specify script fields  we don't get all the regular fields document by default in search response  i have so many fields in the index  above is just the test   i don't want them to specify each field  so looking for something like all fields and i saw    but it doesn't seems to be working for me 
i use term suggester like this http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current search suggesters html   and my url is this  http   10 20 9 50 9200 testindex _suggest param is     "my suggestion"     "text"   "zhong guo"  "term"     "field"   "pinyin"       and i have 2000 word in field   "pinyin"
here is a simple test that demonstrate the "bug"   first create a doc    pre  code  curl  xpost http   localhost 9200 test content pretty  d '  position  2  '   code   pre  then try to rescore without specific sort order  so score is used     pre  code  curl  xpost http   localhost 9200 test content _search pretty  d '  rescore     window_size  10  query     rescore_query     function_score    boost_factor   10          '   code   pre  into the result the score is 11 just as expected    pre  code    "took"   1  "timed_out"   false  "_shards"     "total"   5  "successful"   5  "failed"   0    "hits"     "total"   1  "max_score"   11 0  "hits"       "_index"   "test"  "_type"   "content"  "_id"   "pgd5f6kest vpq5 czmxbw"  "_score"   11 0  "_source"   position  2              code   pre  now trying to executes the rescore with position as sort order    code  pre  curl  xpost http   localhost 9200 test content _search pretty  d '  sort    position  "asc"   track_scores  true  rescore     window_size  10  query     rescore_query     function_score    boost_factor   10          '   code   pre  i was expected the same behavior than previously but the score into the result the score is now 1    code  pre    "took"   0  "timed_out"   false  "_shards"     "total"   5  "successful"   5  "failed"   0    "hits"     "total"   1  "max_score"   1 0  "hits"       "_index"   "test"  "_type"   "content"  "_id"   "pgd5f6kest vpq5 czmxbw"  "_score"   1 0  "_source"   position  2  count_views  3    "sort"     2             code   pre  my real use cases is more complicated but the idea is to apply a rescore on a small subset of document and get a secondary sort order for docs at the same position  it is not possible even when adding  in my opinion the track_scores param should be applied to the full chain of the query including rescores 
we have documents that store references to each other  each document can reference multiple other documents  or none at all  each set of inter referential documents are discrete  forming thousands of isolated document clusters  the references are stored in an array like field  the use case is to be able to aggregate on these clusters  to be able  for example    to count the number of clusters   to find the biggest cluster   to be able to get a single document that best represents a cluster  i e  top_hit after sorting a cluster    etc hope that makes more sense  p s  to clarify  in our case we'd be using  overlap 1  because one term in common between documents  would be enough to cluster the way we want  the idea to allow varying it was to hopefully make it more useful for others that may wish to use it 
i left objecttest as a valid example of object that can no be deseralized casted  my objects are more complex so far but the essence is the same  the native script can't cast to the original object  i have seen that sending lists or maps works but also for strings or numbers  oviously  if the serialization is done by tostring method the only thing i'm going to have on the other side is going to be the pointer reference  i dont understand why they are being converted to json  it's java code talking to java code 
yeah i know that this may be an issue when relocation happens  the use case is that i'd like to know if i can force optimize if the index is not active for long enough time  this is doable when i add update timestamp to each document which brings significant overhead and requires reindexing  this is also doable when i have an approximate time of last modification of index files  the other option is to expose all segments hash tags so i can compare if index changed or not  keeping old hash tags outside of es   any other thought 
yes i know but this does not change the fact that i have to manually adjust the value of  recovery max_bytes_per_sec  after recovery is done  not to let rebalance take to much iops and network  this is what i thought before i changed  recovery max_bytes_per_sec  which significantly speeded up the recovery  i didn't look at the output of flush because it was too big      but let's look at another screenshot  doesn't it look suspicious  you can see that when  recovery max_bytes_per_sec  has lower value there is longer time of "no network activity" and recovery is still in progress  first chart presents the number of unassigned shards and the second shows the total network traffic in the cluster  if shards are not synced correctly we'd see much higher network traffic  no    selection_662  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6692291 19036184 750cf652 896e 11e6 9888 f493215d27e1 png 
no worries  when i delete index from elasticsearch i got hole in kibana from 2 00    2 00 not midnight    midnight  we got different timezone than utc  every midnight logrotate save new file on servers  when we want for whatever reason to delete elasticsearch index  recreate index and forward logs one more time then i need to grep like crazy because logrotated log isn't fitting the index 
i hv deleted that snapshot  there was only reason like repo is missing  i hv checked log and found out following       2014 08 22 11 42 25 316  info   snapshots    node1  snapshot  modesearch snapshot_22_aug 2014 9 50  is done  2014 08 22 09 48 54 349  warn   snapshots    node2    index  3    modesearch snapshot_22_aug 2014 9 50  failed to create snapshot meanwhile i have started again and its in process     snapshot_25_aug 2014 01 30 "snapshots"       "snapshot"   "snapshot_25_aug 2014 01 30"  "repository"   "modesearch"  "state"   "started"  "shards_stats"     "initializing"   6  "started"   2  "finalizing"   2  "done"   0  "failed"   0  "total"   10   
i was checking snapshot status api on browser  i e  _snapshot snapshot snapshot_22_aug 2014 _status
i found the cause of the problem  our logstash used the basic mapping template   that caused elasticsearch guess the type of the metric field  no type specified by default   most of the times the new index created with metric as double but in sometimes with metric as long  so i forced metric field to be double by adding   to the _default_ section in the logstash template thank you all for making such awesome product  +1 
hi brwe  thanks for your comment  what you suggest is useful  although it doesn't quite achieve what i am after  if i use your approach with  1 n   then i will sometimes get 0 documents  or sometimes several documents  if i understood correctly   what i am after is a method that will get me exactly 1 document each time 
 brwe could you please explain how this workaround would look like  i'm not sure i understand your proposal correcly  thanks 
 clintongormley i am sorry but i couldn't reporoduce it anymore and don't have the stack trace 
got it  found isexists and issourceempty method in getresponse   many thanks 
 clintongormley here is it   and mmquery is multimatchquerybuilder object  and andsearchfilter is a boolquerybuilder object  note  we got this issue under 500 1000 2000 concurrent performance test 
i need it because otherwise i need to structure my indexes as though every possible string value has another level of hierarchy just in case i want to index it twice in the future  i already have an index structure which is highly nested and this makes it more unwieldy and seems like a hack       it just seemed a logical extension to me… with behaviour like copy to  cheers r from  clinton gormley  mailto notifications github com  sent  10 july 2015 17 43 to  elastic elasticsearch cc  rob tice subject  re   elasticsearch  dynamic templates  #12169  hi  rob tice https   github com rob tice there are no plans to support this  why do you need this feature  what's the problem with description value text instead of description value_text  — reply to this email directly or view it on github https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 12169#issuecomment 120455330   https   github com notifications beacon adlulbe gsxrgjcqm hm5kgbl rzldueks5ob 2ugajpzm4fvhxp gif
yea  sorry i wasn't clear enough originally  it's with all pipeline aggregations 
i'm still try to reproduce like a integration test  but without success  but at our test cluster  this bug also manually reproduced  and looks like this  2 nodes 1 4 2 with centos and oracle jvm 8  first node contains shards 1 4 5 7  second contains 0 2 3 6  8 total  0 replicas  query   i have this error only if query executed at second node  if first  all is ok  with search shards api  looks like 3016 route to 7th shard  second node does not contain 7th  but first does  any ideas 
what do you mean by it does not fit in the screen  the problem is caused by the has_child filter  the filter works fine by it's on  i removed some parts of the filter and removed indentation so you can see the filter 
fount it  it was es javalib mismatch since my old libs were lying around in classpath  which was hard to find out  thank you for your attention 
i realized that long in java little more than php  and this caused a problem  google finds many such problems  the problem is not elastcisearch 
yeah  of course  just need time to test all "paths" options like   synonyms_path   and   stopwords_path   to ensure they are all must be in the config folder  i'll provide a pr in a couple of days 
 javanna yes  it is  by the way  i can't believe that this bug has been out there for almost one year  this bug is so hard to debug and caused a lot of confusion in our project  since normally people use  tostring    for debug purpose  the bug could be fixed by the following code at least 
 spinscale 1    i don't know if it's happens on a non scripted field   i don't have any fields that are always the same ratio of another field for comparison 2  https   gist github com yehosef f96dc491bcd5ee9bf7d3 is the query i also included the index template   perhaps it's related to doc_values  3  i'm not sure if i can share the data right now   if you contact me at my name at gmail  i can probably give you temp access to the marvel kibana install  because store is off for everything  you can't see the values but it might help in the debug  if that doesn't help we can look at giving access to the data  to give some background   this is a testing server to test load capabilities for a server  we have storing all fields to "off" and are using doc_values  it's a single 16g machine with 8g heap   220m rows   60g storage

i think both should be supported  i see a use case for both methods 
 javanna i installed elasticseach through "yum install elasticseach"    es_home    usr share elasticsearch    es_home lib  does have the jar  current user does have read access 
our use case might be a little bit special   we use it to store quadkeys  geohash is not suitable for us  and to spread items evenly on map tiles by prefix aggregation  currently simulated by filters   however  aggregating items by a prefix of certain length seems to be quite a legit and general use case   one might want to group items to buckets by their prefixes  see http   stackoverflow com questions 23067983 term aggregation consider only the prefix to aggregate  which can be quite useful for any string codes or hashes that have some defined structure  a more general way to look at it is that one could use strings as any type of tree structures  binary 0110     quadtree 01032     etc   and aggregate items in subtrees by their prefix  geohash aggregation is a special case of a more general "string prefix aggregation"    some more details about our use case    we use custom quadkeys instead of geohash since it allows as to query items on a map per tile  as they are really displayed on the map   a simple query to get top items for a particular tile would be something like "_get n items with quadkey prefix p sorted by rating r with limit l_"  however  this could return many items in one particular region of the tile  they have all high rating  an we would not be able to display them all anyway because they would overlap  while other regions would be empty   to spread the items on a tile we want to group them by a prefix longer than the quadkey of the tile and get some top hits from each of the groups  each tile is thus partitioned in 4  16  64  etc  subregions depending on the prefix length   this is equivalent to geohash aggregation  but it is much more general 
unfortunately we're searching against multiple fields with different analyzers  the field we  want  this wildcard to match is already using a different analyzer designed for symbols  which doesn't have this problem  the false positives are coming from a more general arbitrary text field which does use the classic tokenizer

 jpountz  clintongormley i opened this issue not only to see if we can do something to speed up this  but also to maybe think about a documentation change to make sure that everyone does an  exists  wrapped by a  constant_score   that is what it gives the best results  also  visiting all the documents doesn't make any sense as when using  exists  we usually don't want the top documents  but just to filter those documents as soon as the field exists or not  should we change the recommendation from  bool must_not exists  to  constant_score filter bool must_not exists

hey all  i'm not at home right now but will provide a detailed explanation when i'm able to  may be later tonight  or tomorrow at the latest  for now i'll go by memory while fat thumbing on my phone  high level answers    don't know what version of java i'm using off the top of my head  i'm using the elasticsearch docker repo  which i _think_ uses java 7    don't believe there were any shard failures  the bulk api didn't report any errors on any of the create responses  though i haven't checked es logs  marvel is reporting all shards as good    didn't call refresh  though that's a great suggestion  but i wasn't querying _count immediately afterwards either  my understanding is by default everything is refreshed about every 0 5 seconds  even if i let the index sit for a bit  say  10 minutes   count would still report fewer docs than the original index    the number forever rested at the lower number  the original index had 44 754  when i migrated it with scan size of 200  x 5 shards   1000 docs per bulk post   the migrated index was 44 709  the odd thing is if i did this multiple times  using that same scan size  it was always 44 709  i decided to drop the scan size to 100  thinking perhaps i was overloading or something  and migrated again  this time the count dropped to 43 665  i think   now that i'm looking at it  this seems like a pattern  it appears as though i'm missing about 1 document for every scan bulk cycle    the scan bulk is done using a simple app i wrote in clojure  in a nutshell  1  scan with the scan size of x on the old index  using match_all  2  using the scoll_id returned by 1  hit the scroll api  _search scroll     i then create "create" request for each document returned by scan  interleaving the "create" with each doc i'm migrating  the "create" contains the target index  type  and existing id for the respective doc  3  after the bulk call i repeat step 2 using the scroll id returned by the previous scroll call  wash  rinse  repeat until hits on the call to scroll is 0  like i said  it seems as though i'm missing 1 doc for each scan bulk cycle  perhaps it's something in my script  but after specifying the scan size in the origian scan call  i don't rely on the number ever again  i simply iterate over every document  i can provide more details later  such as an excerpt of the bulk calls  etc  for now  thoughts    ryan  on sun  may 31  2015 at 8 35 am  simon willnauer notifications github com wrote 
ok  sorry for incomplete description  i re describe the question again  i have a amount of docs in indices in es  e g
 s1monw correct in infix observation   but it could potentially be used for more than this  currently we do the following to achieve infix matches   as discussed  however  this would lead to potential abuse and is not a good generic addition  closing 
hmm    to be honest  i have completion suggesters in my mapping  but not in the documents i was bulk indexing  the bulk indexing process should have been the only process that was running at the time of the exception  the bulk indexer is shuffling data over from one type to another in the same index  no deletions  no updates  just bulk index requests  is it possible that it's caused by something that es does in the background  unfortunately i don't have access to the mapping right now  but i can send it to you tomorrow if that helps  there's multiple completion suggesters for about 3 different types  we're in the process of updating an es 1 x mapping to es 5 x  so i'm not even sure if something's wrong on our side  i'm personally not a pro with suggesters tbh  
i pushed a recreate to https   github com mikerott es_issue_12251  also to answer the question  yes i do override setup   teardown  you'll see in the github project that some of them are empty and do not call super    or super teardown   or whatever  that's only the case because i was using the legacy project to produce the recreate scenario  however  that's a good observation  and i will be playing with changes in there 
yeah that makes sense  but my fear is that something like a sorting option in the cat api might be considered a low priority feature request  whereas in this case i think the new behaviour is a regression that actually has a surprisingly negative #ux impact when trying to investigate a large cluster with 30 40+ nodes 
my elasticsearch settings 
cool  thanks for the answer  i did not realize you had a forum 
oh  i am using java on java 8    the client and server version is 1 7 1 i've a feeling this may be related to java 8 unless somehow an incompatible groovy jar got in the way 
i can't show u the exact ip address  thing is  when execute _nodes stats  most nodes show below  "transport_address"  "inet  172 0 0 1 9300 " but there is one node shows  "transport_address"  "inet 172 0 0 2 172 0 0 2 9300 "  i guess the format shoud be ip port  but why this one shows ip ip port
of course red node is "stats node 01"
i can show it to you using teamviewer on my dev computer  can you add me to skype or telegram by nickname erickskrauch 
for consistency i mean    if an operation fails api should return '  "acknowledged"   false  '   if an operation doesn't fail api should return '  "acknowledged"   true  ' right now the operation doesn't fail and the api returns fail  do you suggest something like use a timeout parameters to an infinite number  in that case you'll probably wait forever but the response should be consistent  right 
 imotov  dadoonet my solution of this problem in production is only give all the   index_name    shard_num  dir 777 permission in fsblobstore  that make different shards in different user can write blobstorerepo  should we add a config item like "repositories fs open_write_permission" and control this  if you think this is nessisary  i can give a pr on it 
see https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 11882
unfortunately the logs are not creating  i followed the ansible playbook https   github com traackr ansible elasticsearch there is no error message when it starts  its starts ok  but when i check the status it shows stopped http   pastebin com uqh8ctth
hey  is there any estimate of when if this will get implemented  and if so  will it reach es v2 x as well 
hey  nik9000  i am pretty sure  there is no spike in app server requests  or in traffic between the app servers and es nodes  we have never been able to replicate this problem locally  only under a real production load  and even then  it will be fine for 12 hours  with some errors here and there no big deal  and then all of a sudden she fires up  like in the graph above  and we see cpu usage spike  restart nodes  rinse wash and repeat 
the cluster was in a bit of stress at that time  that might have added some lag to the overall processing  unfortunately i do not see how many times it was actually called with this type of cpu analysis  but i will do a more detailed sampling to get better numbers to rule out that other threads did steal most of the time here actually   
 clintongormley i was using elasticsearch 2 0 and got the following error script_score query does not support  file  it is possible i was doing something else wrong but when i changed "file" to "script_file" it worked   
i am using ipv4 and linux 64 bit   i am trying to configure 3 es nodes on one physical box  the old version of es works fine without any issues  now i am upgrading it to latest es    uname  a linux           l 2 6 18 371 9 1 el5 #1 smp tue may 13 06 52 49 edt 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux   cat  etc redhat release red hat enterprise linux server release 5 10  tikanga 
sorry  but there is still an error when install medcl elasticsearch analysis pinyin  could you please take a look  thanks 
i did not see the translog fail flush message in the logs  i do have an ongoing recovery of shards  which i pause during the day to not interfere with indexing  the cluster contains 10tb or so of data  +replication   at the moment there are 36 unassigned shards remaining  shards and stats attached  slightly obfuscated    stats txt  https   github com elastic elasticsearch files 81450 stats txt   shards txt  https   github com elastic elasticsearch files 81449 shards txt 
yes  i will work on a pr for this 
i should note that highlighting on  text stemmed  works perfectly fine in a regular search  not in an aggregation  
hi rjernst  thank you for your answer  actually i'm using a dockerfile  below  i just changed the image i'm pulling  2 1 to 2 2   i have a 3 nodes setup   node 0 1 2   any idea   thanks for your help 
just tested with match_all  works as expected  also works when just doing the  bool  query  without the  function_score   seems to be the combination of the 2  i'll build out a test case and post it 
hi  s1monw thanks for answering  you're right  the process method was in it was  restfilter  which i anonymously instantiated from my impl of  baseresthandler   nevertheless  i still would like to know if there is a way to inject a header in the restresponse without creating a new  restresponse  object  i e  from  restfilter#process   here's the code example required  https   github com sscarduzio elasticsearch readonlyrest plugin blob master src main java org elasticsearch plugin readonlyrest wiring readonlyrestrestaction java#l44 once again  i don't intend to create the response object myself  i just want to inject an extra header on whatever response will come back from es 
https   discuss elastic co  take lot of time to open can you please tell me the way how to solve my problem please
sure  thank you for the response  please find the issue link for your reference  https   discuss elastic co t access doc count in scripted metric section 56371 you can close this issue from here 
yes  i believe #16963 will help satisfy the spirit of the request as i'm using this output to determine what the cluster type is  however  i'd still prefer the values to be explicitly set  personally i always prefer explicit over implicit as it avoids confusion  i also find 'true' to be an unexpected default  for booleans i assume the default will be 'false'  though i suppose if that's documented and i missed it then it's okay  i'd would also like to point out that the master is returning 'master  true' and not omitting it as a default  as i mentioned above i prefer this behavior and think it would be beneficial if the data node could behave the same as well  thanks 
we keep track of the thread pool usage  and raising it to 1000 was an attempt to see the behavior  the number of threads being used goes around 5 15  it only reaches to 100 when the heap is taken  so that's a side effect 
thanks for that advice  root host     usr share elasticsearch bin elasticsearch plugin remove hq    removing hq    root host     etc init d elasticsearch start starting elasticsearch    ok  
yes   in multi machine room ， one for all normal use  primary + replicate process client request，but in a accident   this room all nodes power failure，so another room with a sets replicate can be continue process client request   thanks  
this is with branch 2 3  also i missed to mention that i am observing this on the powerpc platform 
i think i finally understood where the issue originates but i'm not sure of how to easily replicate it  i'm not familiar enough with github issues to know if i can move this one or if i have to duplicate it because it seems to be a logstash problem  the elasticsearch plugin in logstash seems to be the cause of the problem  whenever i insert or update anything using "action    update" in logstash  the ips give problems because it doesn't properly parse the array of ips  triggering the error mentioned by  colings86  for example  below is a new document being indexed with logstash using update  this is an excerpt of the logstash log     timestamp  "2016 06 28t02 48 01 215000+0000"   message  "failed action  "   status  400   action   "update"    _id  "2667500489 mars orderbox dns com "   _index  "full"   _type  "a"   _routing  nil   _retry_on_conflict  1   # logstash  event 0x3b5cf2c6  metadata_accessors # logstash  util  accessors 0x4053d7b9  store      lut       cancelled false   data  " version"  "1"  " timestamp"  "2016 06 28t02 47 08 358z"  "zone"  "com"  "sign"  "+"  "domain_name"  "2667500489 mars orderbox dns com "  "type"  "a"  "ip_address"   "162 251 82 124"  "162 251 82 125"  "162 251 82 252"  "162 251 82 253"   "domain_name_exact"  "2667500489 mars orderbox dns com "  "domain_name_length"  33  "is_registered"  true  "last_registered"  "2016 05 01t10 00 00 000 0500"  "registered_history"   "2016 05 01t10 00 00 000 0500"   "deregistered_history"      "ip_address_exact"   "162 251 82 124"  "162 251 82 125"  "162 251 82 252"  "162 251 82 253"     metadata         omitted for brevity      response   "update"   "_index"  "full"  "_type"  "a"  "_id"  "2667500489 mars orderbox dns com "  "status"  400  "error"   "type"  "mapper_parsing_exception"  "reason"  "failed to parse  ip_address "  "caused_by"   "type"  "illegal_argument_exception"  "reason"  "failed to parse ip  162 251 82 124 162 251 82 125 162 251 82 252 162 251 82 253   not a valid ip address"       level   warn  
ok  clintongormley  don't have my working machine with me  i will try java8 in 3 4 hours
as i use elasticsearchoperations as wrapper for index creation and searching  the problem is i can't access jest api without braking the abstraction layer  i then must work with two "approaches dependent of the use case index search"   as i would to go along which spring as far as possible until thiy feature is available  i have  as you see above  an switch to configure if i use the embedded es  for dev env  or the external es  for cloud stage   i would additional need to manage an "loop" connection for jest queries on the embedded es if that is even possible   i have no spring  auto  configuration support here 
 rjernst maybe can be a problem using sbt + scala  after your comment i've created a simple maven project and dependencies are correctly downloaded  i'll verify why 5 0 0 alpha5 download all dependencies using sbt and beta1 doesn't   i'm closing it 
we're using local volumes for each node  so i don't know how they would have gotten mixed  in the meantime  i resolved this by restoring an earlier snapshot  from before the failure   there might have been a little bit of lost data from the time between the snapshot and the failure  but it's minimal  after restoring from backup  the cluster was able to re index successfully  i would have left it alone for troubleshooting if it were anything other than our production cluster  but we couldn't afford to be down for too long 
hi  clintongormley   please see the versions above  i get no suggestions when run against the 4 indices that are different 
indeed  i was inadvertently passing a map builder instead of a map and it was going through the varargs method instead of the map specific one 
i have already asked there but nobody has replied  that's why i have asked here 
i am not using the  indexrequest  but the index source document  i guess i can switch to using  indexrequest  
https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 5 0 index modules slowlog html if this is not allowed anymore  is there any other way we can set the slowlog globally  or maybe on multiple indices simultaneously  instead of defining it manually on each index  having time series indices which are created daily  seem to mean we have to set the option on daily basis on the new index 
this last comment seems to defy the purpose of class loaders  of course an identical class can be at several places in the class path  that's what class loaders hierarchies are for  what's the point of loading plugins in their own class loader if they cannot have their own private version of a class present elsewhere in their parent class loader's class path  can you elaborate on what you are trying to protect the plugins from 
we've got some graphs that corresponds to this issue for simular cluster  as you can see  we've run out all search threads and requests are accumulating in queue  and at the same time thread pool rejection rate remains about 1 per second  which is strange  also  what http code is using in case when task is be rejected  as i remember there were no 429 codes  only ones of 50x    es_queue  https   user images githubusercontent com 14976219 35941856 ca224dc0 0c64 11e8 8e46 aff2f5d46f30 png

i docker exec'ed into the  elasticsearch 2  and from there i did a  curl http   elasticsearch 1 9200 _nodes transport pretty 1  this is the output that i get
sorry  i did not describe the problem clearly for example there are two indexes and types of parent documents indicesquery is ok，using _index will have an error type that does not exist in the index
after the restart i saw almost twice the disk usage on each node  compared to after the rebalance was complete  this leads me to think a complete rebalance and prune was done  total data shift on all nodes   this is a bit alarming  as this means a potential cluster restart could lead to a x2 disk requirement depending on how the nodes recover  but perhaps this is unavoidable and i hit an edge case  a wipe of old stale data on the nodes does seem to have happened though and node diskusage is back to normal after the rebalance 
thanks for your reply  i expected no object to move to the old generation area  so i would like to know what   why unreachable objects is living in old generation  this information will be very helpful to me

hello sir  i use elasticsearch 5 1 2 add i already install the x pack  i use following maven dependencies   but i am not able to use x pack library which you use in your java program
 dadoonet going to do this  it's quite big enough 
 abhiroj if you know something about saml and have an environment to test in  then that would be great  the hard work on this issue will be making sure it is compliant with the spec  and works with major saml idps  the actual development work is fairly straight forward 
ok  i've tried something different  i changed the mapping etc  to have the same set up as in the documentation  new field   just for clarification  there is no suggestion missing  i'm looking for "bohrer" which is returned for confidence 0  what i noticed is the following  when i create a fresh index and start to index data  at the beginning everything is working with confidence "1"  and at some point  which seems not really deterministic   i have to adjust the confidence value to "0" to get any result  i don't get it  in my opinion the set up is the same as in the documentation  is there still a weird configuration  i will try to distill a dataset that reproduces this behaviour  but this seems to be difficult 
 jasontedor i know that the number is insanely great  and i doubt it can be reached in regular operation  still  the exception clearly indicates a negative value  and assuming that  scrolltimeinmillis  is always positive  i can give no better explanation than a numeric overflow  this is the stacked grafana graph of  scrolltimeinmillis  of our 12 node setup  the overflow happens at 292 years  approx at 9222842861407 ms     grafana metrics es5 scrolltimeinmillis  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1222566 24157363 77e62342 0e59 11e7 8d90 caf54b915e2c png  the metrics are polled from the first node which is still able to return the negative value  but the inter cluster communication to sync the local stats between the nodes is obviously broken by the exception thrown in  searchstats stats writeto  
sry  next time i double check the repo   
always good to double check  problem with having a dev instance  production  where this problem is occurring  is running   5 2 1   i should be able to bump production up to 5 3 this coming week and can verify it's addressed there 
badly our cluster has re create by ops  in new cluster we can not reproduce this issues either  just close it and re open if we enable reproduce
hi   thank you for your reply  i have big amount of text to highlight  i read that fvh highlighter is the fastest highlighter  especially when it comes to a large amount of data  so you mean when it comes to performance both fvh and unified highlighter has now same performance  
the problem has been resolved  the reason is our apps's customer call bulk api by click script  it will read a lots of elasticsearch data  but less api request  we should monitor elasticsearch by apps  so we can found the reason at first time  thx all

i am using version 5 4 2  my index is infrequently updated  say once in a day  here is what my query looks like 
what you said makes a lot of sense  i combined your suggestion with an observation from my colleague  gndcshv where he pointed out that since i was asking for the same id there might be some caching before the request hit elastic search  better to use different id's  so  i combined those 2 suggestions and now i get expected behavior   so   not a bug   thnx   the new verification script is  cluster http   localhost 9200 curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 1  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 2  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 3  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 4  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 5  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 6  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 7  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 8  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 9  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  x put  cluster pest mouse 0  d '  "sound"  "squeak"  ' curl  cluster pest mouse 1 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 2 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 3 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 4 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 5 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 6 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 7 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 8 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 9 sleep 1 curl  cluster pest mouse 0 sleep 60 curl  x get  cluster _all _stats pretty   jq " indices pest primaries get total" # this returns only 2 curl  x get  cluster _all _stats pretty   jq " indices pest total get total" # this returns 10  which is correct  
 nik9000 no worries  i'll write this up soon  i figured there must be some mechanism for this already  thanks for explaining it  another thought i had with the   1  default  requests_per_second  setting was that i wonder if the reindex api just keeps queuing up the scroll searches until it fills the queue  but with a   1  search size effecting the depth calculation  i wonder if it was then blowing it out to try to queue  1001  scroll requests  thus resulting in the error  my intuition would be that if this thought had any substance it would result in a max scroll request of  999   and not  1001   i have no evidence that this is the case  just a passing thought  i don't see how it should effect the queue depth anyway if that is being managed separately   just coming up with ideas here   andy elastic there are two size directives in the reindex api  my goal is to reindex a relatively large index  so i'm referring to the size of the scroll as specified in the  source  object  this setting will be limited by the  index max_result_window  which is  10000  by default if i remember correctly  i'm running the stock value for this setting  i found that i would hit this error relatively quickly at the  1000  default setting  although never at the exact same point  i could never managed to reindex a whole index with the default settings  when i increased it to the maximum  10000  scroll size  it would make it through a lot more documents before hitting the error  allowing to reindex many of my smaller indices   markharwood all very good points  we have 10 unique kibana instances running with multiple users  the actual search usage is pretty low and ad hoc mostly when investigating something  we do have some dashboards that are periodically captured and displayed as images on some tv around our various it departments  i don't believe these update anymore than once every 5 minutes  i also noticed this behaviour in relatively low es utilisation  unfortunately i don't have any metrics regarding average search requests per second  but i'm pretty confident that the large majority  +90   would be coming from the reindex api  in terms of data points  i've been spending the past week attempting to reindex after hitting the bug in  kibana 5 5 0  https   github com elastic kibana issues 12728  to weed out my field conflicts 
if you are not setting the nodes  the default is used  the default is defined in  basetasksrequest  like this   but if you set the nodes to an empty list   which means you explicitly override  all_nodes    in  basetasksrequest  this is not respected  because it calls a resolver that resolves the empty list back to  all_nodes     context    tasks are used in transform  a transform can have a running task or not  depending on whether the transform is active or not  for  _transform _stats  transform collects the nodes where tasks are running to avoid unnecessary network calls  this list might be empty  note  that i can fix the problem directly in the implementation of transform  however i think it would be cleaner to fix the api  its counter intuitive to say  do not call anyone and it does quite the opposite  the same problem exists in the ml plugin

 colings86 thanks for your confirmation  we are kinda already using the workaround you suggested  however it's one of those annoying things to remember especially when it's not necessarily intuitive  we use the _meta field for a couple of reasons  1  the date fields that we define in our mapping are all consistently stored as one format but when we retrieve from es  we represent in various formats so we track the different formats in the _meta field so that as we are transforming the json we get from es we can apply the applicable transformation before sending it further upstream in our application  i am sure there are other ways of achieving this but this seems to work well for us  2  we have a few nested field mappings defined and we keep track of the nested paths within the _meta field  we have a query generator routine that dynamically generates the es queries based upon the fields passed in and we pull nested paths information from the _meta field so that we can determine if a nested path should be incorporated into the query or not  hope this helps 
hi  hohol  i can't assign issues outside of the elastic organisation  but you're welcome to work on this 
i tried enabling debugging to see if there was any actual useful info but this is all i was able to get  but then i lowered my replicas to 0 and it connected right when the cluster went green  basically i can repo this by getting the cluster into a yellow state and then spinning up a new node   2017 11 24t00 15 54 894  debug  c a a aws4signer   generating a new signing key as the signing key not available in the cache for the date 1511481600000  2017 11 24t00 15 54 894  debug  c a h c s sdktlssocketfactory  socket getsupportedprotocols     sslv2hello  sslv3  tlsv1  tlsv1 1  tlsv1 2   socket getenabledprotocols     tlsv1  tlsv1 1  tlsv1 2   2017 11 24t00 15 54 894  debug  c a h c s sdktlssocketfactory  tls protocol enabled for ssl handshake   tlsv1 2  tlsv1 1  tlsv1   2017 11 24t00 15 54 895  debug  c a h c s sdktlssocketfactory  connecting to ec2 ap southeast 1 amazonaws com 52 95 35 53 443  2017 11 24t00 15 54 943  debug  c a i sdksslsocket   created  ec2 ap southeast 1 amazonaws com 52 95 35 53 443  2017 11 24t00 15 54 943  debug  c a h i c sdkhttpclient   attempt 1 to execute request  2017 11 24t00 15 55 773  debug  c a h i c sdkhttpclient   connection can be kept alive for 60000 milliseconds  2017 11 24t00 15 55 773  debug  c a requestid   x amzn requestid  not available  2017 11 24t00 15 55 776  debug  c a request   received successful response  200  aws request id   redact   2017 11 24t00 15 55 776  debug  c a requestid   aws request id   redact   2017 11 24t00 16 57 030  debug  c a i sdksslsocket   shutting down output of ec2 ap southeast 1 amazonaws com 52 95 35 53 443  2017 11 24t00 16 57 030  debug  c a i sdksslsocket   closing ec2 ap southeast 1 amazonaws com 52 95 35 53 443  2017 11 24t00 36 55 779  info   o e d z zendiscovery    i 0b936b3cd7915556b  failed to send join request to master   i 0b11f1ba51dd23d16  qpwg5zuutxkr1eju _ihtw  gmwvbimts7iedcilxekeaw  10 10 2 175  10 10 2 175 9300  instance_type i3 8xlarge  instance_ip 10 10 2 175    reason  elasticsearchtimeoutexception java util concurrent timeoutexception  timeout waiting for task    nested  timeoutexception timeout waiting for task     
the use case i'm attempting is a slightly unorthodox use of elastic  but i believe it's a valid one  i have tags on a document that are tokenized and indexed  but also have vote counts  i'm providing a search facility for these tags that utilise the vote count number to retrieve documents that have higher vote counts than other documents tagged with the same tag  i achieved this using lucene locally  by writing my own duplicating token filter and feeding each term through n number of times  where n is the vote count  i'm able to do a similar thing with elastic where i'd pre filter the token stream by duplicating the tokens in the request i send to elastic  this obviously won't work well for high values of n  so it's a temporary solution  in fact  i just used the whitespace tokenizer with lucene which i fed into the aforementioned token filter   there's no real text analysis required for my usage as i'm storing and indexing the tags verbatim  i just want the tf idf ranking  thanks for listening 
yes  it completely helps     thx  for those who are in docker land and want to see how i overcame it  i use the following assets to build my es json logging docker image 
 atorok it wasn't in my to do list but i have nothing against picking it up  it _feels_ the build label was appropriate since this was running fine before #40564 or #40804 which makes me think something in there changed how system properties are passed   i could be wrong though  i'll know more once i look into it  i would appreciate it though if you have any quick ideas on what in these aforementioned prs have changed the way system properties are picked up
hi dadoonet  i'm newbie to this elastic search  i have not created any analyzer  i just created chinese store in my magento website and triggered reindex  i could see the chinese document cluster in elastic search dashboard  during this reindex i could see this error message in elastic search log  fyi  im having english   japanese store configured in my website and both don't have any issues and it was not done by me

thanks for the quick feedback jimczi  as most of our fields are indeed keywords  "not analyzed"  this could solve the issue  but it must work directly from the kibana search bar  and not only as an optional flag when working directly with elastic  when is this feature planned to be released  and just to i understand   is this something that needs to be added to each field in each index in the mapping  or is it a general configuration 
i checked the issue  this was my mistake to compile the wrong code branch
 tlrx   apologies for my delay in getting back to you here  the snapshot had been running for many days before i attempted deleting it and or restarting the cluster  is there anything i can do to force the removal of this aborted snapshot attempt  thanks
scope creep may be the incorrect phrase here since we haven't really defined the complete scope of the work  only the outcome  i called it out explicitly so we when the work is planned we correctly assess the amount of work needed  if any  to address bwc fwc concerns that come from the decoupling 
the problem is with the mapping it creates  does not seem right and if you try a more complicated example it will error out  example from the docs creates this mapping

will do  thanks  https   github com elastic beats issues 7742
the steps are all that you need to do   the dc txt file is attached to the first issue you don't have to _do_ anything   the errors appear in the logs about a minute after the node starts
yes  jasontedor   i have opened an issue   https   discuss elastic co t elastic search 6 4 0 test case execution failed due to an exception 146615 seems it is not an issue with java gradle version as mentioned in https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 28601#issuecomment 365242949   but the strange thing is i am getting the issue with v6 4 0 only whereas v6 3 2 tcs are getting executed on the same vm with same settings  it would be helpful for us if you provide the exact steps you are following to build and execute test suit in your ci 
thanks  we had been diagnosing the issue coming directly from internal installed plugin that had has caused the netty ssl tls connectivity problem 
the use case   situation here was as follows  1  create an index including corresponding index template and ilm 2  index data 3  realize that the index mappings within the index template need modification 4  modify index template 5  run rollover   _roller   to force the creation of a new index that uses the new mappings 6  expect ilm to work just as it did before  which failed  is there a possibility to make the "ilm skip rollover behaviour" configurable  should we have handled the above situation differently 
my case is a little specific  i have a query with dozens of aggregations  some of them are really nested  then  on application level we need to read elastic raw response  json  and marshal it to a struct  to simplify this thing we did a trick  for every metric that we need   we will have  1  real aggregation  may be really deep nested  2  "public" aggregation   that is top level and just uses  bucket script  to direct to its real aggregation value why strings are needed    because some metrics can return not numeric result  but the value result   i provide here two examples  1  simple example  the most used term 2  complex example  some of our metrics   are histograms     key a count 100   key b count 200        it's might be a result of  terms  aggregation  but we use  scriptedmetric   because sometimes  a  logic is behind just a  termsaggregation   and  b  we can jsonify the result as a simple string  so  yes  i want to perform a some kind of  terms  aggregation  and the list of buckets it returns   are jsonified in a string  and i want it to be available as top level aggregation  via bucket script 
 jdconrad yeah  sorry  mix up repo   ok  i'm re submit this issue to the kibana repository  edit comment   link to re submit this issue  https   github com elastic kibana issues 33402 
i’d love a 400 level error if some requests fail  a configuration option to respond 400 or 200 would be great  errors should fail fast and loudly  silent failure is the worst  the tool i’m using only cares about the http status code  like a lot of tools

 jasontedor when i create a search request and execute queries  for example   searchrequest searchrequest   new searchrequest "indexname"   searchsourcebuilder searchsourcebuilder   new searchsourcebuilder    searchsourcebuilder query querybuilders matchallquery     searchrequest source searchsourcebuilder   searchresponse searchresponse   client search searchrequest  requestoptions default   searchhits hits   searchresponse gethits    searchhit   searchhits   hits gethits    for  searchhit hit   searchhits    system out println "response " + hit      this search request of matchallquery give me a response of   response   "_index"   "indexname"  "_type"   "doc"  "_id"   "1022557"  "_score"   1 0  "_source"     "type"   "databaselog"  " timestamp"   "2019 05 24t11 11 42 393z"  "currtime"   "2019 05 23t17 01 34 000z"  " version"   "1"      in the response of search request  timestamp and currtime are date type of fields and they are received in utc time zone  so  i am suggesting to make user to specify the timezone of the date type fields in the response  for example  if i want all the date type fields in the response hits to show in utc+5 30 time zone  all the date type fields should automatically change to the utc+5 30 time zone 
i don't know if this is the correct setting but i tried setting different locales with the following jvm parameters  "es_java_opts  duser country us  duser language en" and "es_java_opts  duser country de  duser language de" both configurations throw mapper_parsing_exception
here are the mappings 
i'm personally a heavy script user and my usage patterns certainly shouldn't be taken as representative    but for the purposes of discussion  my uses of scripts include    formatting and transforming fields in kibana using the script field functionality   _ unclear to what extent cache is needed for this scenario     eg if i create a visualization and share the link  a cache is one way of handling the resulting spike  is the shard request the right cache for that  _   similarly  i use a spreadsheet connector  https   github com alex at home elasticsearch sheets  which lets   encourages   you to create script fields and scripts for queries and aggregations  and build quite complex transforms between the source data and the spreadsheet's cell range using the  scripted_metric  aggregation    _ obviously a random app i built isn't evidence of any requirement though  the case of caching would be similar to the kibana one  ie sharing a link to lots of people _   an aggregation i use somewhat commonly involves having a fairly frequently changing  or user entered  table of weights  and then using that lookup table to weight the results of a terms aggregation    this is actually the thing i was experimenting with the performance of when i came upon the out of date documentation and starting asking around  so it could be summarized as a mix of "missing aggregation features"   related  "trading off performance to provide  query time  flexibility"  and to a lesser extent "trading off performance to keep all logic in one place" in all cases i'm not so much trading off "correctness for performance" with cache  i'm trading off memory for performance  based on the knowledge expectation that there will be a large number of queries with the same results in a given time period 
the stack trace above is from mvn  mvnw  clean install  6 8 7 fails  6 8 6 passes  no other changes  6 8 7 should pass a mvnw clean install test  no 
unfortunately with chef the install resource showed completing successfully with version 7 6 1  but didn't actually upgrade the rpm to the latest version  confirmed in logs ui after chef run had finished  as well as with an  rpm  qa    i haven't seen this behavior before but it was easily reproduced in all our environments  i didn't get to the point of running it with a debug log level to see if it was just ignoring errors or what  but i'll try to find time to do this 
pretty sure i used master  however  i tried to clone again and then i received an error saying i needed to update to gradle 6 3  i upgraded  and then the build went fine 
you are right  i do not know how but 2 days ago it was not working for some reason  but it of course works  sorry for that

i'm sorry  didn't realize it was georestricted  can you see this  http   www tv2 no v 919547  i get the same fault on this video  just the first little second has audio  then it's silent for the rest of the video  the following have worked just fine  http   www tv2 no v 919193  http   www tv2 no v 916509  thank you 
no  there is a pop up requesting me to sign in with a certain my cable provider  i live in uk and so can not complete the form  this has not been an issue in previous video downloads  trying older videos in the browser present me with "video format or mme type is not supported"  maybe this is an issue with their website  
do not worry and sorry for the hassle  i'll look into it 
i mainly use a software called icaros which enables mkv files showing thumbnails in windows explorer using the thumbnail inside the file or  if there is no thumbnail inside it  using a generated one  but i see the same thing with windows media player and vlc media player  the correct thumbnail from youtube is only correctly displayed for the file where i used   write thumbnail to download the thumbnail and mkvpropedit to embed the thumbnail  for the file where i used the   embed thumbnail option to download and embed it directly  either no thumbnail is being displayed or one is generated from the video    screenshot  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 21064133 17974159 3cfaafcc 6ae5 11e6 92ab 8f1a4b399a90 png 
that fork fixed the problem  thanks phihag

hi philipp  hmmm  i was trying to debug it on this end  i'll send you as much info as i can  may not be today but i'll get around to it  i'm wondering is there an internal undocumented debug switch i can enable when running this  i've run a number of things on this end  i've included a log file of the most recent run  i've run youtube dl begining from the first video and excluding all german videos via the following command    youtube dl   verbose  t   reject title ' de '   playlist start 1 https   www youtube com playlist list plwp_siacdui0kvebt0mu9apz359a4ubsc   tee youtube dl log i then tried the download begining with the offending deleted video number 34  of course i get the same traceback on the same line 228  i then attempted to view that video in firefox 18 0 1 with a slew of addons  i receive the warning from youtube indicating that the video is no longer available and then i'm redirected to the next video in the sequence  hmm  i'm wondering if that might be the issue  this is the url of the playlist  https   www youtube com playlist list plwp_siacdui0kvebt0mu9apz359a4ubsc i've attached two files  the first is the log of the full run of youtube dl  the second file of time 1154 is of a number of tests specifiying various ranges around the deleted video  some interesting results were displayed  the numbering sequence seems to be off  for example lightning talks 1 should be video 33  hope this helps  thank you  regards  lou on fri  jan 25  2013 at 10 58 am  philipp hagemeister   notifications github com  wrote 
all following commands  and then the same traceback as posted above  source for  streamvid  as seen in the first post is available  here  https   github com simukis sysconf blob f072892774559946c3665f39a4dce87f0825403b home config fish config fish#l42 54  
it looks like there are two other examples that have been discussed here  that throw that error  but i suppose nobody has resolved them yet or at least  not to the level where i can download my one  i'm using the latest youtube dl py so i guess it hasn't been resolved yet  here are two others people have run into the issue with  i tried them and both give the same error for me too  http   www youtube com watch v hojtbnibaji https   github com rg3 youtube dl issues 655 http   www youtube com watch v xojtmxuw0s0 https   github com rg3 youtube dl issues 343
hi  sorry for being off the radar     thx for getting back to me  to answer your questions  since both python 2 4   2 6 have been installed on the system that i use  and  usr bin python is 2 4  i made the following chg in the youtube dl  so it would use python2 6  i e  the first line in the script is #  usr bin env  usr bin python2 6 perhaps the above change is necessary but not sufficient  hence causing the error  let me know if i need to mk any other adjustments  thx danesh
yes    restrict filenames  works  it helps by stripping the "bad characters" and not by fixing their encoding 
hello there  apparently my system's locale was not set correctly  once sys getfilesystemencoding   returned utf 8  everything was fine  thanks

looks good to me on python 3 4 ubuntu  i don't intend to test python 2 because as far as i'm concerned it's there purely for backwards compatibility 
hi i need more tests but i use ytdl an ytdl getinfos return this error in my code ill try with ytdl core later today brb thanks le 19 août 2014 à 01 09  philipp hagemeister notifications github com a écrit  
sorry  i can't find anything that's sfw  but here's an example of url  nsfw   http   www handjobhub com video busty blonde siri tit fuck while wank 6313 html here's the video url  http   media2 handjobhub com 8080 videos 5 1 2 3 e 5123ea6d5e5a7 mp4 you can find it easily inside the source code  so it shouldn't be too hard 
i am able to watch the videos fine  either with an ad before or not  though i am in australia  so i don't have any geo blocking  again  if you need access to a server in australia  cli only   i can get you that for testing 
here is an example of video embedded in a "news" article in "jornal nacional" section program on globo website  http   g1 globo com jornal nacional noticia 2014 09 novidade na fiscalizacao de bagagem pela receita provoca discussoes html but in reality you can see almost any video available in one place  globotv globo com  example for the same video from first link  http   globotv globo com rede globo jornal nacional t edicoes v receita federal explica como vai fiscalizar bagagens de quem retorna ao brasil de aviao 3652183  then i guess it's better to just support globotv globo com     links  "what video should be downloaded " not sure what you mean here  for the quality  the best possible for sure  720p

i just tried the link again and worked fine  thanks for following up 
 phihag  aha  thanks  i suspected it had to to with the sharp s   you're right  it must be because it is a restricted video  i didn't notice it  but it does say  « the following content has been identified by the youtube community as being potentially offensive or graphic  viewer discretion is advised  » as for    max quality 1080p    i must confess  i did not read the documentation  i do beg my pard   
maybe my openssl is too old  after using wget as third in my previous post   usr local bin youtube dl file was empty  nothing in it   so i thought i must go again to 2016 04 24  so i have already used curl whithout  k options first  
oh  i didn't realize  bestvideo+bestaudio  include dash streams  the thing is  i wrote the script over a year ago  i believe   when youtube first dropped 1080p in non dash format  i only did some monkey patching later to keep up with format changes  but never carefully read the change log  i suppose the  bestvideo    bestaudio  feature was added later or extended to dash streams later   in fact  iirc ffmpeg merging was also introduced later  which i somehow picked up — i was manually calling ffmpeg before that   anyway  there are still two things my script does that   f bestvideo+bestaudio  doesn't support out of the box    my script prints the format codes and descriptions of the downloaded streams    my script checks for 60fps streams with lower resolution  currently 60fps is only supported up to 1080p  so there are a lot of cases where the highest resolution is for instance 2160p 30  while the video is also available at 1080p 60  and i want to download both  as 60fps is in many cases much smoother

i don't think that's it  i updated from 02 02 2015 when i saw the bug  currently have youtube dl  2015 02 06  net  installed 
yes seems to work fine now   thanks for looking into it so quickly 
sure  link to the dump file i got is the following  https   transfer sh ubq7n out dump trace also included for interest and incase it helps 
because i want to edit the   max connection server    under the external py to actually use my connection in a meaningful way  since there is no way to argument with aria2 using the   external downloader argument in ydl 
in browser video works 
 yan12125 thanks for the response  this is what i get when entering that in  root nicks kali  # python   version python 2 7 9 edit  oh it looks like its working now  just did a reboot and reinstall  thanks 
i can if i log in as it is a private video  i tried using  u and  p option without luck  i guess extracting a private video is not supported  am i wrong  
either one of those would work  but i guess lets go with the write every time a video downloads option  thanks ## john lage

united states and canada  looking at crunchyroll py  it seems like to me that crunchroll playlist doesn't do any logging in when it tries to look up the information so it is unable to get the info because you have to be logged in to view it  when viewing it in a browser 
no  
192 168 1 3 is dummy ip address i am running youtube dl on a web server a want to change the ip address to client ip address using   source address  but it giving me above error no issue with regular video but with dashed videos
i'll give it a shot as soon as the server stops being broken and failing to respond when i try to download it 
not without a proxy and i've tried setting up a proxy for youtube dl too and it doesn't work  but my brother who uses the same isp can download youtube videos even without proxy  i could do it before too but now i can't

i used a default setting in     config youtube dl config  which downloaded best quality automatically  but i didn't get what you mentioned about that video id  for other websites i copied the address everything works fine  even few days ago pornhub is operational as well  i was thinking some protocol changed on pornhub 
yes  i can  this exact error happends regardless whether i supply twitch credentials or not 
that's great  but youtube dl like a lot of programs  strives to have the "best quality defaults" as it even says in the readme of course  i'm more arguing for fullness here  rather than reporting a problem  however  in messing around with some conditional passes  i can't seem to get youtube dl to grab anything with opus without specifically  f x where x is the format code  for example  i tried even what yan12125 stated above  but it did nothing  if i added a "best" failsafe  then it would give me vorbis  but  it wasn't until i put  f 251 that i could get the program to grab an opus file

thanks for your replies  i'll explain what's missing   yan12125   any youtube video  phihag   while replying to your message i went back and took a close look at the arguments and output  i found the issue and it was due to the command that i was running for a longtime and it seems as though the new update changed how _  youtube skip dash manifest_ works as some of the format titles were hidden  either way  the problem was solved simply by removing _  youtube skip dash manifest_ from the good old command that i've been using for a while to get my videos  sorry for wasting your time  again  the new update changed the behavior of command that i was using

i'm still investigating the proxy vpn issue  and suspect it is indeed broken  gopsux  just fyi  even while get_iplayer was non functional i used youtube dl to download a program successfully   the url given in this bug report   i can't try your command line right now because i'm on the machine that can't be put on whole machine vpn  and my proxy vpn appears to be broken at the moment  did you try it without the specific  f format 
just tested it again and it seems to be working for me now  i'll start using it in my scripts  thanks on sun  may 1  2016 at 8 59 am  sergey m  notifications github com wrote

yes  thank you  i searched but with "stream" too many issues came up  thank you
yes  i downloaded the youtube dl exe and place it in  windows system32 i also tried running cmd in admin privilege but getting the same
 trox1972 no  'null' is a character special file  not a directory  so youtube dl tries to create " dev null  f264"
thanks  remitamine  it works perfectly now   
if you mean that particular video  i'm able to access it in the uk and i believe that it is accessible throughout europe and north america  this issue should apply to any video on limelight with ttml subtitles though 
i use the format 95 which is 720p like this   mpv   ytdl format 95 https   www youtube com watch v a8a1nvzhftc i think it may be an issue with mpv because it plays fine on livestreamer 
yes it does  and when i use older releases of youtube dl it work fine 
yes got it  it may be internet connection because now its working fine  not using any proxy 
yes i'm able to watch it on browser without any problem
i'm sorry  slackware 13   linux 3 18 25   i will try to upgrade python

i'm having trouble finding the information i read earlier  i will keep looking  i do know of another way to do it if the audio is piped to mp3gain and the following is ran   mp3gain  r  t   mp3 
the video works just fine in the browser for me  well now  i was able to get the url using  youtube dl  g  but it returned  warning  unable to download webpage   errno 104  connection reset by peer  before returning the video url  after that when i attempt to get the thumbnail  it is failing again  output below   also  below that is the output you requested  i use youtube dl often at this site and it has never happened before but maybe the host server doesn't like me accessing the same page in a short time span  but i'm still able to watch the video just after receiving that error  so i'm still not sure 
heya  ive tested your releases and still no luck  also checked on another win7 x64 machine  same error

tried command w3m www soundcloud com and yep   my vps seems to be banned  question is  if i buy a new vps  how to avoid being banned once again by sc  maybe i need to parse http headers with my commands to sc 
thanks for pointing out causes 
yes  i can watch it in the browser  tested on firefox  as well as download from the url  i have tried both download and embed urls with youtube dl and end up with the same exception 
my server is located in france in an online datacenter  i use a surfshark proxy to solve this issue
openssl 1 1 1d 10 sep 2019 however if i try  python  c "import ssl  print ssl openssl_version "  i get  openssl 0 9 8zg 14 july 2015 
this issue depends not on cdn  we were also able to reproduce it locally
it’s a feature to be honest  the problem is that i’m importing a starter that we have and i need to put an interceptor in the middle of those and since interceptors don’t honor   order  in sb 1 x i can’t do this without doing nasty things 
thank you for the response  both getbean class    getbean string  methods are showing performance degradations  we badly need a work around for this issue  as it is taking more than 3 min during initialization 
this is an empty spring boot application with one dependency on  org springframework boot spring boot starter web  and no other custom beans except one controller with one method  i not remember exact spring boot version  but it is between 2 1 3 and 2 1 6 i think  spring 5 1 8 release

if  null  is provided  then the annotation introspector in the underlying  basesettings  will have a  null  introspector  this would probably lead to  nullpointerexception  at runtime  it would be better to check that the annotation introspector is not null when set in the  jackson2objectmapperbuilder  
i have multiple java modules  spring boot projects   some of them depend on others module  called extension in hybris platform   each have it's own spring configuration  beans config  mvc config       
i was thinking mainly lifecycle related classes   beanfactorypostprocessor    beanpostprocessor    initializingbean   etc  also  it would be nice that   order  and  ordered  have list of classes that will be applied ordering  thanks 
 rstoyanchev thaks your first suggestion of mockmvc perform sc    request  andexpect status   is httpstatus ok value       does work  the functional programming slipped my mind here  also yes you are correct my initial concern here was the forcing of all arguments to be broader  generally with a lot of these frameworks use you use a broader matcher for one argument you are forced to for the remaining arguments in a mocked call  that may not matter so much for an object like a request i suppose but say for instance like a string    there should never be a need for a broader matcher on an object like that  anyways i can use this suggestion  thanks for your time 
 rstoyanchev what do you mean  this is my configuration is s not error
no  we actually tried with 5 1 as well and the behaviour is the same as with 5 2 1 
hello  rstoyanchev thank you for your suggestion  i modified my reproduce with using  httpcomponentsclienthttprequestfactory  instead of  simpleclienthttprequestfactory  as below  then it works as expected   thanks  please close this issue 
it is easier for me to explain by example as i am not fluent in common nomenclature  leets have for example following dto  now i would like to use such dto in the same manner i could use it when it was in javabean form  in javabean example  matching  as far as i am aware  is done by setter name   argument name matching  here  it could be done using builder methods  unless   it is already working like that because i didnt try to do this using builder class as argument 
shadows priest worth nothing without those skills they lose too much dmg and too much hit
now it is right

every kind of small pet like the mini xt 002   cats and so on
 jackpoz as i said this is generic bug so doesn't matter which bosses and spells you want to escape list  there are a lot more but i only have test them
 shauren zlib 1 2 3 29 el6 x86_64
i didn't script this so i don't know the reason of this choice
 jackpoz no  this crash doesn't happen every night  but happen at near 5 or 6 am
as i personally know  to enable crashlog i need to enable debug mode which makes the server completely unplayable with players  cause of lags 
thanks for the follow up  i need to test this myself  i have only just applied the query to my db      edit  interesting that you commented about  unit_flag  67108864  65536k or 64m   http   collab kpsn org display tc creature_template#creature_template unit_flags   unit_flag   hex value   name   comments                               67108864   0x0400 0000   unit_flag_skinnable        because none of the critters   type   8  in tdb 355 60 has got that flag at all  the only critter in the db with high enough flag value to be able to contain 64m is entry 33308  crystalsong oak  2147745792   the flag 2147745792 contains 2147483648  unit_flag_unk_31  + 262144  unit_flag_stunned   perhaps it was originally intended to make all critters unskinnable  but  skinloot    0 seems to bug it 
not    
this spell art of war activated by attack mele weapon or use by spells  free chance 100      fast to fast used    activates with any attack  weapon or spells  so they report that the paladin class is very strong   players  my bad report  cry

not sure  yesterday i played icc 10 and everything went fine  today icc 25 and these bosses are immune to diseases  can't post information you request because i dont own server  i play on the server which is regulary updated with tc and tdb  on daily basis  so i guess tdb 335 11 41 tc hash 9be16be7b355ae95d4d2
tested with a mage 2 fast charges 1 by 1  immune  tested with a shaman  got both stuns  one was slower  dr  tested with another warrior  dr worked  tested with a priest  dr was fine  its only with mages edit 1  i might've accidently closed the issue while commenting 
clean tc and tdb  i have never even touched this whole encounter 
what do you mean 
spirit does not disappear  1 hit  1 kill 
yes i did  and it still occours  its on ubuntu btw
nope appears to happend with others as well  just didnt notice it until i was at that quest  ebon blade knight will fight nearby enemies if they come near  but he will not follow me after combat has ended 
no  its an old bug 
i'm tested and summon  but i don't know if the correct operation
i just think the npcs and gobs of map 609 should be added to spawn_group like here  https   github com trinitycore trinitycore commit 59db2eeea0a35028779fd76372ae06cc98c8086f#commitcomment 24190179
yeah  i do    what exactly should i look for  i didn't notice any "dangerous" change there
yeah i think  but how fixed  
nope only one  now running good the core
sorry for this mistake  it's not "hot strik" but "hot streak"  a fire mage spell http   www wowwiki com hot_streak
i'm sorry for reporting this  it's my mistake  today i'm very tired   
the last revision   and after 97a5db6 maybe directly connected to the application of the ebon plague and not the glyph  edit  even if we try to reapply manually the ebon plague  it doesn't refresh 
as i said  posting single items  through the default ui  works just fine 
it is english
full arena season 8 set  mage wrathfull   but even with less item or more item level you and your vehicle hp should not definitelly be less when enter
no i'm not in raid group    first one of my players told me that that quest wasn't working i asked him are you in raid   and he was not in raid    i was farming for it in hours and noup   
i was searching but nothing
"shouldn't the oozes also despawn  just wondering     " he does it 
you know what's weird   d it works today and no one touched it 
dduarte most of those errors are nothing you can fix  they are actually more like warnings of players trying to do things they are not supposed to do  its something normal that happens all the time  but yet flood the console with an insane number of messages

last merge was https   github com trinitycore trinitycore commit 210a770958c19ea4a881b77c78ca96624aaddc12   no changes done to these spell scripts   only merges of trinitycore  how i say    possible that's only on my site  that's the reason why i ask whether someone else have noticed this 
i was told they can't be used together  that is the correct npc for the quest  not certain if they are spawned only during the achievement or not  but atm i can't limit the heavily perfumed spell cast only for the events duration so i made them event spawnable  unfortunately from what i have as information the ones used for the alliance version of the quest are already a world spawnable and unless i can find a way to trigger the heavily perfumed spell cast only during the love is in the air event i don't have any idea how to fix the quest for them  p s  i do believe that 31416 are also supposed to be world spawns but some of the coordinates i have for them are duplicating coordinates for the 3296 npcs with the same name

 amit86  i agree that even vmaps3 didn't have it working 100  but it was better than it is now  with older revisions my pet at least didn't jump into the water in the canals in stormwind 
i closed it because i submitted the fix as a patch instead of a pull request  patches don't usually end up merged so there's no reason to leave it hanging open

no  as i said in main post i only tested on a fork  but the logic in the if statement looks the same on tc and on the fork  if it is the same  then the bug also exists on tc  i tested on diffchecker com and the logic is the same on both sources  i also confirmed by debugging that the bug is in that if statement 
no  but i just think it's caused by quest item without target
gossip_menu_id is 0 and script name is empty
simple because i don't know how to do that so that people here are satisfied  and git is my personal enemy 
nope  windows 7
sorry if my report wasn’t clear  i did read the github source code master to ensure the bug was still present before reporting it  and my core had been recently updated  since i was reporting a specific error in the logic of a function  probably dating from 2010  i didn’t include any build db info  i apologize for the breach of protocol  from my server log of my local fixed version  using ssl version  openssl 1 0 1e 11 feb 2013  library  openssl 1 0 1e 11 feb 2013  using ace version  6 1 4 trinitycore rev  cb237a4bc277+ 2014 02 13 23 16 49 +0100  master branch   win32  release   worldserver daemon  i’ll point out the general flaw in the logic of the function  then give a specific example of how this gives an error in the game  even if the error in the game is masked fixed elsewhere  given this is the root cause  it should be fixed here as well to prevent future errors  in the file src server game entities item itemprototype h  last edited december 2013  there is a flaw in the logic of the function getitemlevelincludingquality    as a rule  itemlevel should never be   0  this function assumes it can always subtract 13 from an itemlevel and still have a number   0  clearly this is not true for low level items  such as starting gear  current game impact  one example   if you want to queue for a dungeon  it calculates gear locks based on average itemlevel when you log in or go up a level  therefore if have any really low level gear  less than ilevel 13  you’ll have problems  this behavior has been noted in retired bug report 11095 in the comments dated early february 2014  since this behavior has nothing to do with the original bug 11095  or its fix  this issue has been entered to address it  how to reproduce  create a new character  level it to 15  try to queue for a dungeon  they are all locked out based on the gear level being too low  however there are no gear level requirements for low level dungeons  fix analysis  while it is possible to fix this error in the  currently only  caller of the function  player cpp float player  getaverageitemlevel     better form would be to fix it in getitemlevelincludingquality   itself  getitemlevelincludingquality   is currently called when figuring out dungeon locks and when figuring out vehicle scaling  both of which are based on the average itemlevel of your gear  i’m not educated enough as to the reasons why it needs to take into account quality as a separate measure rather than just stick with itemlevel  ideally  we could just drop this function as the impact seems minor  but assuming it is required then   ideally we’d add to the itemlevel rather than subtract from it  however  this would be a much bigger impact to the existing code  specifically vehicle scaling  and the db values for minimum gear level  someone with more experience than me would need to make the call if this is worth it  so for quick fix  minimal impact  and dealing with the root cause i propose putting in a hard lower limit on itemvalue  my suggestion in the original bug report is a hard limit of 0 by changing the return statement to be   however as i’ve never contributed to this project  i leave it up to those more experienced as to if how to proceed

after i used “ cheat cooldown” command  the spell 60192 works fine  it can triggered spell 60202 
as far as i know he should stand infront of the ramp that he comes down from  when you wipe thats his home spot 
debian wheezy 7 0 64 bit system gcc 4 7
built release with tdb 052 form forum and all update sqls from same release mentioned above 
crash occur and we dont know exactly what happend  with a log we discover that is removing m_modauras aura with type 131  but cant reproduce it  no custom code atm
 golrag  its not that easy  im not duscussing armor damage mitigation  im referring to proper weapon damage result  and there are far more formulas involved    ariel  indeed  drdamage takes into account both of them  also armor penetration 
this sql is needed to make the mitigation system work properly
#22848      outdated since 8 1 5 bruteforce has all the data too  but you can also apply mdx7 and then this 
hang on i think i copied it wrong  it's 015bc75 issue has been updated
not sure that is it  i posted this bug when i was leveling in elwynn forest  and i cannot find any low level extra attack spells on the pally at lvl  10 +     "reckoning" is a mid tier tank spell  could this be related to parry and swing time reductions in any way  i'm intermediate at c++  but finding the relevant code is quite a chore when you haven't really been working on it from the get go

no error  latest  current  revision  it just stands arround and does nothing    
no  the level 255 does not affect this bug  i only used the gm 255 to make this video so i could hurry  but the first time i did it with 5 non gm 80 players
perhaps this is a dumb question but could it be anything to do with this commit  d28b66bca88de621fd00495e4edc7e4d9d01e7eb

you are right i went to eastern plaguewands zone139  and blackwood lake  area 2624   " pi" and " gps" command showed the area number and name   go xyz 4244 6  2731 4 6 1 0 0  quel'thalas cords  so as you said it is just when area and zone are the same 
yes i did  do you have a working sql i can try 
sorry  it's latest revision   b0a805c0316a8fe7baf36d06a9ad47f0d51cdfdd with only minor modifications  adding log to track connection sequence since i had the problem  port are both ok  i've tested both instanceport and serverport every of them are ok 
 jackpoz warning is  smartaimgr  entry 24120 sourcetype 0 event 0 action 33 kill credit  there is a killcredit spell for creatureentry 24121  spellid  43138 effect  0  i think it's essentially just saying there is a spell to do this for you  which we know   aokromes sorry  i thought the correction for these went in a new issue that was closed  didn't know it should go to an existing issue 
 killyana  rushor inhabittype is 3 should i change it 
your commit fix the issue   
i suppose the problem is the same  but i'm not sure  so i created an issue for quest 
 aokromes  i am using the same gcc that i used on my pc to build the same core     dduarte 
i'm used last rev source code  not custom mods   i'm used last extractors in wow  
to me  it looks the same as before
i thought with the new updates would do this quest  more as i understand it does not work like that  let's hope who can fix this quest and share in it 
russian and english
 tkrokli yes thank you  it's that because i've just pulled until it was available the branch   killyana in this case it does  because the behavior is the same  i've killed her "normally" and with " die"  same result  the elevator starts and it just teleport up and down after the time  i believe  it needs to go from one side to the other  so if it need 24 seconds to go downstairs it will teleport after 24 seconds plus the time needed to be stopped on the "stopframe"  like in shauren's fix is called   dduarte yes  it just teleports with the player on it    it's like it has superspeed really  more than teleport  seems like it takes the update to client  if it needed  don't know if we need to send the information to the client   or anyway the client updates the position  only when it comes to the "stopframe" saved in the gameobject_template

it's a regression  10 1 handles this and the default to_csv in 0 11 doesn't   legacy   true  is just there so no one uses it 
thanks  i wasn't in on that  i think i unceremoniously kicked out numpydoc due to this  https   github com pydata pandas website issues 20 could see no diff at the time  probably explains why sphinx is yelling a lot  the format seems to be harder to parse  that's what i meant by "impedes automation"  because it looks like free text

yes here it is  please see dropbox links at bottom  i went ahead and reinstalled dev to make a little script to make sure it is reproducible  turns out it is after i set the index to another column from a csv read that it begins to rear its head  maybe this way of setting the index isn't best practice  still i get no issues with stable 0 12 when doing it this way  i don't want to store the axis in mongo for space reasons as well as it always being the same   json  https   www dropbox com s hv53rtudac3i9mx pandas_issue_5651 json axis file used for index  https   www dropbox com s 0mas25dv5ua71dn pandas_issue_5651 axis

 jreback      edit  changed   value  into   val_pointer     is this what you mean  
note that the above is run on top of https   github com pydata pandas pull 7768  which already has a fix for encoding  np nan  as   1  if  np nan  is not in levels  in categoricals  the order which is passed in to the index is enough  no sorting necessary   so imo it should return the position of the  np nan   in some other cases this actually happen when i use the internal cython code  e g  in  pandas core categorical _get_codes_for_values   which correctly encodes  np nan  as the position in the levels  but in that case uses a  pyobjecthashtable  instead of a  float64hashtable

i saw that  but that would not be read by someone looking for api changes  am happy to do so  but how does that work given that 0 13 has already been tagged 
yes  that solved it  thx  i guess it should not pick that up for a to_string   operation  as that is not  display   or  well it is  but maybe one needs a different  to_textfile    method that avoids this to be picked up

since each datetime in the index has hour   9  the end date of  04 jan 2014 00 00  isn't included in the index and is in fact strictly less than the last included date  04 jan 2014 09 00  of the returned slice  i e  the returned slice has included a value which is 9 hours after my specified end point  if i had instead specified  04 jan 2014 09 00  as the end point then i would expect the value 3 to be returned because of the inclusive nature of pandas' label based indexing   jreback  surely this is a bug

hi jreback  here's a self contained example 
pandas version  0 11 0 dev 1052f47

versions  pandas  0 13 0  numpy  1 8 0  numexpr  2 2 2  so  i've double checked and it looks like the error appears only if numpy    1 8 and numexpr    2 2 2  works fine with numpy  1 7 1 and numexpr  2 2 2  but numpy   1 8 currently causes other sorts of bugs as you may know   also works fine with numpy  1 8 0 and numexpr  2 3  so what exactly would you put in install rst   note also i'm using anaconda distribution and they currently ship numpy 1 7 1  numexpr 2 2 2 and pandas 0 13 0 for some reason  btw  numexpr 2 3 was released just yesterday 
yes  are there older builds of pandas on python 3 7 1  i suppose i can try newer pandas version on old python 
i think it would be useful  but mainly was checking how difficult it might be to implement 
yeah  it's "fixed" in #2777 in the sense that the get and set behaviors are consistent now  but they still don't make any sense really   
some warnings and errors are only relevant for the programmer  but sometimes the warnings errors will be shown to the end user  so if your software is used by people with different languages  like french and spanish   it's common to have the code throw "this is an error" for english users  but spanish users would see "esto es un error" instead  and french users would see it translated into french  etc  obviously  you can't have a reg ex expression match all the different languages  so you need a system where each error warning has a unique name id  granted  most python programmers would never bother to handle multiple languages in their strings    that's more common in "big  professional" software written in c++ java c#  so i'm not saying internationalization is the major reason we should implement my proposal above  getting internationalization is just a bonus  the real reason we need this feature isn't for internationalization  it's for the issue described on #1893  way at the bottom of the thread

 jorisvandenbossche you are right  i just confirmed this  passing an  engine  object works perfectly well on  master  
i created the multi index one   b_df  as follows    other than that   a_df  and the data in  left_df  and  right_df  comes from sql queries and perhaps a few other joins before that 
looks good with 0 13 0rc1 under python 2 7 6   thank you 
this is correct that after selection the value 3 still in the levels set   in my specific usage i want to know the unique values of levels  of course i can make a set  set  tdf12 index get_level_values 1    so  you say the idea is to keep the whole collection of level labels from the original df  if so there is no bug 
i use winpython 3 3 0  http   code google com p winpython downloads list   i installed visual studio 2010 and can compile pandas successfully  thanks very much for your kind attention 
okay  so make it invalid  i'll admit i don't have a use case for it  it just came up when looking into the implementation of unstack and how to make that sparse  i still think the sparseseries error is inappropriate  on 17 jan 2018 11 40 pm  "jeff reback"  notifications github com  wrote 
sure  here's the small example 
 infer_dst  only works when there are only two dates for the fall dst transition time  if there are more than two  then it cannot infer simply based on order  in that case  something else needs to be done to explicitly tell what times are dst times and what times are not 
 cpcloud re  "parse_dates false"  i don't understand what is going on here then  see column 2 for example  
the biggest use case is in the case of a multiindex where having the labels on the various indexes is very helpful 
yes  in any case  a week has business days  why would shape 0  be 4 and not 5 
yeah  will do when i have some time tomorrow 
not sure  but i posted the same question here  https   github com hdima erlport issues 11
i ran into it originally with  df memory_usage   sum    in an older version of pandas  this doesn't recur in master  still  i would like to be able to depend upon the  msgpack  implementation in pandas for general computations  where this might arise 
this is the keyerror  there was a little bug in the code snippet   i'm using python 2 7     library python 2 7 lib python site packages pandas core indexing pyc in _multi_take self  tup  838 return o reindex   d  839 except      840 raise self _exception 841 842 def _convert_for_reindex self  key  axis 0  
i'm expecting it to call my format function for each value in the column  it doesn't seem to call the formatter at all  obviously  'xxx' format  is a stupid example   but it illustrates that it's not applying the function to the 10 4 value when it occurs in a mixed type column  a more realistic formatter would be something like  lambda x  x if type x  is str else '     0f ' format x   which displays   when i'd expect  10 for the 3rd row

 cpcloud this does the job  i assume it can be merged with the style  i have to give a deeper look  though 
i'm getting data from a json response  this is a list of nested dictionaries which first need to be flatten  i could do this 
 to_csv  returns a string so it could be a string also
yes raising a  valueerror  is more understandable  see http   stackoverflow com questions 18212247 convert text dates to dates and then keeping the na values
i'll have to do so at home  it would be good to know if 0 13 fixes this

i guess that treating  false  and  none  differently would not be a good thing    i understand what you have quoted from the docstring and it makes sense that it would write the label even if  index_label none   if it is intentional that the index_label is written in the 2nd row  then i would consider that a regression  i would say that more important than mimicking the output in the terminal  is to keep consistency  here are two reasons  1  as shown in the first message  it is not possible to read the file in the same manner as it was written  2  when reading a file for instance with  df   pd dataframe from_csv filepath    if the first cell  in the first row  has the value label  then you will have  df index name  equal to label 
 jreback i used the exact data in the stack example to confirm that this was the same problem i have see  http   stackoverflow com questions 21641857 pandas valueerror convert float nan to integer i o csv file

maybe you are talking about a different version  i cannot see any such explanation you suggested in the docstring   in any case  i believe it needs a better doc string  or an a rename even better 
so  say someone has 15 experiments  multindex 1   each with 20 experimental conditions  multindex 2   and they record 100 trials for each condition  columns   the person wants to publish this data  so they need to get the mean and error range for the data  so they need to collapse along condition  getting both the mean and standard error  with this approach  the user could use experiment as index and condition as column  here is a simple example  using a lambda for the implementation    this becomes much more important for more complicated analyses  doing manipulations of data with many level multi indexes becomes much  much harder if you also have to manage a second error table  column  or index  i can give an example for that as well  but it will be longer 
sorry  i pressed submit by mistake  hope it's clear now 
df_pickle pkl is created using pandas 0 14 1  however  the raw data in the pickle file are results of calculations done on data originally stored in hdf5  created with pandas 0 12  
thanks for looking into this  after reporting this i dug a bit into this and also noticed those odd sort columns and so on  so  well  it's not really up to pandas  but indeed part of what there is  on the other hand  if this "table pattern" is indeed very common to wikipedia  it could be worthwhile to implement a "wikipedia" mode to the parser   which is activated automatically for    wikipeida org  urls  … just an idea  it would be cool  that's all  one   up   grinning

    for your second question  with plt plot df index  df test   it works without memory leak but it can show axis as datetime like for df test plot   
i did some more troubleshooting and i found out where the object dtype was being introduced  in my case i'm pd concat  'ing a bunch of csv files and one of them had 0 data rows  the dataframe was being created with columns of dtype object  then when concating it upcasts the float64 columns with nan to object  i can do due diligence to prevent this object upcasting  but i still believe there is a flaw in how agg   works with and without a dictionary specified for these columns  here's a sample csv and ipython notebook output showing the problem  https   www dropbox com s 1238l1m3g4zju4s reproduce csv dl 0 https   www dropbox com s 63k0i0yqxqkr4lh ipython html dl 0

 chris b1 hi  there doesn't seem to be difference in  _is_dates_only  #### 0 24 0  i think it has to do with the chunking  when there's no chunking the speed doesn't vary 
i suppose if the secondary axis is tied to having a legend then the current implementation makes sense  and more documentation warning may help  i agree if there is no legend then there is no explicit way the person viewing the plot knows what is plotted against what  but i guess i wish it was hackable so i could do it anyway and then explain it in the figure description  unfortunately for me  i can't transform the data as it's one of many plots i'll have for a publication and they all need to be the same style  thanks for the help 
i am testing in python 3 5 and 3 6  all outputting the same errors  here you have an example just with one case 
i've looked at my options and all that are related to formatting floats are set to defaults  display chop_threshold is none  display float_format is none  display precision is 7   it seems to be an issue in pandas core format py   working on a fix 
since you clearly know more about pandas than me  it's probably not worth your while asking me questions about it  p apply receives the results from the func  function before it re combines them  doesn't it  i guess the problem is that list items aren't all of one type  couldn't you still do something like  and just pass the error if that fails   sorry  on my phone 
i am not expecting the correlation coefficient to be 0  what i compute in the example above is the p value for the significance of the correlation  and i expect this p value to be 0  the following example calculates the correlation coefficient and the p value for a self correlation   in a way  i am misusing  corr   because i do not compute correlation coefficients  however  i expect that if  corr  takes a generic callable  the result of this callable should be calculated also for the diagonals

hi  thanks for picking this up  yeah  i understand it’s not ideal to have nan in the index  however i wrote a class  actually a number of classes  to do my data evaluation  which need a dataframe of a defined structure in it’s  data property  datapoints always have an index and mostly a timestamp as well  the index is unique  the timestamp not always  but mostly  therefore  i figured it would be generally good to have them both in a multiindex  because if there is timestamp information  i usually use this to select data   in some evaluations i prefer for simplicity to have only one oft he two in the index  therefore the drop_index  which is used internally in a method of one of my classes  i hope this makes some sense without all the context   
so i looked at adding a docstring but the docstrings are currently auto templated from the function name and a pre existing template   so i'm gunna say this is not amenable to a trivial doc only fix  https   github com pandas dev pandas blob master pandas core groupby groupby py#l1346
yes  it was older num_expr 2 4 4  after upgrade to 2 4 6 bug went away thanks a lot 
correct  this bug is fixed on 0 24 2 
read_csv  read_table can do this  however you're hooking into sep field  which serves for how to seperate the values  however some log files do not use a common separator and hence you are injecting regular expression logic on how to read a file and it doesn't handle parameters from a regex 
thank you for your feedback   it put me on the right path  there seems to have been a problem with the mkl library  when i converted my conda install to  nomkl   using openblas instead  the problem disappeared  it must have happened when i did a  conda upgrade   all   updating not only pandas but also mkl  btw  i could plot using kind  'bar'  'barh'  'line'  'hist'  'box'  'pie'   but just not  'kde'  'density'   in the standard python console  i had been using the ipython console up to this point   i got the following error intel mkl fatal error  cannot load libmkl_avx2 so or libmkl_def so

 jorisvandenbossche thanks for pointing that out  it was looking as a duplicate  but i tried it and it doesn't seems to solve the problem 
 jorisvandenbossche using the series  tz_localize  method produced the error message  typeerror  already tz aware  use tz_convert to convert  even though the contained timestamps had no time zone  i was forced to use the   apply       loop to use the individual timestamp  tz_localize  methods  this did confuse me  and wasn't exactly ideal due to the performance hit of using   apply       however  i didn't try to investigate further as the issue described in #10390 meant that i was forced to revert back to pandas ver 0 18 1  as the timezone dropping bug for both series of timedeltas and single timedeltas handily means that the   max axis 1   call completes successfully  the part of code that meant investigating this timestamp behaviour is pretty critical to my app  as it resamples data to a regular time window while also providing me with a measure of how 'complete' that window is  i e  what percentage of the reading for that normalised window is covered by one or more raw data readings   having expected behaviour for this is rather important  but for the moment i'd rather have understood sub optimal behaviour that works  thanks for your attention to these issues   i really do think this is a great library and massively appreciate the work you guys put in  i'm poking around in the source  and will open a pull request if i can figure out the root cause    
are the two pivot_table documentation pages both generated from the same docstring in  pivot py   where shall the "deprecated  use dataframe pivot_table  "  as seen  here  http   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable generated pandas dataframe sort html   go in this case 
 gfyoung yes  would putting a link to a tiny    csv  to my github work 
yes  i would expect hdf5 append to reflect the same behaviour as it has been implemented in pandas in 0 19  with regards to categories concat append  this should not fail  maybe a feature for a future version  cheers jc
ok  i just tried hardcoding the paths and removing all tkinter  now  it writes the data perfectly but it no longer shows the variable  mode  behavior  it repeatedly overwrites the single line of data  but it writes the last set successfully  the example below includes a modified for loop to account for this 
apparently not  when i try to replicate this with randomise data   np random rand   this prints and displays efficiently  this leads me to believe that the bug is caused by a specific issue with my data  i will investigate further   
  my usecase    i work with time series acquired by a field sampler  the sampling rate is approximately evenly spaced  with some variation  instrument failure  etc   the signal may be noisy so i want to apply a rolling mean in order to see the general tendency  doing a average based on the number of point is not a good idea as they can represent a variable time interval  then  i want the rolling mean account for  let's say  the past 2 5 days to the next 2 5 days  one solution may be to do a rolling mean without centering and then shift it  but it only work with regularly space data  see for instance the following dataframe with without the "2010 01 07" day 
that is exactly right  in my case i had a large file   10mb of text  and i tried to understand where it breaks  but i couldn't find it easily due to the misleading error message 
the bug is at this line  data plot kind 'scatter'  color 'blue'  x 'length'  y 'weight'  ax axes 0  title 'original values'  lm_original_plot plot kind 'line'  color 'red'  x 'length'  y 'weight'  ax axes 0   please observe the x axis line  the data is 90  85  80  the sequence is reversed  it suppose to be linear in sequence 
i'm happy to confirm that with pandas 0 21 0 dev+105 g03d44f3 the issue is fixed
i'm actually trying to adapt the code at https   stackoverflow com a 38964596 336001  which recursively adds subtotal rows into a dataframe  to work along columns instead  here is the original code  which adds subtotal rows   this code will produce the "cannot reindex from a duplicate index" error  whereas the original code provided in the stack overflow thread works fine  the minimal working example i've found was just the simplest way to reproduce the error 
 branyang and  tomaugspurger  i have added the stacktrace 
 gfyoung absolutely  see below 
just updated the post  what did you mean by that  it works fine with   ix  after all 
 jreback   '12 30 is the first business day before 1 1 ' issue is the original dataframe does not have 12 30  hence 12 30 is not supposed to be in result when we resample 'b' 
sorry  forgot to attached the csv  added to original post 
unfortunately not  its part of a bigger database sample  the weird observation is that the same accident index in other frames  shown below  works fine  only in this frame  veh_frame  it fails    v1 acc_frame accident_index  acc_frame latitude  51 2537   acc_frame latitude  51 7181   v2 acc_frame accident_index  acc_frame accident_index isin v1 tolist       acc_frame longitude   0 5501   acc_frame longitude  0 2644      also when i tried to trim the list  in order to paste here  to about 10 20 long it works  but when i run it with a list of about 10000 strings it fails  this was not a problem on the previous version

because i want to cache tables to disk  the hash value allows me to check if the current table version is different from the one on disk  thus avoiding large unnecessary writes  while i have you    how do i tell if a column is a dict or other complex type  loading from e g  json just gives me "object" type for every column 
on the values  it does  but i thought having a parameter for this would be elegant 
there is no traceback as no exception is thrown  the process simply crashes  with plain  xldr  or  openpyxl  i can read the file however   the output of  openpyxl  is not correct  it seems it cannot handle the single surrogate   xlrd  is correct 
my bad  i am sorry you had to take time to reply to this  i just found the offending data after combing through the sql out put  on jan 28  2018 00 58  "joris van den bossche"  notifications github com  wrote 
sure  just take the example from the stack overflow link   output  desired  instead of the second line   1 2 3    the  first  line with the comment   #one two three   should be used as the header  the second line should be interpreted as data

i'll see if i have time to do it at some point  this is not a critical issue for me  just thought you might want to know about it  systemerror is a python built in exception  https   docs python org 3 library exceptions html#systemerror
the above code is only a demonstration  in fact i have a couple of timeseries which i want to compare for example by correlation  sometimes these series match better after introducing a time lag  the dataframe is used to store the results  of course it is more a kind of "sugar" and not really necessary  first of all  i was just surprised that the code did not work as expected and it took me while to see that it was not my fault 
yes  it works on  master  as of today  shall i do a pull request with my fix on  0 22 x  
yes i followed the guide but unfortunately i didn't get it to work
 nprad  feel free to pick this up 
 tomaugspurger here my system pandas 0 23 0 output   did the default setting change in 0 23 0 
 willayd yeah  that is the case  i am not mixing the ints and strs together  actually that is the nature of the data  chrom pos ref               scaff_9 1               scaff_9                             2 23                  2 51                       1 11                    1 23                        so  when there is no  scaff_9  grouping happens nicely  when there is  scaff_9  in my input   csv or tab separated file   there is grouping problem with  chrom   2   one small group of  2  and another large group of  2  again  so  it seems that  pandas  interprets  2  as string type because it was reading earlier  chrom  values as string  but later switched to treating 2 as integer  but  what ever be the type of data in  chrom  field it should not treat few  2  as string and other as integer  rite    i am just reading the tab delimited file and doing grouping on the data frame  so i am not changing or specifiying what is in  chrom    pandas should be able to handle it automatically  but  if there is not  scaff_9  in my input data there is again not problem with  groupby   i am saying  the mere presence of  scaff_9  as string type data earlier on the dataframe should not affect  groupby  operations on the rest of the data 
 mgrout81 not appears because is not released on stable branch yet  please check at https   dev pandas io user_guide io html
thanks for the help  it's actually based off of centos 7  i'm an intern at a company which uses a custom python environment that's from the build rather than the dockerfile  i tried to reproduce the issue by creating a new container with a basic dockerfile  and the issue goes away  it must be some system level package interaction issue  will update if i figure out what's causing it 
 jorisvandenbossche i will  thanks 
i use pip  when i try to install 0 23 1 i get the error    microsoft visual c++ 14 0 is required  get it with "microsoft visual c++ build tools"  http   landinghub visualstudio com visual cpp build tools  although i have it installed   
 tomaugspurger i have used  isin  directly  i guess there are some workarounds in place for  series   which catch this corner case  when  series isin       is used   at least i was not able to reproduce this error without much trying  however  to be precise  my example corresponds to   probably  this is the case because      uses  is  at first and only than the equal operator of floats   in your example two different nan objects are created  not very stable approach in anycase though    also  i would prefer to be consistent with the sane pandas float64 behavior than with to some degree irratic python set behavior 
 gfyoung certainly  i've repeated the test with different pandas versions  the issue occurs from pandas version  0 23 0  onwards  in pandas version  0 22 0  all results are still as expected 
my git version is 2 18 and yes  i tried it multiple times  i read that sometimes windows has troubles with non ascii characters and trailing blanks in file names or folder names  but then other windows users would have the issue as well  
i was wrong  it has nothing to do with the dataset i provided  this is a pretty huge bug in pandas imo 
thanks  will take that into account   
updated  thanks 
ah  it's in color  answer in https   github com pandas dev pandas issues 21526#issuecomment 433836945 
there was a problem related to the database which says unable to find the field  i renamed the data frame column name to match the name of the columns in the table  it worked for me 
not sure  haven't needed it myself  but i'm pretty active on answering questions on the pandas tag on so and i see this question quite often  same as  explode  method before introduced in  0 25 0  
my issue is not that their output is wrong  what i was hoping for is that the 1st three merges will generate a warning error telling me that it is not a many to many merge as i specified in  validate 'm m'  and only the 4th merge run with no issue  this will make the behaviour of  validate  consistent in the sense that if i specify a  1 1    1 m    m 1   or  m m   i expect an alert if the data in the joining columns are not that way  currently  the 1st three merges do not generate any alert  having this will save the user some non uniqueness if it is desired  checking 
can you be a little be more precise  i'm not understanding your question  the problem is still existing  my   foo py    when executed on linux machine by   root01   user  generate an   output xlsx   file owned not by   root01    but   root   instead  causing an error in the next parts of foo py  where i need to re load and manipulate this output xlsx data  thanks
 willayd a  e and f do though  why should g be different  either all of them should return something or none of them should  i think it is counterintuitive for a  isin mylist  to return some rows  and  isin mylist +  newel   to return no rows  adding more elements to the list that pandas is matching on should never result in fewer elements being returned  do you know if there is a c subroutine the performs the comparisons or if it's in python 
yes  please do  sedosa

 drew heenan yes you're right i meant   items     have updated the above code snippet  thanks for taking a look at the issue 
what direction would be most useful in sqlalchemy  do you recommend i have the engine execute a "plain" sql statement  or should i create objects in a session 
lists and dictionaries are one dimensional objects as well  and yet when you pass a list of lists to a dataframe  it is interpreted as a 2d object  similarly  lists of series and dicts of series are interpretted as 2d objects  series of list  series of dicts  and series of series are all interpretted as nx1 dimensional objects  i agree that a series is one dimensional  so why does the pandas constructor treat a series passed to it as if it were a two dimensional nx1 object  consider the difference between the following  it seems to me that pandas isn't treating series objects as one dimensional  it is treating them as two dimensional nx1 objects which is just kind of weird to me  maybe i'm the strange one in all this though and its all perfectly intuitive to everyone else 
well  it works for the unequal length of nested containers  why the behavior is different for equal and unequal lengths  try the following   the dataframe is created with no error  i am trying to import dataframe by reading from matlab arrays and then unfolding them for a neural network training etc  matlab arrays they can be complex 
i submitted the issue to jupyter lab first  but they think that it's up to pandas to render the table correctly  https   github com jupyterlab jupyterlab issues 6570#issue 456092602   it looks like some custom formatting for notebooks is provided by pandas  so maybe it would make sense to add it there  https   github com pandas dev pandas blob 77e6556ab55bb2746e1d1bb1f7c3da66bba2a4a1 pandas io formats html py#l525
sure  that'll be my compensation for taking up resources here   
hi tom  yes  that is a fair request  thanks for the link  i tried to reproduce the problem with just code and simple dataframes  but sadly did not succeed in reproducing it that way  i will try some more things and will post an update if i succeed 
 tomaugspurger thanks for your reply  fair enough  would you mind answering the following question then please    what is the official way to perform multiple filtering and manipulation steps  including adding columns  in a function while avoiding the settingwithcopyerror issues then    i have tried using the usual   loc  approach  but that didn't help  i hope the solution isn't to append   copy    to every other manipulation step because i'm typically working with big data frames    not quite  the weakref gets assigned during the construction of the "new"  df1  when performing the first filter operation  and it points to the "original"  df1   later on  in this code section  https   github com pandas dev pandas blob 0 24 x pandas core generic py#l3244 l3248 the gc is called to see if the reference still exists  which it doesn't  as the original  df1  is gone   so no issue  however  in the function call case with  df2  the reference to the original  df2  remains intact because it still lives outside the function  therefore the gc call doesn't remove the link  and the issue arises  so it's not that the "function machinery adds a reference" but rather that there exists a genuine reference from  df2  in  f    to the original  df2  in  main    that survives the gc call  for good reason   i tried changing the last line to   in the hope that the interpreter might realize that the original  df2  reference won't be needed anymore after the function call has ended  but that doesn't work  i have also tried the latest 0 25 0 version which handles reference resolution a bit more smartly  no gc call   but the issue remains the same 
ahh indeed it is   not sure why it didn't come up in the related issues  sorry for the noise 
#### code example  #### i have found the problems  please fix it  the problem happens when the date index is not continuous  in the example above  i delete several row  and the xtick went wrong 
client isn't relevant to the proposal  just copied from my example  i'll make up another example that is minimal 
yes  it's a bunch of functions  i could try and collect those if that would be useful  here's one example     details 
i went through all the changelogs from 0 21 to 0 25 1 but didn't find any mention of it 
good question  no  s3fs+gzip get the same error   so looks like an s3fs issue  i'll close this one  thanks for the help  willayd  
i know this is probably a problem with parquet engine  but it's so obvious that i think there should be an  pandas usage  issue to record it     you can add a tag for this issue  'usage problem' or 'rtfm' i'll try to get the traceback then  before it killed by os 
it is a waste of time to repeat this problem  so submit this problem to increase the weight  when this problem encounters more  please revise it  it should be a python version change  just go back to the original version  and wait for the next version to be good again 复现这个问题太浪费时间了 提交这个问题增加权重 等到这个问题碰到多了 那麻烦在修改下  应该是python版本变动 退回原来版本就好 等下下个版本又好了
that would behave the same  i understand the confusion  the most observable side effect of the problem would be  if i do   def _reduce  cannot be reached
that's weird  it working fine now  must have been some temporary glitch  thanks anyway 
i want to do arduino   php serial communication  but i read that pandas only works with 3 instances but i can't assign to read       screenshot_3  https   user images githubusercontent com 56591520 66930979 cf049000 f00b 11e9 9ccc c7163ef2118d png

 willayd    tomaugspurger exactly same error also hapenned with 0 25 3 as well   jbrockmendel  you are right error was infact rooted in numpy  when i tried to install that  error was clear and indicated that i was missing microsoft vc++ 14  upon installation of which  i was able to install both numpy and pandas  thanks for the all help  i wish pandas installation had not wrapped the dependencies' error message

hi marc  agreed that iterator solves the big file problem  in fact  that's what i have been using  the command line toolbox is just so rich and powerful  and i doubt python has convenient   efficient ways of doing all  just one example  i once got a huge csv file  where one string variable had carriage return characters  this messed up both pandas read_csv and data table  fread  the sed command removed these characters blazing fast at a rate of more than 2gb per second  i totally understand if this may be low on the priority list  but i do believe it would open up a lot of opportunities  especially for those who are already fluent in command line  on tue  nov 12  2019  8 13 pm marc garcia  notifications github com  wrote

 pd read_csv  default  memory_map  seem not to work  if i explicitly set  memory_map  to  false   it work
thanks  but unfortunately no   latin1  is the encoding that was used for the original  sas7bdat  so this is in fact the correct encoding to be used when reading the file to pandas   also   latin1  is just an alias for  iso 8859 1  😉   nevertheless  before submitting the issue i ran a script to check if the issue persists if using any other enconding for reading the data   it does   not sure if it is the case if another encoding is used when writing the original  sas7bdat  file 
i have a different opinion here  so first  i think everyone agrees that there is an inconsistent issue of groupby and sum after grouping by between one column and two columns  and those need to be aligned  the point that we disagree is whether those should be 0 or null  i found that the default behavior of pandas regarding all null column has change since  0 22  https   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable whatsnew v0 22 0 html#arithmetic operations   i am not sure the reason behind that  but one of my colleagues show me the related changes in  numpy nansum  https   docs scipy org doc numpy reference generated numpy nansum html   let's slice this issue a little bit further  first  how  pandas  handles an empty level in a categorical column is treat there is null attach to it  see  here  https   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable reference api pandas categorical html    so when you do group by  you are essentially reduce all  np nan  together and sum on that  what should be the expected return value of a list pandas series with all null  value 0 as the sum means different than null  0 can mean +1 +   1   or 3+2+  5   or other infinite combination of a series that cancel out each other  0 gives user the impression that there is some information and the aggregated results is 0  in the other hand  nan means pandas does not know what the final result should be  15 0 should give null because we don't have a clear answer to this question  if the aggregation action is  count  and all null gives 0  i can understand that  because there is no record  everybody agrees on that  however  summation after group by with 0 gives me the impression that there are stuff there but they happen to cancel each other after aggregation  this is misleading and counter intuitive  in addition  i want to bring up is if you look at  numpy sum   it returns null for array that is all null 
 someting similar to the dataframe method   https   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable reference api pandas dataframe select_dtypes html  anyway  this is just an idea to handle mixing types in object column

hi again  i believe this is what you're asking for 
 jbrockmendel unfortunately i'm not able to reproduce easily at this moment  i left a comment  here  https   github com pandas dev pandas pull 33723#discussion_r413099393  that hopefully sheds some light on the issue 
 tomaugspurger what do you mean by fresh environment and or how do you make the environment fresh 
hi  tomaugspurger   it is not working with pandas 1 0 2  i am getting the same below mentioned error which i was getting earlier 
this comes close  but it lacks the essential functionality to define holidays that occur on dates that are defined relative to the lunar cycle  but i see that pandas basically only provides wrappers for  easter  from  dateutil   so the question arises  is this out of scope for pandas  should this be propagated upstream to dateutil  or do they already have this functionality and it would only require another wrapper 
yes  that works  thanks  tomaugspurger for the quick response 
at  datatofish com  https   datatofish com export pandas dataframe json   there are some nice examples of how to use the various values of the  orient  parameter  and for  orient    'table' they have   the  pandas read_json    documentation should specify which values are supported for the "type" property in the table schema  from the example  i gather that "string" and "integer" are allowed but this is surely not the complete list  also  are there any other constraints apart from the data type that can be specified here  such as min max length for strings etc   when comparing this example  or the one from the  pandas read_json    docu  to the ones at  the "field descriptors" section  http   specs frictionlessdata io table schema #field descriptors  in the "table schema" documentation at "frictionless data specifications" they look very similar  which leads me to suspect that the schema specification for  orient  'table' json input uses the same format  so  in the  pandas read_json    documentation i would expect more specific information about how to use the  orient  'table' input format  in particular   a list of permissible values for the "type" property and   a specification of any additional properties  per "type" value  that are allowed to express further constraints  ps  i don't know docstrings and since i don't know the answers to the above questions  either  i wouldn't know what the docstring should look like 
yes   i solved the problem by downgrading to numpy 1 17 4 with a specific anaconda's environment as explained here   https   discourse jupyter org t osx 10 13 6 kernelrestarter restarting kernel 3965 10
i installed it by  pip install  r requirements txt  where requirements txt includes pandas without specifying the version 
redirect to 404 error page  in this case  http   myhost web app php demo would works  while http   myhost web app php demo  returns 404 error  i hope the url which ends with trailing slash would refer to the one without trailing slash  end users would think the the same url which with or without trailing slash are the same 
yes  this is working in the master branch  sorry about that 
the 2 0  but the problem could also extend to 2 1    in 2 1 'throw new httpexception  422  "   "  ' causes no problem  but in 2 0  dev environment  throws a nasty exception

and sometimes your warmers need some configuration as well  the doctrine warmup needs to know only the server version  all the other parameters as username  host or password are useless  probably i'm arriving a bit late but i have to go trough the issues pr history and see what are the advantages over  database_url  vs  db_   parameters  i see only disadvantages as urlencoding issues with passwords usernames ans coupling  in this case my env file could be just   s458 28 26 3d65 3fw  is the urlencoded  s458   65 w     much les unclear  this could be a solution  but the  env dist  file was not meant to be used in the codebase  is just to help devs to setup their own variables   weaverryan i disagree  env vars are just configurations and the cache warmpup might need configurations too  the  serverversion  probably should not be in the environment variables as most probably the database version is not something that changes so often and cold be hardcoded in the  config yml  file  but because of  database_url   now has to be a single gigant obscure "url"  if a warmer needs configurations why not allow them to have it    edit    ok  i see that the old configurations in the doctrine bundle are still available so the  server_version  can be specified next to the database url  this solves the doctrine warmup but the issue with the env vars defaults is still there
what you propose is actually what the formatter type does  the issue is coming from registered listener with is never call if the listener is attached to the one provided by the formattertype  so the transformation  converting a raw text to the selected format  is never applied  see https   github com sonata project sonataformatterbundle blob master form type formattertype php#l66 l87
well  maybe this is the wrong approach  but what i want to do is to allow to modify existing definitions  right now if a definition already exists  the new definition will replace the existing one  the parent property attribute is good and does exactly what i would need  except that it stores the merged definition under the new id  not the parent id  of course  for what it is intended it is exactly right  so  what i have been doing is to add a convention in that the prefix 'merge ' followed by the parent id indicates to merge the given definition into the parent  works well and with the method being protected so i can call it from a subclass the whole class is about 5 lines long  right now it is almost an exact copy  btw  i've got some other issues with method visibility in the yamlfileloader   would i raise those here or in the trac system  i originally did it in trac  but that doesn't seem to be available any more 
data type is text in sybase and has been ever since  i will test binary and blob  thanks  i am not against either  its just that it is a bc break for me

yeah  my bad 
 bschussek it appears the bug still exists  the error is still mapped to "data 2  break" rather than "data wed  0  break"  or something similar  anything i can do to help you debug

 null    
it occured in the older commit i was using  but not with current master  closing   
after removing  line 277 from  constraint   https   github com symfony symfony blob 09f252a3e20acfdbb69ed5c6d63244f668963795 src symfony component validator constraint php#l277  or the entire  __sleep  function  at least my tests pass  didn't check symfony's suite   can you spot an error there 
okay  my posting might have been a bit misleading  with the current  process  class  i can start a process  but it blocks the main thread  because it sits there and waits for new data to process until it eventually dies after finishing or after timeout  it would be nice to have an api like the  childprocess gem  http   rubydoc info gems childprocess 0 1 9 frames  in ruby 
xaav  i haven't try  but i will  tell you later   
thank you benjamin  but i already try with and without leading slash  and with both ways the uniqueentity constraint class is being executed  it is just that the validatedby   method is not being override and the worst is that uniqueentityvalidator is never being executed called  i concluded that cuase i trhow arbitrary wrong code inside the validatedby method  and remove the uniqueentityvalidator file class 
my deps file is configured to use assetic v1 0 2   asseticbundle v1 0 0 like it is in the master branch of symfony 
thanks  nicolas grekas  
i expect the behaviour to describe as "when i am in   var   how would i cd to   home user "  similarly for the second case  which does answer that question analogously 
for example as it is done in fosuserbundle they extend userinterface and add there getalgorithm method so if encoder takes user as a parameter it will be easy to write custom encoder and that's it  because right now they changed encoder factory and it looks bad and hard to understand 
yes  it perfectly works without it  the quick fix is to add instanceof check like in https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component validator mapping membermetadata php#l53   this works for me 
yeh  good catch  ro0nl  unfortunatly it doesn't fix the original issue  i edited my orignal post to avoid confusion since after correction the issue remains the same 
that's what i have done in my project but it's not that easy if you have worked with intl and libicu  first of all you have to have one object for each formatter type  then in some formatters you have the option to set a specific pattern  apart from that  it is interesting to put this into a service as it is not necessary to create one formatter object each time you want to format a date or a number as long as the locale doesn't change  taking my previous example again   i do not want to reimplement it  but wrap those functions and methods of the intl in a more easy and reusable way  in such you don't have to take care of creating numberformatter or dateformatter objects  using all the locale features that translator already provides  i'm pretty sure that most sf projects have some kind of service or helper to make this stuff easier  why not implementing it in a sf component  maybe your point it's that is already easy to make this and therefore the user should be able to do it by itself and not the sf core 
 inmarelibero mmm i can't see how that could be useful  i don't have the chance to remove the route   louterrailloune yeah  that's a feasible option  but needs quite a lot of work   koc as you said   it's a workaround  p
i'm simulating an e2e test with some interaction between an "admin" client and a "normal" one
well should work _like_ the javascript versions where you have buttons  would think with some clever naming of thoose buttons and their positions it could be possible to have working out the box 
 tobion i am adding accept header format checks on routes  so i have a formatlistener that listens on kernel request and sets the request format depending on the accept header  that format then needs to be validated on the route  _format  which is impossible because it is part of the regex  and therefor the  matches array  to do this i have created a custom requestcontext which have a set getformat method and does the check on that in handlerouterequirements or when dumped like the methods are validated 
just checkout the master of symfony standard run composer update and then  bin console cache clear  and see the generated container code  p s  i do have apcu installed 
thanks for the tips  the error is triggered on any url  i've tried to use the default security yml from the  standard edition  https   github com symfony symfony standard blob 2 1 app config security yml  but i get the same error  cache cleared   the security part of the profiler says the following for the url     or any other url    1 api false method did not match  expected one of ""  but got "get"    2 webapp false method did not match  expected one of ""  but got "get"    3 oauth_token false method did not match  expected one of ""  but got "get"    4 oauth_authorize false method did not match  expected one of ""  but got "get" 
definitely a work around  however  i believe a temp dir is exactly that  temporary  and so you should be able to wipe the tmp dir at any stage to clean things up and not affect the app  i e  not wipe the cache   sure  you can wipe the entire cache and it's warmed up automatically when next needed  if you did a file upload  say  a product image   you could upload it to the  app tmp  dir  rename the file  move it into an assets dir  etc  you might also do a file generation  e g  zip  to email to a recipient  it can be done in the  app tmp  dir and then cleaned up at any time and not interfere with cache  to me  cache and temp files are not the same and so it's not logical to put them together  what do you think 
  stloyd  i will try to get more info if it appears next time  i am lucky that i am not the only one who has this problem   
i'm extending the console application class  and for example i can't access to the commands array  also i can't edit the definition property if this property is not set as an instance of inputdefinition and so i must use the parent constructor   console application  __construct    
no  if i use   process isolation gives error in all the tests  phpunit_framework_exception  phpunit_framework_testcase   name must not be null

confirmed the tests pass with 4 3 5
 lu4e3ar you can try to normalize your field value before binding the form
im doing this because my form is initially associated to an object  but depending on some dynamic custom validation  the underlying object may be changed  i though i could do this in the form  because this is actually a real form thas has constraints applied to it

i'm setting the  data_class  on  setdefaultoptions   furthermore  the documentation says it is "guessed based on the validation rules"  not based on data  imo  it would not make any sense  
sorry  i had misunderstood what you said about "remove the configurability in 2 4"  i understand now and imho the stepwise seems reasonable  do you checked the  a  again 
the bug is described here  https   github com symfony symfony issues 6651
 iltar  i've written validators that are services and use the di container  so i see your point  the idea of specifying dependencies in the doccomments  as in your example  doesn't appeal to me at all  i wonder if perhaps validators that have no dependencies  other than the object being validated  could be inlined into the constraint class  with the option to write a separate validator class  typically as a container managed service  for more complex validation  if this were possible  would the dx convenience outweigh the loss of consistency of the current approach 
i've updated deps on the remote server  now monolog is at dd0b216e0229a24178c2f0782f8a7172c7ed1c96  i'm still getting this issue and a 170mb log file  but actually i don't think it's because of monolog  the huge log file looks like a side effect of an infinite loop or something like that  i'm still under the impression i have the same issue than  craue in #7043  i've also noticed another page where it happens  both of those pages are related to fosuserbundle  registration page + edit user preferences page   unfortunately i can't investigate more than that as i can't reproduce it locally  it only occurs on the remote server

i'm a afraid not  my public bundles are just libraries without webtestcases  i'll try publishing an example  by the way i get the same error in a simpler case   just requesting another page  it gives the error  does it work with you 
 nicolas grekas i can confirm that #28760 fixes this issue 
hey  you need repo with example  it's very simple i reproduce it with   symfony new test_dump 3 4 4  in  app resources views base html twig  i added     dump app request       then in  app config services yml  i added to services section   now it renders dump ok  when i change in  composer json   "symfony symfony"  "3 4 4"   to  "symfony symfony"  "3 4 5"   and call  composer update   prefer dist   prefer stable  after installation dump is wrong  rendered by  twig_extension_debug    looks like with var dump we don't need this extension anymore  but it sf shouldn't change so much in minor release 
the tests in my fork are against the current master   should i rebase them onto 2 4

ok  i found the solution  it actually does not matter what the name is because the  code path  code  parameter is missing in config yml  it would be nice to add to default config yml   code  path   database_path   code  so one can use  code database_path  code  in parameters yml the documentation should better cover the sqlite usage

fine i will create a thread in mailing list
not sure i understand you 
 nicolas grekas nope i have this problem even when i force error_reporting to  1  yeah when e_user_deprecated is screaming you get the trace but this won't help me when the first scream is from a third party bundle  but setting  traceat e_user_deprecated   won't trace anything  it really should at least trace the first exception but not even that is happening 
the user is disabled  i am using the  equaltableinterface 
alas my communication skills have failed me again  there are two use cases for the new proposed propertyaccessor  which by the way would be a new object only to be used if the user really wanted to  so it's not going to impact the existing property accessor at all  use case 1  a pdo database query returns an array  an entity is created using reflection  no constructor is called   values from the array are directly transferred to existing properties in the entity without using get set  properties may be private protected public  the same process can be used in reverse to extract an array from the entity to post back to the database  this is essentially the same process that doctrine 2 currently uses and something that perhaps other persistence layers might find handy  in other words  we are just pulling a bit of functionality from a complex component and making it available in simpler one  exactly what happened with the form component  use case 2  private protected data need to be transferred from a business object to a dto which in turn can be fed to the form system or perhaps a reporting system  currently  this means that for each private protected property on the business object will require a getter  but in this use case  the only reason we need all these getters  they have no business semantics  they always just return the property directly  they clutter up object just to support transfer objects  in other oop systems  these properties would be defined with  public readonly  property  and yes we could use __get here which is not as bad spelling out getters for each property but still clutters things up and is not necessary from a business perspective  so we could envision the controller asking the domain layer for a dto with the necessary information to support a given request i e  domain command   the domain layer would generate this request by using the new proposed accessor  the domain layer can ensure that directly accessing the property is the same as using a getter  the dto could then be used in a form  in fact the domain layer can can decide if access is appropriate based on the current security context  are we breaking encapsulation on the business object  not really because  1  we can let the domain layer decide when it's okay to to bypass getter setter  2  other languages support the same methodology with a readonly attribute  we are once again just trying to implement readonly functionality with cluttering the objects with getters  or equally annoying majic methods   3  doctrine uses the same methodology  does doctrine break encapsulation  if so one might argue that we should drop support for it  humor   again my communication skills are lacking  this article  http   www whitewashing de 2013 07 24 doctrine_and_domainevents html written by benjamin eberlei  yes the benjamin eberlei  shows how to write an inventory item business object with useful behavior but without getter setters  my proposal is basically a way to make it easier to edit show the item without adding getter setters majic clutter 
no it is not the solution  because when you do have a value different from     the priority should be set to 17 as proposed by the cookbook article  the framework configuration does not seem to properly support null values        it seem to return  en  with  priority  17  the point is that the behavior is weird when you reproduce the scenario of my previous comment  symfony  2 5 x  still does work properly 
nope  never found a solution  had to use a lot of debugging to figure out my problem  a shame this issue is being ignored 
yes thanks  this fixes it for me 
it just seems strange that it says it supports glob  but only partially  and that you would need to write a hard to read regex or chain multiple calls for things like    name '  jpg'   name  '  jpeg'   when something cleaner like    name '   jpg jpeg '  could do the job  just my 2 cents 
the last from composer 2 1 x branch
although i don't see the point of having this command in the doctrinebundle  why isn't the init acl there too   i will open a new feature request there
a use case could be this  imagine you have two authentication providers  eg   database  and  in memory    both firewalls could be applied to all the routes  but users accessing a website from the internet would use the  database  provider while users connecting to the website from inside the network of the server would use the  in memory provider 
 tobion  it wouldn't work  seems like something overrides my override   
to be quicker  i'll give you classes and code to reproduce it  productcategory entity   just tell me if i'm missing something  thanks

 bschussek that's exactly the point  what  stof already mentioned  we now have an existing property that can't be populated via the usual ways  annotations et al   i explained my particular needs in stackoverflow  the question is linked in the first message   i need to provide a constraint error code in addition to the violation message  it will allow an api to check which error was thrown comparing against an integer instead of the message   of course  i want both fields  not just one  as the message is nice to have _and_ it may change for different users  i18n  
yes  i added a code to auto login  but this user is logged at backend firewall  and expose a exception 'permission denied' that's right my action  http   pastebin com xk8qxchr my security yml  http   pastebin com 5nguhps4 route to action is  usuario registrar
 jakzal i am trying to create small project with described behaviour  but there are no magic in my code  my actions with  spl_object_hash  were just for explaining the reason  why this exception throws 
i can try but i am not sure when exactly  maybe this friday 
which is bundled in symfony 2 8 8
i can  wouldn't that just be a workaround though 
yes  the error is  uncaught referenceerror  buttons is not defined  at the  inittabs  function   the  clickhandler buttons i   select    line is throwing the error 
ok thanks i didn't see this project
will open a pr for the first part  looking at using expressions here  seem like using them in this way was rejected  https   github com symfony symfony issues 9658
i have nothing special just upgrade 4 1 to 4 2  from old project  and got an error on  cache clear  process 
another question related to this though  i have fixed all my application usages  but composer is still complaining  i suspect this is coming from a third party bundle  but i am not sure which or where just yet  the problem is that i can't suppress those warnings in composer and it will cause a deployment failure on the  cache warmup   any tips on that issue 
looking at it again   maybe the real issue is that the silencing is broken here 
i was hoping it'd be obvious enough that   previous  is not an integer  below is an example controller that contains routes that trigger an error in each one of the classes 
 nicolas grekas https   github com symfony symfony pull 26762#discussion_r178813692
 stof the same can be said about all autoconfiguration  why was that feature added then 
 yceruto you mean as first step deprecating  geterrors  call without parameter and later on allowing it again with opposite default value  yeah i think that might be possible as well 
sorry  forgot to mention   2 3 4   clean install from official symfony_standard_vendors_2 3 4 zip + update via composer  but from git i see only vendors  was updated  i have git repo for entire project directory except cache dirs 
linux  ubuntu  after composer update i've got  still got the problem 
it's a custom authentication method  is that a problem 
the  opcache save_comments  was enabled  but  opcache load_comments  was not  i've enabled it and now all works  thanks a lot for the help 
here we go    theme is a dummy block  nothing special    other templates are below   is this related to using variable  translation_domain  with  trans_default_domain  instead of concrete domain  #### theme
i mean a lot of dependencies depends on phpunit like doctrine  monolog  etc  yes  it's dev dependency  but it means even if we do not require it obviously in my  composer json  when i do  composer install   dev  composer will install phpunit in my project as a dev dependency anyway due to those relations  so as i understand phpunit and phpunit bridge just can't be mutually exclusive because it's impossible do not install phpunit when installing composer dependencies with   dev 
so  i did a little digging  this is what i found out    this bug was introduced in ab716c6   my initial suggestion to call  parent  collect    after manipulating   this  data  would not work since that array gets initialized in the  parent     ro0nl's solution might work with minimal effort  need to override  parent  serialize       i propose another solution  split the logic in 2 methods  one that performs the collection  building the array  and another that calls the first and then freezes  clones    this  data   finally  looking at the commit that introduced the bug  i'm wondering what other collectors are affected  thanks  
sorry  i forgot write down the version  it is 2 4 0 
i think i just found the issue  my project namespace prefix wasn't  app   i set  app  in the example above to "anonymize" code   but i forget to update the  composer json  to set the correct project namespace 
"symfony dependency injection"  "2 5 x dev"  "symfony config"  "2 5 x dev" tried 2 4 as well
 wouterj  i beg to disagree  the sf docs suggest all over the place that some kind of voodoo magic allows the various components to be used independently from one another  i fail to see why bundles should be any different  if the docs are anything to go by  i should be able to cherry pick the sf kernel  a few other components  a bundle here and there  and start coding  reality is admittedly very different  indeed very sorry  the sf components nearly all depend on one another in hidden and undocumented ways  and the various bundles i've tried here and there depend on things that their composer json files fail to mention  namely  they pretty much all assume you're using the sf standard distribution  it's as if  for all its test coverage  sf components are never tested individually without the heaps of dependencies introduced by  composer install  without the    no dev  option  speaking for myself  my vendor folder went from having half a dozen sf components to the sf stack in full  plus the framework bundle  just to be able to use twig  and i'm pretty certain that by the time i'm done i'll have the sf standard in full  and simply rebase the entire project on top of that  the point of this ticket  though  was not to whine that twig shouldn't require things it doesn't need  it was to highlight that when you simply add the twig bundle to your project's composer json file  create a bare metal appkernel class to bootstrap the bundle  and run  composer install   no dev   you're currently in for an unwelcome surprise if you were hoping to call it a day and start using twig  as such  allow me to spell out the only two sane options  1  change the check in the exceptionlistenerpass so it compiles without raising an exception  e g  presumably by calling   container  hasparameter    prior to  getparameter     or 2  move the framework bundle requirement from  require dev  to  require  in the composer json file 
 nicolas grekas it works for me
it's not the case in 4 1  my tests found it while trying symfony 4 2  this is because we are now asking for the mime type but the file was moved  it don't know how to properly fix this 
not sure if i saw it somewhere online or just in the source  why  does it matter 
it is example  it is not implementation  require the ability to change the nested key
yea sure here is provider for admin_db
okay i did some more testing  i'm not 100  why yet  but this does not work 
thanks  stof for your response  i would replacing uploadedfile and file class to override some method like this  the actual project im working on have some specification like   the folder permission for upload never ever should be 0777
i will tell you my current use case  i have 2 entities  user that extends fosuser and profile that contains firstname  lastname  address  and others  now for a current promotion  i need to create a landing page with some fields from entity user and some fields from entity profile  then i need create a model with this form 
hm  the service file from above reproduces this  what format do you need 
using sonataadmin  might be an issue of the sonata admin bundle then 
 jakzal  yes    is the same feature 
i have already done and it has the class 'form horizontal' but not the one i specified  and of course it doesn't have the id property set 
file   etc php5 cli php ini     gromnan using your command returns   error_reporting    6143    6143 
i had this error with the symfony 2 3 18  but i can not build this error on a new project  i close this issue while i can't re build this error 
 nicolas grekas do we need a revert on this  or can we just ensure the filesystem supports exclusive locks before actually doing it  happy to put in a pr to do either 
ho yes sorry  i'm expecting that  in the context part of the log  the message is serialized     "lotid"  "1234"  "price"  42 2   
here also  https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component dependencyinjection container php#l301 in services php
use case can be this same as in sf2 cookbook  user and premium user  with credit cart   lets assume that on a registration page is a checkbox  is premium user   when is checked user needs to provide a cart number  when checkbox is un checked   cart number is not required  to enable this kind of validation its require to create validations group  default + promo   and so some logic inside formtype  set default validation group   it would be much nicer to make it more like 'group sequence providers' and move logic of chose a default validation group to entity 
 xabbuh please have a look at https   github com symfony symfony pull 20857 i recommend to revert asap and to look for a new solution  i dont think it will be an easy solution 
that is the config i had  with this config the twigextension load method will not be called  once i removed the config setting the load method is called and the proper template is located 
 xabbuh i may say why not 😁   i'm coming from silex and love to tweak things  i should be able to decorate override whatever is in the framework  in this case i'm planning to port a silex app to sf4 and the language files are split in subfolder by domaine with multiple files within  on for each controller module   so i want tout keep the files as it  little files are easier tout maintain imo 
difficult one  the datalist ids might be generated by using  spl_object_hash    for objects that implements  choicelistinterface   arrays might be a problem though  wrapping the same array into an  arrayiterator  for instance gives two different hashes  but maybe a relatively fast   simple md5 serialize array   might do the trick  another way would be to specify a datalist id manually  that overrides a generated one  but somehow care should be taken when datasets are rendered to make sure they are not rendered multiple times 
there is a misunderstanding here  my previous message wasn't clear  sorry  in my case  the original object passed to  varexporter  export  was perfectly instantiated and valid  the issue is  that varexport then call the registry  which try to serialize a "clone" of my initial object created without constructor  i don't understand why it do that btw   see https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component varexporter internal registry php#l101 here is a reproduct case https   gist github com jderusse d12b8bc39e8335c72332dc153da26000 you can test it locally with melody    
i've done the exception bit you mentiomed before but there are two problems with it    it caises the terminal commamd to die so messages are not consumed anymore    rejected message won't go to dlx because it doesn't exist as i mentioned above 
no i do not  just a regular dedicated web server 
it's not an exact copy but it's something like this 
it's better but i would probably still need to look at the source code to find out what the method actually does  i'm trying to come up with a good method description but it's kind of hard as this method is really a bit overloaded  something like this maybe 
output is  int 0   found the reason   it's because mingw is installed on the system  thanks for your help 
 blamh i'm not able to explain it another way  if you can't understand that running  should produced the same results  because  list  is the standard default command  but it could be another command defined with the  application  setdefaultcommand    i used another option here      profile    but consider as  jzawadzki said in https   github com symfony symfony issues 12535#issuecomment 64947583  if you use the standard    no ansi  option to disable color output  for example to redirect output to a file  if the symfony team consider that this behavior is not a bug  they should noticed them in official documentation       and close this report 
in the  intl component  http   symfony com doc current components intl html

well  i can't seem to reproduce this on either the master branch or the v3 1 3 tag  it's likely something odd with my current application  closing unless i find a way to reproduce this on a fresh checkout 
 jakzal  tobion i dont need to configure some third party bundle  i need a way to tag my own routes  so my request listener can do its stuff on those that are tagged  so  i import all routes from controller api dir and set some default x on them in order to activate request listener on them  and that's all fine  note that at the same time  i have other routes  controller html  that don't need this request listener behavior  but now i need for one of all those api routes to remove that "tag"   the default x  semantically it's part of the api  so i put it in the controller api dir  first thing i tried was to set default x to empty value on that route  but that didn't work since default values from import has greater precedence  which i reported in this issue  i know i have other means of telling request listener to decorate  but this one is simplest and most obvious  all other options are more complicated  1  use other default y that will disable the behavior  though enabling default x was set 2  put them in different dirs  and import first w  and second w out default 3  put default values individually on controller action level  rather then on import do you have any other suggestion how to execute request listener only on some routes 
 javiereguiluz yes  the error remains 
centos
this informations can also be useful to reproduce a bug from token created in production or shared by a other developper  with this  we can checkout the same version locally  moreover  monolog has also a  similar way  https   github com seldaek monolog blob master src monolog processor gitprocessor php  to inject git infos in log  know commit can be useful to reproduce a bug in similar conditions from old external token  yes  a   git status   in wdt would be also very usefull 
certainly in production but while the development  some people are still using a web app through a vagrant with nfs as a filesystem for instance 
just     dump app      should reproduce the issue
 xabbuh i know that its a miss usage of texttype but i can't find any alternative to submit unstructured set of data  i thought maybe following could do the job   but then i got a  extra_fields  error  when adding allow_extra_fields the getdata is empty array so this also doesn't work  so what i'm basically searching for is for a unstructuredtype  arraytype or datatype or something like that  i tried to build one myself but could not get it to work maybe you can give me any hint 
sure  i've just tried with quick pull request but i will prepare the proper one yet today
this may be done in doctrine proxy factory  but throwing an exception is not doable in  php7 at least  as it may throw a fatalerror
 xabbuh nope it isn’t  what #26540 relates to appears to be an expected behaviour according to the docs  will comment there
i've got a constraintdefinitionexception 
because this factory is well made and integrates the majority of needs  so  yes i can create a custom factory but i think this isn't productive 
 tobion well im confused   imo escaping should be done by default because its expected behaviour in other hand i can understand it collection element should be visible for frontend in dev cycle  i think best way whould be parametrize or something like that  for now its rather messy in html    in that case in all my projects i should create custom form themes just for create collection prototype expected behaviour     heahdude imo its just missing    e  after  form_row  of prototype just like in  tobion docs reference 
 dmaicher  i test  and yes  it working  can you explain why   it's really normal    components  notifi     is not a good syntax

the last one  v5 1 1  i came from v5 0 1 
while writing this  your answer came  so first my other observations  that are consistent with your answer   i changed the model format to represent the correct count  but then i see that the "normalized format" is still ignored  seems as the children of the collection are created before the data transformer is executed  or basing on the "model format"   model format   so yes  the children are actually created on  pre_set_data  and the data is later loaded from the "normalized format"  hoping best that no transformer changed its structure meanwhile  i solved the problem now by changing the underlying data format to be directly usable by the custom type  that was pure luck as the format was not yet finalized  if it was  i would have had a bigger problem here  what i wanted to solve is a problem the modeltransformer concept imho is made for  i have model data that is not compatible directly to the form for it  that is in the current state not compatible to the  collectiontype   when it involves changing the count of items or when the "model format" is a hashed array instead of a list array  which breaks a  collectiontype  and now cannot be repaired by the modeltransformer     at least that very surprising limitation of the modeltransformer for  collectiontype  should be documented    it took me a whole workday now to find out wtf is going on here  writing a reproducer and changing my code to work around that limitation  do you have an idea how to solve that problem  if someone cannot change the "model format"  maybe transform the data on  pre_set_data  with a higher priority than the  resizeformlistener

i would like to be able to get a "synopsis"  usage definition  of an optionsresolver  we use this component in order to improve usage of our project twig "extendable templates"  extended by our front end developers   we have some "extendable templates" with many options  the optionsresolver is for us a good way to let them use our extendable templates easily  and i would like to developed a twig extension to list available options  and them default values etc   a kind of "docopt" of an "extendable template"  or in other way  a better exception message when options are not correctly used 
 mricherzhagen i also have some concerns about that issue and am not 100  sure its fixed for all possible use cases out there  see https   github com symfony symfony pull 24535#issuecomment 344596586 if you still experience issues  not related to silex  then please open a new issue  wink 
i have implemented a workaround  just need to test it at work to do the pr  em 20 06 2015 18 23  "tobias schultze" notifications github com escreveu 
to reproduce it with  in_memory  ill must to change a lot of things  there is my provider 
here's an example of how i'm going to attempt to solve this for drush  https   github com drush ops drush pull 3594 files however  instead of every upstream library trying to implement that in its own way  i think it might make sense to implement it in the filesystem  especially since symfony itself has suffered tremendously from this same bug  which many people consider to still be unresolved  #2600 i think roughly the same approach could be applied as for drush  basically  just drop a semaphore file in the directory that's about to be removed  and don't remove directories with that file  if you're worried about adding complexity to the existing  remove    function  it could be a separate  saferemove    function or something 
 iltar yes  it persist 
sure  i will do in the evening   
 chalasr helpful indeed  but still you can have nested variables like  foo  " kernel environment _test"  
 blixit i expect that help command prints correct command usage  currently of you copy paste usage from help output you will get the error mentioned above 
thanks  i forgot to mention that i am using symfony 2 5  is there a alternative in this version  i am not ready to upgrade  
 dmaicher   hi  i updated the issue 
call the command without arguments  the second validate   will pass because of the check using count   right inside validate   
here is an example of the situation  for simplicity  it is the list of users participating in a meeting  first entry  saved and page reloaded    select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_0_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  0  user " class "select2 form control"   database entries    meetinguser  id 1  position 1  user 1 second entry after adding via jquery    select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_1_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  1  user " class "select2 form control"   database entries    meetinguser  id 1 position 1  user 1   meetinguser  id 2 position 2  user 2 after switching using jquery  only order in html has changed  but not the ids    select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_1_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  1  user "     select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_0_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  0  user "   after ajax saving  nothing changes in the gui  but only in the database  database entries    meetinguser  id 1 position 2  user 1   meetinguser  id 2 position 1  user 2 when switching again  without reloading the page   only order in html changes    select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_0_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  0  user "     select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_1_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  1  user "   database entries    meetinguser  id 1 position 2  user 2   meetinguser  id 2 position 1  user 1 after reloading the page    select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_0_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  0  user "     select id "appbundle_meeting_meetinguser_1_user" name "appbundle_meeting meetinguser  1  user "   i made a little experiment  after switching with jquery and saving via ajax  i manually switched the ids and names of the items as well  in firefox's "q mode"   this resolved the problem      to me it seams that the problem lies in the fact that after first switching and ajax saving the ids of the elements in the gui do not correspond anymore to the ids they would get if the form would be built by symfony's form builder 
sorry  i was certain i commented re my use case    nuthshell  i have a method that walks a array object structure   as it walks the structure it may add listeners that will be dispatched when the walker walks the the "node's" descendants  ie  this callback applies to this node and all descendants    etc  when walking a new structure i would like to clear all the "structure walking" listeners and start with a clean slate    a new eventdispatcher instance _could_ be used each time but that has its own set of issues
sorry guys  it happened to be a nasty bug in the code  the selector works as expected  thank you so much for your time and quick response 
 jakzal    because they don't think  mostly not on purpose  cause of bug  or inexperienced developer  in case of sylius where i found the bug was a bug after refactoring  call to method in constructor of twig extension  that started the session  the point still is  _currently it is possible to break the cache clear funtionality by starting a session  so should it be fixed  and how _
1  yes 2  2 5 12
 iltar  no  the bug persists even if the properties are private  indeed  that is my actual use case  i only used public properties above to simplify the example  
 nicolas grekas i re enabled gc  and this is definitely the source of the unclosed files  i added these lines at the beginning of the first run test    stof i agree that gc should be enabled for unit tests  i expect the tests to be run in an environment as close as possible to production  if the code makes php crash  the tests should show it rather than hide it  i have never experienced any segmentation fault during unit tests  with recent ubuntu   debian releases  14 04+   7+   this seems to be related to this php issue  closed in 2012  https   bugs php net bug php id 60825

what it outputs _is_ perfectly valid but it would be nice to have a choice on that output  the api right now for dump is   public string dump mixed  input  int  inline  int  indent  bool  exceptiononinvalidtype   false  bool  objectsupport   false   an extra option could be added  preserveliterals  which would expand strings with new lines using the literal style  http   yaml org  states  the output right now  without somehow supporting literal style and folder style  is not human readable when dealing with long strings 
a full example of what  triple forms i'm using  what are just three identic forms in row  or do you want non existent example of simplified version  i'm here just asking for the feature that would simplify creating ajax forms  i do not know how exactly do that  if i knew that  i would show you fork for review  last thing is  i do not need that  triple forms work fine  it is task for others to say what they will do  if they try simplify this  or add triple forms in documentation as example of ajax form  or just ignore this 
ok thanks  i filter the code and post here soon
i have the same output as  lxg  
got the pid from getpid    however is there is better way to do it  i will post the question on stackoverflow  thanks
at the moment  yes  this is a legacy codebase and we're slowly working through the process of actually applying namespaces to it at all  on mon  nov 30  2015  18 28 tobias schultze notifications github com wrote 
i tried    and after many attemps i figure out  i had one change in choicetype php my mistake  sorry
 confused  you're right  not a specific issue  just that you state to  follow the psr 1  http   symfony com doc current contributing code standards html   but maybe your target is more important  thanks for taking the time to answer my question  glad i didn't spent time on the pr  wink 
hopefully the pull request will be merged soon  if you need to update to 2 8 or 3 0 now  one workaround is to select the supported node    div   get the domelement object  then use xpath to filter the domtext object  it's not ideal  but it works 
if you use the eventlistener as above and check the  exception  getcode   on a generic page not found exception you will get 404 returned  however if you do the same thing for a route with an invalid twig path  one that doesn't exist  it will return 0 instead

i am already using the symfony standard edition with no changes  except some additional usual bundles  the project was created using 
well  anyone used to dealing with gettext expects fuzzy translations not to be displayed  because they are likely incorrect  people only dealing with gettext through the symfony tools will never encounter "fuzzy" tags  because the symfony tools don't generate them  people using other tools  xgettext and msgmerge  poedit and the like  will expect correct behaviour and will get annoyed by the current behaviour  in my case here  i had a page in preprod with completely funky french strings because they were marked as fuzzy but not yet properly translated into french  having it in english would have been better  while you are at it there are a lot of useful things to borrow from gettext  including translator comments and the place s  where the string was found in the code templates  this alone makes it worth using xgettext msgmerge over the symfony tools because it eases the translation work a lot 
 nicolas grekas difficult to keep the object in my context  the entire application may be left by the user while it is still processing on the command line  opted for a scheduler mechanism in the meantime  https   github com j mose commandschedulerbundle   solved this issue for me  did not try running the process in the background  nothing required for me in this case  feel free to close if the feature is not worth the effort 
the issue with weak mode is that it is still outputting a lot of messages on my screen which make me need to scroll back to see if my tests succeeded or not which is very annoying  i am not aware that i can disable the bridge  i guess it does a lot more than just enabling this deprecation handler right 
thanks  nicolas grekas it works when i decorate the cache app service  btw i think it's weird to have access to the tag method in cacheitem without having the possibility to invalidate items in the default cache app adapter  i would expect to have the invalidatetags method by default  what do you think 
it seems not  i've tried by replacing the content of the files with the pr but i still have "symfony component httpkernel exception notfoundhttpexception  app entity player object not found by the  paramconverter annotation " and " home     vendor sensio framework extra bundle request paramconverter doctrineparamconverter php 107"  sf 4 3 5 is used

i use https   github com friendsofphp goutte library that uses symfony domcrawler     as a web scrapper i can't be sure of the name format   
the library doesn't use any error handlers  only symfony  also i have no custom error handlers with my code either  if that was what you were asking 
phpstorm uses the symfony installer internally  i believe so  it creates a composer   phar file within a folder called symfony and then executes these files  ending in error   do you happen to use windows  i do  i am on windows 10 x64 pro edition  both machines at my home   office run the same os  the symfony framework used to install without any issues and then one morning it stopped working and never came back  do you have any workarounds  or a solution coming soon 
nice idea  i could not reproduce simply with the standard edition and nelmio cors  this issue is related to fos httpcache calling ismethodsafe   without any parameters  which is apparently deprecated  they currently are fixing this on their side https   github com friendsofsymfony foshttpcachebundle issues 323  it seems weird though that ismethodsafe   does not return 'options' and 'trace' if options are omitted  this is a bc  maybe you should include that change in the upgrade 3 2 documentation 
i'm not sure that is related to that issue  in my case the override happen in other bundle and not in  app resources       yes  is working fine at symfony version 3 2 1  upgrade to any version   3 2 1  tested with  3 2 2  3 2 3  3 2 4  and the override does not work any more doing a infinite loop  i'm currently forcing version    3 2 1 of symfony in my  composer json 
throws  the file "data text plain test" does not exist in 
turns out this has nothing to do with symfony  this was due to a flag being activated in chrome to show autofill predictions    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 576772 15681345 143bf5ac 2759 11e6 84a2 f38710633352 png  apologies for the erroneous report

only allowing specific additional fields in a form  for example   g recaptcha response  which is used by  recaptcha  https   developers google com recaptcha docs verify  but still don't allow arbitrary form inputs to be added
 xabbuh it occurs on the 3 3 branch and 3 4   so the development branches 
didn't found mentioned pr  thank you and yes – it sounds like a reasonable solution  i guess this issue can be closed then

i think at the very least that it should be documented that when you are using a custom "class level" validation constraint that the validator doesn't work as advertised  where is  data   documented  i don't believe this is the intended behavior  but since i have found a workaround  and if no one has any objections  go ahead and close   d
hello nicolas  i'm not sure this is not psr 6 compliant  since the psr 6 provides the ability  for a cached item  to specify its expiration time  actually i've created another adapter that does the job  have a look at it  https   github com bpolaszek redis psr6 ttl aware adapter it's just a simple override of  symfony component cache adapter redisadapter   hydrating the cacheitem   expiry  property on  getitem  key    https   github com bpolaszek redis psr6 ttl aware adapter blob master src redisttlawareadapter php#l37 with this simple addition  this adapter does the job as expected  _edit  a check on  if   item  ishit     before retrieving the ttl should be added to avoid calling redis if not necessary  just noticed that _
 null  is returned when the form has an empty name  it allows for unprefixed children   we cannot change this behaviour  obviously 
 iltar   the  argumentconfiginterface  resolvedby  method returns the string class name of the exact argument value resolver  consider a controller   in this case we don't need to iterate over value resolvers  what for  we already know that   product  should be handled by  entityvalueresolver   because that's what   entity  annotation means  we just fetch this resolver by name obtained from  argumentconfiginterface  resolvedby  and call  resolve   as i said earlier  when mapping is present  it's like with validator constraints  nothing to guess  this mechanism will also solve a common   entity user implements userinterface  argument problem  once we put   currentuser "user"   annotation  the resolver will be  symfony component security http controller uservalueresolver  and not  entityvalueresolver  
so in  dev  with enabled profiler this is the expected behavior  right    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2552865 67095267 2c404300 f1be 11e9 9dcd 7834d3130b3f png 
 ro0nl just added a failing test on this fork at line 167 https   github com pherserk browser kit blob master tests clienttest php but due to the nature of the mock testclient  i think it is not reliable

i will  but just any application being 2 or 3 minor version behind has these deprecated messages 
 xabbuh well  for a developer it may not make a difference  but here i'm speaking from the perspective of someone who is   deploying a third party app   on a webserver  in this situation  i cannot pass a path to the constructor because i'm not the developer of the app and i don't want to hack the source code  if the developer didn't specify an   app specific   directory in the constructor call  then i have no way of telling the lockhandler to use a certain   server specific   directory if  sys_get_temp_dir    fails to deliver a useable path  so it would be great to have a place in the configuration files where i could specify a   server specific   path  does that answer your question 
 javiereguiluz i have reproduced the issue here  https   github com mikecpl symfony standard  i have added my validation in xml  userbundle resources config validation xml  and if you fill the registration form  on ' register' url  with 1 character long password  you can see two error messages  if i define the plainpassword property in my user class and put the length assert on it  then the result is same 
yep  i'll try to reproduce  r
i'm using windows in my local system and its working fine there  but in hosting server  linux  it shows error  and yes  i did warmup the cache

the same you add in the response as a  x debug token  header
 tobion what do you mean  the url i have provided is a string i want to validate  i have service that does collect alot of data by school type facilities  and url  like one above  is one of properties i do collect  everything is verified  and given url is valid  exists  and may be visited  get to this url returns valid 200 http response   all i need is to verify if given "string" is "url"  which should be done by url validator  but is not in given case   link from above shows th in their name are very common  however for those validator returns violation 
because there are some options that doesn't exist on some fields  like placeholder or pattern  or data   options  which breaks the form builder  unless i override each field with these options 
 javiereguiluz no i have no php version specified there  if that was the case if would also provide an error when i would manually install it from my terminal which is not the case  i am still puzzled 
sorry if the example may be misleading  the assert fails  so the item is a hit again   ishit    returns true   i updated the comment on the last assert 
no  it still behaves the same way https   github com mhujer symfony envs reproducer commit 278b46a520d5333867ddcb7f61f8b6f8b64c4075
 xabbuh both submitted in iso 8601 format  eg  2017 02 17t00 00 00+0700  as i said before it gives error on osx el capitan  i have tested on my friend's macbook too so it is tested in 2 osx  and it doesn't give error on ubuntu 14 04  this error doesnt occur if i use y m d format    both using php 7 0 15 and both are 64 bit version  but when i change the datetype to datetimetype  the error doesn't occur anymore 
access control goes like this  sstok
 xabbuh i just replaced app php by index php in the  htaccess file 
ok  i will try as soon as possible and keep you updated  thank you 
 nek  you are completely right  i'm trying to use a field other than the id for value on an entity choice list  i thought index was used for the value  thanks 
 nicolas grekas that's a good idea  i'll try that 
i discovered the bug when a middleware calling this was added into the application stack and called in unit tests  and failed unexpectedly by throwing typeerror because i passed the result directly into a string argument 
okay  i was able to reproduce this    clone https   github com zolateater symfony 3 issue   run    go to http   localhost 8000 web error there is also presented route with url http   localhost 8000 web no error it doesn't use custom form type classes  and for some reason it works  please  tell me if i am simply doing somthing wrong 
sure  i will write something to demonstrate this issue  it might take a few days until i have time 
in bouth verson of symfony  
i am also talking about production debugging  i would like the thrown exception to contain the response body   headers   etc  if the client has been declared with a specific option for example  for example instead of having  http 1 1 400 bad request returned for "https   example com "   in log we would have  http 1 1 400 bad request returned for "https   example com "   payload   headers    a monolog processor could do the job indeed  is it better than a new option on the httpclient in your opinion 
it was the prod environment  i can't reproduce it because it is only when the web host  1 1  encountered a probleme with connection between servers  i called the support and they tell me that it is a problem on their side  anymore  the user and password was displayed to any visitors   
ok  i have created a bug report there  however i am still having 500 error while trying to upload file with vichuploaderbundle  https   github com dustin10 vichuploaderbundle issues 710   is it possible to avoid calling fileinfomimetypeguesser or to throw a warning instead of an error to avoid this issue  thanks

after #23082 i do not observe the problem with nullerrorhandler  thanks  and about the "fatal error  unsupported operand types"   i myself can not say exactly why this happens  but say that this happens only when using server_log  i tested this with the "bin console server log" on and off  i added a value check to the array to caststream and  in case of an error  added var_dump  that's what happened  maybe this will somehow help   on macos sierra 10 12 5  16f73

yep  i use  goutte client  i requested a page with form  i found form on page with symfony component domcrawler crawler and used submit    this form looks like   i can't pass field named "action"  will be exception as the code filtered such type of form elements  so the easiest solution is to do not filter "submit" buttons and allow us to pass default values or to change to own values

 xabbuh  essentially  i envision the exception appending the value of   access self  access_name   to the existing message  e g   so  the line of code might look like   formatted for readability  throw new nosuchpropertyexception sprintf  'could not determine access type for property " s" in class " s" s '   property  get_class  object   isset  access self  access_name     '  '    access self  access_name    ''

the issue is  why is this setting set to '0' and not ''  because default is ''  you can't cache via http without setting the config like this

thanks for getting back to me  the issue is with the new abstract class that  mongodbsessionhandler  extends in  3 4   this wasnt the case in  3 3   the new logic within the abstract class  destroy  method is different from the old logic  this new logic checks if a  sessionname exist and throws an exception if it doesn't  https   github com symfony symfony blob 3 4 src symfony component httpfoundation session storage handler abstractsessionhandler php#l136 this is a changing behavior that is backwards breaking  my application which run's on top of the laravel monogdb session  https   github com jenssegers laravel mongodb session  is now receiving an exception that wasn't present before    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 624784 33948800 d969acec dff5 11e7 9f5e 227dfef7920a png  in 3 3  the mongodbsessionhandler did not require the  sessionname exist  it simply destroyed it  https   github com symfony symfony blob 3 3 src symfony component httpfoundation session storage handler mongodbsessionhandler php#l102 further  the open method did nothing in 3 3 and simply returned  true  https   github com symfony symfony blob 3 3 src symfony component httpfoundation session storage handler mongodbsessionhandler php#l86 put more simply  the 3 3 did not care if  open  was ever called  while 3 4 does and this is causing an exception to be thrown with the mongodb driver 
hey sorry for the lack of replies  christmas and such  here is a link with the minimum modification i needed to reproduce the bug  https   github com kdederichs symfony standard tree issue_25576 it will occur when you do a  bin console cache clear  on a fresh cache or if you previously deleted the cache 
hey  interface for 2 7 is here  https   github com symfony symfony pull 27666 this is more of a principled approach  we code to interfaces whenever possible and noticed as we were extending the command class that we could not type hint an interface or even abstract class  just the concrete base class 
 xabbuh by "this fails"  i mean this throws an exception  here's the stack trace   i could catch the exception of course  but i wonder if this is the expected course of events  also  if i call  handlerequest    with same request content  but without calling  setdata    and passing an object to it first  no exception is thrown  like i said  during  handlerequest     the form appears to be setting object properties without checking submitted data for validity first  i would expect it to either validate data beforehand  or to anticipate and handle potential exceptions 
i agree with  dbu  just for completeness  the exception handler of new relic is a function named  newrelic_exception_handler   so this string is returned by  set_exception_handler  
this is the composer json which can reproduce the error  https   gist github com stevro dd16d9230eb4c081448ffbe69a158661 the project was initially on symfony 4 3 but upgraded to 4 4 a few months ago  the issue came up 1 week ago  and i run composer update almost daily  the issue disappears if i uninstall symfony mailer
unfortunately i am not familiar enough with symfony to prepare a test case  i've only reported the issue as the recursive validation in drupal and symfony looks pretty similar and i think that there is a high chance that symfony has the same issue 
 nicolas grekas thanks for your comment  yes  i understand your point  we can implement a new   priority  property on  inputoption  and sort them in a similar way as services  the   priority  will be optional and default to 0  and to be consistent with services we display first the options with the biggest priority  i'm happy to update my pr this way  i will just wait to see how it sounds to you and others if they want to get involved    ps  i will also rename my issue and pr to talk only about options because after reading the documentation again  and think a little bit   sorting arguments would have a really bad impact because they are ordered so if we don't display them in the order you're supposed to pass them people will go through some "funny" situations 
it worked about 2 weeks ago when i started a new symfony 4 project
after downloading symfony by accessing the site public folder i find this message composer create project symfony skeleton symfony4  when i acced to public folder i get this message   datetime  https   user images githubusercontent com 13417561 35183007 208d4438 fddf 11e7 8185 c24d7d3573b7 png 
 nicolas grekas  here is the diff between folders https   gist github com jlekowski 931fd71e06655bfa45a7ac0200e8051b#file diff log after creating them on each environment  i copied them to make sure another warmup will not change anything in there  in general  files generated on host machine contain lines like  e g   getannotations_cachewarmerservice php     after run on each env  var cache dev srcdevdebugprojectcontainer php  changes and points to the right hash  before step 3  var cache dev containerdbj4wfg getcachewarmerservice php  file exists  host hash   as it was created on first cache warmup on host  when i run  bin console  the whole  container hash   removed during the process and error occurs  if i remove the folder beforehand  it behaves as in step 4   after i get the error  the file  folder  does not exist any more  it is recreated in step 4 
in this case the isolation from framework is not required at all  since we need the same configured application  created in bin console 
 xabbuh   yes 4 1 8 also affected this behaviour
https   github com symfony symfony pull 26000   
i already try that  if i put the service back to private the problem is not occurring  however when i clear my cache the problem occur again  so there is an issue for me
 nicolas grekas yes  the file 'create xml' is loaded inside the loadcreate function in the extension class  triggering parsing errors works too   xabbuh not that i know  i just don't get how the service arguments in fosuserbundle get manually wired without them having a "key" attribute like the symfony documentation says 
i don't remember exactly  i think i had some issues with it in php 7 0  but i upgraded to 7 2 after that so i guess i should retry 
fixed 
nope  i use 7 3 
hi   xabbuh and  iltar is this a known issue

thanks  that's a sensible solution  in an ideal world  node_modules  would live outside of bundles  but i've got several bundles that each have  node_modules  and build assets in their respective  resources public  directories  i'll try and dig into the loading process and see if there's anything that can be done to exclude resources earlier  it would give a very small speed improvement for 'normal' use cases too  e g  not looping through  tests    
yes  as mentioned above  also checked with  php bin console about  
the preload happens as the url gets completed while entering it  when the _switch_user was called already once with another user  this url gets suggested as top hit and  therefore  preloaded  as safari does not consider the urls of the visited site as cache  disabling it does not help  as a test just confirmed  emptiing the history  in turn  helps  but is not more feasible than disabling the  preload top hit in background  option 
hmm  if i get the time to  i can try  do you  or anyone else  by chance know why this qualifier is being used 
 xabbuh here is gist https   paste ofcode org kgkbhvy9cmy4vngazsjxty not sure demo required for this  we have custom twig pagination package  it modifies url  like adds uri parameter  page  or perpage  but if we user resolver to validate that data  modify  or check etc  it disappears in controllers method 
very simple  based on symfony skeleton https   github com makm em dupe bug
here is the exemple application  https   github com djpoc symfonybugreproducer 27260 to reproduce  clone  composer install  run  php bin console app dbal typesinfo  2 times  the second one will print only the doctrine included types  without the custom one
yes  i would provide pr  it is old known bug in libmemcached  https   bugs launchpad net libmemcached +bug 1154159
en   i try to create a app but it's right   en   i think is my package do some thing   i don't know so i try create new project from a empty framwork
i think i know the problem now  i was storing info in the session  since the update those infos are lost  and the session id changes on every reload too  even though "session_fixation_strategy" is set to "none"   i think that happens because the session is migrating all the time causing a race condition when my page loads with several requests to a protected route 
i tougth that the ˋproperty  should not be submitted  it’s a strange use case for traditional form but valid for api
your case seems legit   dmaicher  thanks for this answer  but there is another thing that goes through my mind  if the router traces all routes in its storage and there is nothing to match 100   why not taking the configuration from the last one matching at least the route  so in this case it would be "json"  right  better than returning html  😄 at least some kind of preference could be made up with this 
i wasn't directly writing to the directory myself  it was failing because it couldn't write to  var cache   worth pointing out i also had an unhandled duplicate key error which threw an out of memory exception as well
 xabbuh yes  this should fix my issue  wink

please forgive me as i might not have a clue  however the process component  process php  is full of signal handling   what am i missing   https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l17 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l97 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l226 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l298 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l425 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l443 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l727 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l743 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l764 https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component process process php#l780  i could go on but i think this is enough  again maybe i have no idea what i am talking about   all i know is that i had tried to register a signal handler manually  but yet the child process was still terminated    
 xabbuh i'm talking indeed about the hashed password  the default setting is that both raw passwords and hashed passwords are deleted in the  usernamepasswordtoken  when you authenticated successfully  when switching to another user the  loaduserbyusername  method is used to load the new user from the  userprovider   this will return a user with a hashed password that will not have it's credentials erased  when the  contextlistener  refeshes the user you normally return the user with it's credentials erased causing a mismatch between the user in the token and the refreshed user  this causes authenticated to be set to false for the user  to fix this i has to manually set  erase_credentials  false  in security yml and remove the erasecredentials call in my refreshuser method in the userprovider  this makes it all work consistently but i rather erase the credentials even if they are hashed for obvious reasons 
 nicolas grekas nice  i didn't think of that  it does indeed work  the only downside i guess is that the translation isn't as descriptive with the  0   placeholder  over say   name    but this alone probably doesn't warrant the feature be re implemented  will close the issue 
with the php built in server there is no error message  with symfony server i got   error  server terminated unexpectedly  
thank for your help  i do this soon as possible
no  this fix did not help  with it logic looks more correct  tries new  i for all pipes  not only for second  for example   but it did not fix the problem  the real problem in first   unlink  file    in php 7 3 it successfully delete the file  which in use by first process  and start to use it for second process 
i assume my version is not the issue   which php  returns following  it should be same version that bash script uses   img width "538" alt "screen shot 2018 10 12 at 9 38 43 am" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 22645549 46875966 b8c56200 ce02 11e8 9df4 8299153829ab png"  this is my line 32 from console    env    input  getparameteroption  '  env'  ' e'    _server 'app_env'     'dev'  true   
no bother  apologies for the needless noise    
personally i don't like unexpected "magic" functions at all  in any case  for now i have used a compiler pass to revert to the "classic" urlmatcher  but this is an ugly workaround 
i use symfony framework  not custom integration  but even if i use without the framework   every field uses about 5 4 kb
i use a custom layout that consist of a few lines   pre     block form_label_class     col sm 4     endblock form_label_class       block form_group_class     col sm 8     endblock form_group_class      pre 
hi  xabbuh  i forgot to check for new references that i didn't add or weren't in the bundles services yml  there was a definition in another  local  bundle  i've changed it  and i have some other issues  but i'll manage to resolve it  sorry for the bother and thanks for the speedy insight  this bug may be closed 
hello  javiereguiluz and  xabbuh thanks for replying to this  i just want to address one weird thing i just noticed like 5 minutes ago when i was doing more tests  the code i posted above isn't working obviously and throwing the exception  but this one works and i cannot seem to undertand why   you guys have any idea why this would work and the other one  the code in the issue  won't  does injecting the entitymanagerinterface has something to do with it   ## edit removing the entitymanagerinterface will result in the exception being throw  and this is for the 4 1 6 which i intially said works fine  but when removing the entitymanagerinterface it throws the exception as well  i'm sorry as i was not aware of this 
i'll try to explain it with my use case  i'm creating a functional test suite to test an api so in the  class testbase extends webtestcase  i have a method to authenticate the user and get a valid jwt and also to set the headers with the  authorization  and the  content type  headers     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 6040385 50959740 ea160280 14c3 11e9 9c39 9c3eb8e423a7 png  so if you set the header in the test class as  http_content type  instead  content_type  that header will be always  application x www form urlencoded  and the api call will fail because that type is not allowed  by default in api platform   not the same for  http_authorization  because is not checked within this method  let me know if this makes sense of if i can share more info regarding this  thanks
in both cases i'm using latest one  upgraded in last composer update   doctrine doctrine bundle  1 9 1    1 10 0  i just downgraded dependency injection package to make it work again using
 derrabus to use form factory  yep  i can cheat and just copy paste code which creates factory or just get it from container but typetestcase provides useful mechanism for settings types  extensions  type guessers etc  it seems to me it's useful to be able to use both classes at the same time 
thanks for your answer  silly me  it's another problem   pdoexception driver not found  i will close this one and open another issue  thank you 
ok it's clear  thanks for help  😄
i've created slider bundle but this bundle contains third party plugins  when i upload a new file  the uploaded file is moved to the "bundles my slider bundle uploads" directory  example   i can't changed the target upload path because this plugin doesn't allow for this  in this case when i run composer update command  assets install command triggering after composer update and "assets install" command removes and re copies the directory "my slider bundle" in which case my "my slider bundle uploads" directory is deleted  i think if we add the "  override" option  maybe we can solve problems like this  i created my own assets install command  i'm using it for now  you can see in  this gist  https   gist github com emnsen f138ac678d4a7859ea3c931e0a9afeab

i cloned the repo  in the database i have two tables  "test and "testparent"  in "test" i put some random data  and in testparent i put one record with the id 1 and test_id as null  on the website  the form should print every records in test  when i submit the form  i get this   expected  argument of type "app entity test or null"  "array" given at property path "test"    i should've been more specific in my first post  sorry about that

sorry  i was mistaken regarding the exception name  so what i wanted to use is  authenticationserviceexception   it is thrown in  daoauthenticationprovider  when an authentication request could not be processed due to a system problem  in my case it was a database related exception  connection could not be established  which definitely an error to me  i agree with what has been said about  authenticationexception

hi  makasim  thank you for the   this got my a good insight  why the current approach has been chosen  and after reading this comment https   github com symfony symfony pull 26632#discussion_r179084995  i think now is time to reevaluate on this topic and hopefully add the approach using the  consume  method  😄

hi  xabbuh i were on sf 4 2 and upgraded to 4 3  after that this issue appeared  in  composer json  i have    " 4 3"  after all symfony packages  and also have 
my application used simple cache  which is now deprecated  i corrected it  according to cache contracts  i think that while simple cache exists   psr simple cache  should exist in dependencies 
 xabbuh yes  can confirm this resolves it

sorry for the wait  actually  i managed to fix the odd behavior but updating the messenger dependencies with  composer update messenger   with dependencies   maybe some composer configuration didn't to it properly before  or it was a weird package conflict  sorry for don't be able to track exactly what happened  i was trying to duplicate the application i'm working on to link it here but the dependencies are scattered through a couple of other packages  sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for the quick reply

i'm sorry  i should've been more clear  i'm mainly talking about https   www drupal org project drupal issues 3021900 which is a more recent one  where they are talking about implementing the new features introduced in symfony 3 3  in one of it's sub issues it was stated that some of these features reside in symfony config  https   www drupal org project drupal issues 3021899#comment 12909285   but it was decided not to use that component because it would be too much overhead  drupal doesn't need want to use the classes in the symfony component config definition namespace   in https   github com symfony symfony issues 7796 fabpot stated it would not be worthwhile splitting the config component into three components  config loading  config definition  config cache   since that is a decision made in 2015  i was wondering if you still feel that it would not be worthwhile splitting it up  so basically what i'm asking is  if you would reconsider https   github com symfony symfony issues 7796 
 xabbuh to be honest  i have no idea how to create simple application to show you the error  all i can tell you that make user command succeeds  creates entity user php and modifies security yaml  but in security yaml  under providers option entity provider is used  that entity provider from security yaml is causing this issue  just figured out  maybe i can create my repo with exact code that creates exact issue  will post link here
 shkarsardar i want the session started whenever it is written to which is the behaviour described in the documentation which doesn't seem to be the behaviour in practice  https   symfony com doc current components http_foundation sessions html
on the other hand  if you are installing software on aws infra  you almost by default install the aws sdk  so why not use their already maintained logic in that sdk to take care of the authn mechanism  in the end  it's just referencing from within the mailer component  making your life easier  if the aws sdk is not present  just default to what is in the mailer component at this moment  also  if there's a future component  making use of aws services  you wouldn't integrate the logic in there as well   meaning duplicate code in the end  wdyt 
the only thing i thought of was to call getouput with a flag indicating it should also clear the buffer  to avoid two separate calls  that way  the fetch and the clear are all done within the same call  but on second thoughts  the underlying php stream layer is probably still running asynchronously during that single symfony function  so then i thought maybe it could start by setting the blocking mode  then fetching  then clearing  then restoring the blocking mode  couldn't really think of anything less messy  
possibly  the "quick fix" is to unset   this  sort   but the root of the problem  i believe  has to do with the reference to   this   if i'm understanding your proposal properly the static closure wouldn't have a reference to   this  which should solve the issue

sure  let's have  for example  an entity blogpost  a workflow is defined with three places  draft  to_review  published  and two transitions  review  publish   a blogpost entity is created with default status "draft"  then  someone writes this code    blogpost  setstatus 'toto'  or   blogpost  setstatus 'published'   as doctrine and workflow do not communicate with each other  this will not throw any error and the status will be updated in the database after a flush  my wish is  with doctrine listeners and worflows definitions  to check if this updates are allowed  for that i need to compare every workflows with each updated properties on the entity  this works fine  except for retrieving the property concerned by the workflow definition  which make comparison possible

i cannot check it as well as is i like to  because i'm not with my computer  but i will try with ssh  when i check _  vendor autoload php  _  this is what i get  i think this is ok   i'm pretty sure we didn't change anything in this files  i wrote those jobs in gitlab ci   not sure if it helps  tell me if you need more

thank you for your help  xabbuh i did not test that it is correct that the error is not present with    env dev  and    env test  but i did not specifically register the service besides the standard src folder autowire
if i have anderstand  this folder contain the console binary  so when you commit an application developped with symfony  it's not a good idea to comit this directory on the github repository 
umh  this mistake exist in our project  seems to be  intl  related  i'll give you an example project in few minutes  because as weird as it's seems  it's working 
 derrabus we are using symfony 4 3 8  we have checked by   php bin console debug container   and this service was showing so we come to know that it is public  please let us know how to make this public if it is not 
 nicolas grekas you're right   but there is another  include   l458  see in "additional context"   to that line it could be "unsilenced"  as the trick you mentioned applied only for the 1st  include  
i fixed this by using
to serve  sleep php   i'm using my existing vagrant box    mod php 7 4 2  php x86_64 7 4 2 1 el7 remi  remi php74    apache 2 4 41  unix    vagrant box with centos linux release 7 7 1908  core  i'm calling the test script via shell   php 7 4 2   macos 10 15 2
i see the point about not breaking compatibility  i'm working on a project that use extensively  crawlers  not only html crawler  than i decide to conform all the classes to a custom predefined interface  many method maps well to those defined on my interface but others dont  1  suppose i have something like 
i have composer version 1 10 1
i got no error message which is the main problem behind this  and neither is a symfony log entry nor a php log entry created  the execution suddenly stops when symfony tries to refresh the stale cache itself at this line   valid     dom  schemavalidatesource  source    i can not provide my project but i can also reproduce it with the symfony skeleton app   composer create project symfony website skeleton symfonytest  after creating a simple controller   the app gets broken and i need to refresh the cache manually by using  php bin console cache clear  whenever i change something in this controller after running this command  the app is broken again and i need to re execute the cache clear command 
yes  that's how i fixed it locally for me  i was just unsure if that was also "officially" the right solution  thanks  xabbuh
thank you for your feedback  yes and no  #32045 seems to occur on any form with a file upload exceeding  upload_max_filesize  from  php ini   "my" bug only occurs if the formtype owning the file input is   nested   in another form  i have not encountered this issue with nonnested forms  furthermore  in my case all errors are properly translated 
 nicolas grekas done 
not yet  i'll try later  but can't you just imagine what happened if  groupedxdata  is empty at this moment  or it's not possible 
ok  i'll try and update the ticket once it's there 
this is still not working for me  http   jsfiddle net tumwj 55  please notice the difference in the gradient orientation between ie8 and non ie browsers 
i updated it maybe a week ago with the latest tag  i'll update it again today and see if it fixes it  do you recommend people run off master or something else 
i get this error when i click on a point    i use google chrome 33 0 1750 146 on mac
i made  this version of jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net tda2l 5   which has a problem  so if i after the plot renders  i select a subset of the plot  and then click "all" navigator does not select really everything  but has a gap at the end  i think the issue is that later data  with more points  has a larger range then initial data  with less point and lower granularity   so i understand why there navigator plot cannot be drawn for the whole range of data available  because it simply lacks the data in the navigator series  i am planing to fix this by somehow merging in new loaded data  i am not yet sure how can i merge new points in the best way  but ok   but still  it should not jump around even if it does not have data if it discovers that there are data in the main series  so i should still be able to select any portion of that  no 
my only remaining issue is the cut off in case you set neither margin nor spacing  http   jsfiddle net kzoon wy967hv5 1    i suppose it's technically correct  but a bit unexpected 
unfortunatly no  i didn't manage to reproduce it on a simple case  our charts are quite big with several charts on each page and switching from a page to another  destroying the current chart to display the news ones  trigger this error  on ie only   i doesn't have time right now to create the example but i think using a formatter with usehtml and some empty labels  on the xaxis for example  could crash that way       hope that helps  i'll try to reproduce it in a jsfiddle later   
unfortunatly i didn't manage to reproduce it on a simple case  it appears on our chart while we are scrolling   zooming  thus the 'setextremes' is being called   we've got an inverted chart with a custom scroll controller  like this one but in vertical   http   www highcharts com stock demo basic line we had to create a custom component for scrolling since yours can't be inverted   let me know if its possible some day      so there is possibly a lot of setextreme calls  there are plot lines and marker labels in the chart when the error occurs  hope that helps   
it appears to be working with the new highcharts file  i apologize for mistyping  i should have said jquery 1 8 3 before  it was using 1 8 3 when i observed the problem  i loaded the page with the new highcharts file and jquery 1 8 3 and now it's working  thank you 
hmmm looks like using the  http   github highcharts com master highcharts js version no longer has the issue using the http   code highcharts com highcharts js version in http   jsfiddle net km5vv  i can reproduce it usually when i zoom in to include the first tall bar then zoom out  so it is possible this was fixed very recently 
at the end after a lot of trying i managed  i defined in a different way   #container   height  500px  min width  70   max width  80   margin  0 auto    and the div i left without style   div id "container"    div  i have no idea why  but it worked  thank you for your will to help 
hello  i'm using the latest version  data in chart zomms corretly  but scroll in navigator doesn't zoom  you could check it on attached video  at you example  https   jsfiddle net peha8oqh   it doesn't work correctly too  thanks  pavel
http   jsbin com quhuzocetaqo 1  it's embedded in a web component  that might be the reason 
i apologise for raising the issue  i got overly excited and misread the parameter  the clarification totally makes sense now  i am closing the issue as not relevant 
definitely  here's a sample  http   jsfiddle net z1n31ns3 3    the goal is to have a flexibility to specify a custom formatting  as of today  the formatting is limited to three parameters  precision  thousands and decimal separator  defined here  https   github com highcharts highcharts blob 88c0013b0d8a1447fe477af151e64002f59f0ecf js parts utilities js#l932 l937
works like a charm  thank you a lot 
yes  i tried your suggestion in this updated jsfiddle and have the same issue http   jsfiddle net arnabk 05u6zf21 1  if you look into end of  to me it looks like a straight forward addpoint call in the sub window 
for any charts we have a logic that gets the yaxis index  something like  check if there are more than 1 yaxis and return the proper index   so if the global gets polluted  newly  future  chart get's into yaxis hell  i don't see the difference  since we use multiple yaxis i do want the option to set it globally as an array  otherwise i think that it should act like a defaults object to newly created axsis  in any case this is not clear from your documentation 
i believe that i found the bug in exporting js 5 0 7   'copy options internalkey' doesn't exist  and i fixed the problem this way   old    and also changed old    return copy options internalkey     axis useroptions internalkey   to new    return copy useroptions internalkey     axis useroptions internalkey  
here i have tried to show alert popup on click event for data point  http   jsfiddle net saurabheq o64a81dq 
 jon a nygaard thankyou for the quick reply  i have tried to reproduce the issue but it seems that the issue is in the angular directive which i am using  thanks 
this issue is reproducible only in ie11 but working fine in chrome  also when i try to create a fiddle from the source code  the fiddle is also working fine  please suggest 
including boost js solved my issue  thanks 
yes  sure    this series  http   jsfiddle net jmfernandez 3rocq36g 1   with nulls  the whole point is null  and more elements than turbothreshold does not work    this series  http   jsfiddle net jmfernandez 5aye8tcb 1   with nulls  the whole point is null  and less elements than turbothreshold  does work 
yes  but the function description says  "_note that this method throws away all points and creates new ones  for updating the values of existing points  use point update   instead_"  this is not consistent with the default behaviour  the documentation should be updated to reflect the actual behaviour   or the change the default to updatepoints  false so it matches with what the function does  
thanks  pawelfus and  oysteinmoseng  i'll switch to "range" approximation for now as a workaround  ideally  i'd like to be able to use "average" in the future  as i think range may be a bit misleading for the particular data i'm trying to show 
hi thanks for the support  by trend we meant highchart line chart and by pens we meant line series  we saw your example and you have 8 pens  in our application  we are trending 8 line series for a time period of 8 hours and during the entire 8 hours we are storing the data and the same is being displayed in the highchart  in you example if you can trend data for 8 hours and also store the same you can observe the memory leak  note  the data is injected at a rate 1 sec 
here is a jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net dbasner 8457ctpj 11   change the height of the div between something like 200px and 500px and notice how it does not show all the data  let me know if this helps or if you have any questions  thanks for the response 
i was testing on both a real iphone and an iphone simulator  through xcode   i've figured out what is causing the issue  though    highcharts contextmenu  seems to be positioned by adding 24px of padding to all sides  this means that clicking _near_ the menu doesn't close it  same on the demo 
 oysteinmoseng seems your example can not handle long name  for example  it would make whole chart display like below   testone  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10363809 19668814 e5621796 9a8c 11e6 9955 9b43cddd4e4c png  the issue behind that  in chart have width  and you label in such limit can not handled well  so it is needed something like scroll or other smart ways
thank you very mush  it's work    
sebastianbochan  thanks for looking into this  i do not get the problem when calling the js as per your jsfiddle  i do get it however when i use the react highcharts drilldown package  sorry i failed to mention this before 
hello  pawelfus sure  https   jsfiddle net 06b4kvge    
thanks for your reply  using chart reflow   looks more like a workaround than a fix to the original problem  it will be much simpler if highcharts will resize properly according to css rules of the parent element  i've posted just an example  in real use case we want charts to resize on window resize or parent element resize  so it's not so easy to implement logic where you can call chart reflow    for window resize it's more a less straightforward  just using window resize event  for other components  we need to implement some kind of a resizable interface for a parent component  so we can call chart reflow on resize  that might work in some cases  but not sure about all of them  can you please not close the ticket for now  i'll try to implement your approach or maybe someone has other ideas 
hi   pawelfus you may see it just here  http   www highcharts com stock demo basic line look at the value at "begin date" field at the right part of graph and then look please begin date on the graph  ps  range should be selected "1m" or "3m"
hello grzegorz  yes  the github version appears to fix the issue  which is great  one quick note that you are probably aware of — when using  https   github highcharts com highcharts js  https   github highcharts com highcharts js  along with https   github highcharts com highcharts 3d js i see graphics anomalies when mousing over the columns like in the screenshot below  using the currently supported version of highcharts fixes this  https   jsfiddle net ndavis 9hmjpmvt 1

hi  pawelfus   i was thinking about the second way of providing data  an array of arrays with 2 values  under   seriestype data   https   api highcharts com highcharts series line data  i already see a link demoing   arrays of datetime x and y   http   jsfiddle net gh get library pure highcharts highcharts tree master samples highcharts series data array of arrays datetime    so i would like to see the same thing using  pointinterval     pointintervalunit  set to 1 day month year maybe  as a user  i want to be in control of what the intervals on x axis look like  thank you 
tanks  this is what i neeb  without the scroll bar  there is another benefit of using stockchart under highchart

this issue is fixed but i have new issue is my map chart data is not refresh when i click on chart button two
i have a suggestion for what the new "month # without leading zero" variable should be  which is " o"  highcharts uses a subset of the php api  as linked above  in the php api  the standard seems to be to use the next available letter in the alphabet  in lower case  when providing the non leading zeros prefixed version of a value  for instance the leading zero prefixed 24 hour value is " h"  and the non leading zero prefixed version of the 24 hour value is " k"  it's not " h" because that's already taken  and it's not " i"  or " j" because those are already taken  since our 2 digit month is " m"  and " m" is already taken  the next value _could_ be " n"  but i'd advise against that since you're borrowing a subset from the php api  and in the php api " n" is newline char  even though highcharts doesn't support this  
i feel very well that i have solved this problem with the help of my friends 
my problem was solved by making the correct series format  the structure of the array for series and drill down was wrong and i didn't provide the type in the x axis so the name was not rendering  as far as your problem is concerned i think your drill down series has too much data that's why you are seeing numbers instead of the names of the series  try reducing the drill down series and try  i hope you will get the desired output or make the container of the chart wide enough to contain the whole graph 
 offset  60  should look like this  minus the black line  of course     untitled 1  https   user images githubusercontent com 25798597 42961449 65b07a1e 8b54 11e8 9cd6 388cb49d7996 png 
 sebastianbochan thanks for the time and help you did  i get it solved by using reflow   whenever the view changes and it solved my problem  hence closing this issue

hi team  thank you for analyzing  below are updates from our side  we are facing the same performance from long time  from version  5 we observed this problem  before versions not checked   presently we are using version 6 0 7  and in this version also same problem exist  we are getting almost same performance numbers in our original post written on 2018 dec 11 chart redraw   method still takes   1 2 seconds  as per our observations    ie11 has less performance in general compared to other browsers but in this case it is giving very poor performance    chrome is taking around 1 6 seconds and ie11 is taking more than 10 seconds for loading all 4 charts shared in the original post demo  so can you please check  why is there this much big performance issue 
hi   torsteinhonsi thanks  our data structure is different  https   jsfiddle net cheeses a3rm16g8 5 
 torsteinhonsi even your example looks wrong  in chrome   it depends on your screens resolution 
 pawelfus i posted the idea there also https   highcharts uservoice com forums 55896 highcharts javascript api suggestions 36753466 add option to add tooltip in place of credits in h
 pawelfus that seems to address the concern 
 torsteinhonsi yes  my approach can definitely be changed  i was just thinking since it's there in the  code  https   github com highcharts highcharts blame master js parts series js#l2738   i just thought it was publicly available  so basically  if it's not in the docs  it's not meant to be public anyway  so it doesn't have the typing  is that correct 
hi  pawelfus   yes  i have encountered this issue with inactive tab only  for others scenarios  it works fine  please suggest how to fix the issue  thanks  abcksinha
thanks for your response  sebastianbochan  i brought this up only because of the enormous load this bug puts on the webpage's compute and memory footprint  i do agree that for something as innocuous as say  yaxis linewidth    10   a note on the docs would be sufficient 
hi  pawelfus   thank you for detailed response  setting up xaxis type as "category" helps 
to echo some of the sentiments here  i think types would certainly help enforce this  also  the documentation at "https   api highcharts com highcharts yaxis plotlines" does not seem to indicate that all three are required before the line shows up at all  maybe console warnings if not all three are provided  from an api design perspective  i do agree with  mlucool  as a user  i really only expect there to be a strict requirement on the most necessary of data  in this case  i feel like that is only the location of the line  not its style 
hi  here's an example with react highcharts official the problem seems to occur when adding a y axis from an initial state where there are none https   stackblitz com edit react op9awl
hi  pawelfus actually in drilldown charts when we click a bar it goes to nxt level in second level i want to get the table like structure chart in second level
 pawelfus happy to  thank you for the response and for your work  that fiddle works perfectly fine for me with the master branch bundle  glad to see it's fixed in the next version  we'll be sure to upgrade when that's out 
hello  kacpermadej thanks for the reply i apologize  the leeward islands looked like the were just randomly placed data points  i didn't realize the northwest islands were included  i guess what i'm asking then if there is a county map of hawaii that only includes the inhabited main 8 islands  if not perhaps this could be moved to feature request 
 sebastianbochan we are using angular 7 but no specific wrappers  its just a div sized using flex to fit the space appropriately  is there a way to set the number of ticks on the y axis to a fixed number  that might solve the issue as well for us 
i set the fixed width  but unfortunately disabling datagrouping did not fix the issue  about reproducing it  in my demo  click the buttons 1m  3m  1j  3j and 5j in that order  the last button should not be selected  and instead the "from" date in the input box decreases by one day 
hi sebastian  yes  i am using the official wrapper  i am happy to provide a sandbox demo  however  i would say that the problem here is quite apparent  you're referencing a variable that has not been defined  are you sure a demo is necessary  do you have a template i can use 
hi  pawelfus  if you could give me your email id and quickly setup the meeting

yes  the stacktrace is the same  heh    that's just my lazy copy n paste from https   grails org wiki quick 20start#create 20a 20controller here's the new controller 
here is application yml   with database configuration
its only on example     my real case is i have one house   these house have rooms   in the rooms have portals portal belongto room and have destiny other room  each room have one portal when you click you go to destiny room    sorry my bad english 
yes  but i am also clarifying that the sample repo created by  jeffbrown has this issue and i am unable to identify the difference in your repo and his 
i debugged the code and you are right   fieldvalues  contains  identitycard issuedate_year  instead of  issuedate_year   the workaround here would be to manually bind date values right 
no  it doesn't seem to make a difference using  grails war  or    gradlew war  
i know that i'm not providing much because i don't know where to look myself  i can tell you that its all spring and hibernate related 
yeah  it doesn't seem to be related to lazymap"  i am trying to post form data as the command object classes we are trying to bind are as below      here is the link to full spec    https   github com swzaidi sample blob master grails3 3 7 src test groovy student databindingspec groovy looking for some help on how to pass the form data so that it binds to above command objects properly

#### re  caching yeah  the global cache is a bit of a bother right now  it's great we're moving towards local function level caching  i wanted to avoid disabling the global cache  however i was unable to find an easy way to do that with nose after each test   that is without monkey patching nose unittest itself  too much magic    debugging nightmare   or polluting the test code with a new code snippet  requiring us to remember to add it for each and every test teardown   however i've  added an option to run our tests without disabling the global cache  https   bitbucket org petar beam_integrals commits 5bcca1ec179e    by setting the environment variable  ignore_sympy_memory_leak  to  yes   as you can see from  our build time trend  http   ci petarmaric com job beam_integrals buildtimetrend  the testing performance didn't suffer much from disabling the sympy internal cache  done at  build #56  http   ci petarmaric com job beam_integrals 56    
because we have a similar issue in #7868 where  u1 args    u2 args  is  true  but  u1    u2  is  false   where both u1 and u2 are  union   see https   github com sympy sympy issues 7868#issuecomment 52225340
i did not benchmark gmpy2  also  i can't recreate the fibonacci behavior  i wonder if my computer session was just in a weird state  the plain mpmath functions are pretty fast  as good as or better than gmpy   so maybe sympy is just outsmarting itself

sorry  i got confused  i'm on the wrong version  having a list of unique points returned would be great  though  maybe also preserve the order in which elements are intersected by the ray  then list set points   would not be an option 
sage's mpmath is at 0 18 since feb 10  not sure if i will have time and expertise for this  certainly not in a to be released situation  overall  this looks to me related to your inclusion of mpmath code  vs  library usage  about which you have already a few tickets 
yes  please 
tried with fastcache removed as well  same result 
any object is "useful"  in my opinion  for example  in this case  if i'd like to do arithmetic of cardinalities  it might be comfortable to check for   a  b  cardinality     for example  or something similar   after defining countable sets that might be more important and less trivial  but in general   power   even if named otherwise  is a binary operator on sets  just like intersection and union  and i think that there should be a good reason to leave it out  not a good reason to put it in 
try 
 pelegm there is actually a way i suppose    perm  will give you inverse of a permutation  but i was looking for it in the permgroup 
i tried placing a couple of plt close 'all'  in the code and though it did fix the issue  i am not sure if it is the only best solution 
i think it is fixed  because a couple of days ago there was  keyerror  at live sympy org
oh  my bad thanks for your help 
i implemented   mul   already  there is much to do here  we could surely work on this together  
hm  maybe it's the version  i am using latest stable  0 7 6   with python 3 4 3 
hi  i will do so  but since i'm new to github please have some patience 
sympy 0 7 6 here is a script that reproduces the problem  in coming up with the minimal script i noticed that if you take out the sym expand   the problem goes away 
hi  seems fine to me use the first  some little things  should be  some times we make our own matrix    and only to be sure about sqrt  it never sould be simplified even if we have cuadratic or somethings else  thx 
hi  the inv is only a nickname i use for the inverse of the power function  because the inverse off   2 is sqrt  but actually is used as a function  so i can't use the normal nomenclature  basically the relation is 
 aravindkanna that's issue is fixed in pr#10659 
it got fixed thanks  we need to give import and that statement on after other 
yes  thanks very much for the explanation  i had hit this issue with expressions like   2 x   2  which i had naively expected to evaluate to  x   i guess a simple     is good enough 
 animeshsinha1309 sure 
 smichr  tosalonijain actually is this is a meta issue for redirecting "good first issue" label to "easy to fix" label  please see #13465  and sorry for confusions it may have caused  i'll lock conversation for this issue  for further discussion or question  please go to #13465 
thanks for replay

see  pull 14657  https   github com sympy sympy pull 14657 
i believe i fixed this problem by providing the argument modules 'mpmath' thanks 
actually  i am still trying to figure out what is going on with the radial function  half the quantum physics textbooks i have read provide the function with the 3rd power  half without it  the radial function plots in every textbook  however  seem to be using the function without the 3rd power  i really don't quite understand what is going on here 
it can not be used anything in particular  but there is lot of research going on proving this fundamental property of positive numbers  so  the whole point lies to the analysis of the collatz sequence  in that only aspect  it would be useful 
not a bad idea  but i need to get more familiar with the architecture of sympy at first 
this is the form i called   resultant 0 000434782608695652 p2+0 198325410628019 mc  2   1 0  m   mc + 3  mc  
 moorepants it returns the sympy plot object  on calling the function it plotted the shear force  i just assumed this would return none  also plt gca or plt gcf works  thank you  moorepants  oscarbenjamin  jashan498
 arpan612 that is not how it should be done  just change the docstring of function  recognize_matrix_expression  in codegen array_utils py
yes  after running the code it produces empty plot  but this problem is not specific to the plotting module  it also got executed successfully when an expression which includes division by zero was formed and used with other methods available 
would it be a possibility to have jsonp loading  e g  load the model as json using jsonp  and then pass it to the three js lib

so mrdoob's idea basically means turning fog on for the whole scene and disabling it as needed  that makes sense and actually works for me because the backplate is a custom shader with no fog logic  unfortunately  i'm getting weird behavior when i set my fog near and far to the middle and back of my particle system respectively  i want the front untouched   all particles closer than "near" are completely invisible instead of solid like i'd expect  thinking more on this  i'm probably making it harder than it needs to be  basically  i have particles orbiting a flat plate styled to look like a sphere  it works well  but the particles behind the sphere need to be diminished for it to be more believable  i tried turning depthtest on for everything and it _almost_ worked save for some glitchy behavior and slowdown  let me throw together a few demos for you guys to look at  thanks  as always  for the feedback 
it is the same as #932  press the "ray test" button  the method "test_ray" is the main function 
i have the following

thank you very much guys for the quick reply  and sorry it took me a while to answer back  i checked the specs on the machine with this issue and it seems like a good machine  it runs windows 7 enterprise  64bit  with 4gb of ram and has ati radeon hd 3400 series with an intel core 2 duo processor  i should mention though that i'm remotely connecting to this machine  it's not my own machine   do you guys think that could cause a problem  i know one of my friends is experiencing the same issue  i will double check with her  also gero3 i tried webgl inspector and for some reason when i click on the gl button  the page refreshes and the webgl detector tells me that my graphics card is not supported  weird  by the way this is the link to the actual application  http   esfandiarmaghsoudi com apps solarsystem  the weird thing is that in the computer that i see this issue  one of my objects  namely the earth  is completely fine even though it uses the normal map shader  although i've modified the normal map shader for that one so that city lights show up in the dark  but either way i don't get that  any other thoughts  i will try to get in touch with my friend and see if i can get some information from her machine 
i have write a converter using c++  which can translate the meshes and skeletons of ogre into json  it is very pool and it has very much bugs so i haven't shown it up 
eh  here are the images that the scene dae used  thanks a lot  
i extracted the code to make the test  but when i finished  both the test and my main application work fine without that error on chrome     dont know what happen  the only difference is that chrome automatically updated to new version while i'm making the test  maybe that's the point  now there is only an error which said "resource interpreted as image but transferred with mime type text html"  and the whole object was black cause chrome can not load the texture for it  do you have any suggestion for this  thanks 
not sure what that means  i created my material like this 
i've installed recently  but i will reinstall and try again  ati radeon hd2600xt
here is a link to this test  http   geraldineerman com webgl_blendtest html perhaps i wasn't very clear  the question is how to avoid the intersecting intertwining of the 2 animated feet when they tween  on stage click   is there a way to use a "bounding" box radius so that one always renders "in front" of the other when they would otherwise intersect  or "containers"  so that the forms behave more like solids  or would this be more complex re  ray casting + collision  thanks for your consideration   
nope  i try it on a web server to begin with    and when i look at chrome  i can see that it loads it 
everything what i create using webgl disappears after few minutes
sure  http   web01 gt global com cu ruvo obj http   web01 gt global com cu ruvo mtl i tried editing the json file and emptying the colors and materials array  but when i tried console log  renderer info render calls    it stills output 4685  why is this  you can see this version here  http   web01 gt global com cu ruvo2 html thank you very much for your help 
hi  thanks for your reply  my later post includes a live sample   https   github com mrdoob three js issues 1236 i list three things there which i didm't understand  but as my reply there state i found out what i was doing wrongly for point 1  i still am unsure as to the other two points in that post  particularly the issue of the double sided lighting of the triangle  thanks for any help  mitch 
i am goingt to make a sketch after work 
 mrdoob https   github com fllubo learn_threejs this is the source code  thank you
 mrdoob i'm afraid i can't because i am not using this on web application but on mobile application with titanium appcelerator  is there a workaround to load 6 images separately and then make material from it 
http   jsfiddle net ttagp 1 
i agree with  chandlerprall that something like a global  three floatingpointprecision  would be nice so there are less magic numbers  it could also potentially prevent similar issues in  quaternion slerp  and  vector3 setrotationfrommatrix   however  the advantage to something like  ray setprecision  is that you may have different precision needs for different areas of the code so it would give you finer grained control  if that sounds better  i would say that it would be good to also change functions like  where opt_precision would default to 0 0001 if undefined 
hi mrdoob  i fixed the problem  i wasn't aware that you could limit the camera and animation frame to a domelement  put that in and all works great   thanks  
thanks  thats exactly what i was looking for 
ah  translation problem    i don't know if it's the good word      for me  the landmark is the space qualified by three axis x y and z 
of course   http   img689 imageshack us img689 6279 clippingq jpg
just tried it out on chrome  and i get this error
yes i know how to animate with tween  but i dont get how it would apply to translatex  it s not just about modifying properties 
my notebook has intel hd graphics + nvidia geforce 310m  i don't think what my graphics card is trouble   before chrome update everything was fine 
never mind i'm pretty much having an idiot day 
here's the live example  http   jsfiddle net fsodano laups 2  as you can see  the light goes up as expected and stops illuminating part of the cube   but the top part keeps being illuminated even though the light is very far away  i'll look into the pointlight js  i just wanted to clear out if i'm missing an important concept on how lights are supposed to work  cheers   thanks

yes changing some line of code of the example  just for view a plane instead of ninja's head   this is what i get  http   dl dropbox com u 7628959 github_issue normal5 html on the ninja the cubemap reflection seems to work  but on the plane  the reflection does not work   is this the proper way to get the reflection on the plane in normal shader  thanks for the reply
i mean the "sun" object may change and i want to be able to simply switch to a different axis of rotation  i imagine with the dummy object approach this would lead to a repositioning issue  of the earth relative to its new pivot   no  it's also a matter of trying to understand how things work under the hood as well as avoiding creating extraneous objects  but if your say this is the idiomatic way to do this in three js  i would accept that as an answer

right  but does it make sense for javascript 3d library to be worried with browser url based caching  i think maybe effort is better spent simplifying and maintaining flexible api's which will help more in the long run then re implementing features like that  the ability to load a scene from straight json is much preferred  and or with the user providing a url handler call back which can be used consistently by each internal loader induced by the sceneloader  advantages would be more flexibility and clearer responsibilities  disadvantage may be it is a tiny bit more work for the user if  and only if  there exists no default callback  example i use at the moment   which is a little hackish tbh  should probably be a parameter  it also becomes unnecessarily complex due to the event listeners  thoughts 
i would  except for one problem  i don't know anything about mesh except that i was looking up how to use it from a text drawing example     what would be nice is to have a better description of what everything actually does for us and or what it's all for and also some kind of a remarks section like this  http   msdn microsoft com en us library windows desktop dd318396 28v vs 85 29 aspx    not that i'm comparing three to msdn stuff or anything  when i look up mesh in the documentation and see "base class for mesh objects" at the top  that doesn't really help me understand what it does  you know 
 westlangley hi  yes traditionally a hud is done with a separate rendering pass and orthographic camera  this was the way i learned how to do it when i was starting out in the late 90's  but as we game programmers typically like to do  we try to save any calculations that we can and cut corners where we can get away with it  for the sake of framerate  of course my little hud example might not be affected by a second orthographic camera pass  but i have a hunch that a real intensive hud in a fps or space themed game would start to show some degradation in performance  unfortunately i don't have raw numbers to back my hunch up but if someone were willing to test a heavy sample hud using both methods i would gladly go back to orthographic and 2x render if impact was found to be negligible  yes i did some rough math to get the sprites to stay relatively positioned in the window  even with resizing and on mobile and tablets   etc   it should work consistently across all devices  if it feels like a hack  that's because it is   ha ha      but hopefully this will allow someone to just drop in sprites and hud geometry quickly and easily  thanks for three js   i really appreciate all your work   erich
yeah my bad  i installed three js with bower  then when i linked i used  threejs src three js  instead of  threejs build three js   sake 
we’re heavily using blender for content manipulation  validation  etc    of our three js work   one of the really good things about having an ‘importer’ for three js files is that it gives us all another way to cross check and validate our files formats  we’re writing our own three js models from other content design applications  augmenting the format with our own sidecar files  etc  – so having the ability to import  augment and test in blender is really cool  if there are better platforms places to do this  to cross validate    i'm all ears   i'm a newbie to your world    i’ve just started getting into the blender api and python – the ‘snake’ has bitten me a bit  i plan to have this figured out and hopefully working in the next few days  it may not be 100  complete across all functionality – but it will be a good piece of code to work from  at least that is my plans   how about waiting a bit and we’ll both see where i get with this drama       if it works out  cool       if not  then deprecate  work for you

i also think that's a reasonable solution  i was going to suggest exporting the rotation matrix  the downside  and why i didn't suggest it  is that  eulerorder changes the behavior of an object in a way that isn't captured by the static orientation  however  if a goal of the exporter is minimal file size  which i think is a good goal  then not every property has to be supported  for instance i don't think  userdata is exported  on jun 30  2013 12 48 am  "mr doob" notifications github com wrote

code updated based on suggestions from  westlangley and  arodic  you're both right that the orthographic camera settings should not be functions of the window width height  and  again thanks to westlangley elsewhere  i've explicitly cleared out the depth buffer before rendering the minimap  however  i still think this could be a bug due to the reasons i mentioned above  i realize that help requests should be directed to stackoverflow  i do in fact frequently post questions there  that westlangley usually answers  
maybe let's just close this issue since the bug is not pinned any way  and i have so little idea what happened  the other day i took more or less the same steps with another model and it all worked just fine  my prime suspect would be conversion to buffer geometry  so keep an eye on it

to fix this on the poyfill side you could call  disablevertexattribarray   but only if the attribute was originally disabled  there is a  gl getvertexattrib index  gl vertex_attrib_array_enabled   https   developer mozilla org en us docs web api webglrenderingcontext getvertexattrib  call that  gl preserve state  could use to obtain the original state of the attribute  always calling  disablevertexattribarray  won't fix this  if the attribute was originally enabled by three js  the state cached by the  webglstate  will also become invalid  a fix that would work on three js side could be to clear the attribute state cache when entering the  render    loop  this way attributes state changes done by external rendering code wouldn't cause the cache to become invalid

ok that's good to know  but there is still a hard limit baked in now of 2 32 indexable vertices  that sounds like a lot at this point in time but those are famous last words in software development  i also didn't see anything about this change of taking out offsets listed in migration notes which might have saved me some fumbling around  https   github com mrdoob three js wiki migration anyway thanks for the quick reply and feel free to close this after your next response 
and in the renderer it's as well  oh well  i guess it comes cheap so it's no issue to have it several times  so nevermind  i am going to close this issue 
wrong bug report  i searched a long time now  " addindex" didn't break three js it broke some extern code  sorry  for the wrong report 
oh boy     my bad  too late in the night    this was totally not the repository i wanted to create the issue for   
https   github com mrdoob three js pull 5291 there are tests which describe the simple case of what i mean
improving it is on my list    just just wanted to have this easily trackable and visible here  i agree that  flatshading  is more appropriate  at least until we have a good way of generating detecting normals with crease angles  my use case is actually creating more complex geometry from primitives for display of openscad designs  see e g  https   en wikibooks org wiki openscad_user_manual transformations#hull   using three js for geometry processing is a bit of a stretch  but since i'm already using three js for visualization  it's good for prototyping    and i would need the visualization anyway 
no  sorry i wasn't clear  it's not a composer specific question really  but it became a dependency of the composer as i had a reusable pool of render targets  buffers   so now  i also have a generic "reuse a pool of objects" routine that i created  it doesn't have to be bound to a compositor  or anything    it works for any object and pools reuses them  it's more along the lines of all those stackoverflow replies you and others have seen  or made  over the years about reusing objects  pooling them  in general rather than creating disposing new ones all the time  i thought some could benefit from an "extra" of three objectpool  maybe not  idk  there's tons of different ways to do object pools in javascript  and many will probably wish to make their own pool routines  but having a "canned" routine around might be beneficial  would have to be beta tested though  basically you create a pool   and  of course  write those three functions  or omit them if    is ok   anytime you want an object from the pool you call mypool allocate  your optional parameters    when you're done with an object you call mypool expire the object   the pool calls  via callbacks from allocate    the newfunc   when it needs you to make a new pool object  reusefunc   when it assigns an expired object to you  and disposefunc   when it disposes of objects  shrink or disposepool   there's also some statistics on pool use  a shrink   function  an insert   function  for adding pre existing objects to the pool  and a mypool disposepool    a few other functions too 
no problem  http   jsfiddle net 2k3g2g5j  uncomment line 52  looking at this again  i really don't see how this could work considering  buffergeometry fromgeometry  does not copy over the  geometry animations   i could also be going about this all wrong  i've also shown  though it is useless in this example  how i cache the geometry  simplified   which is another issue i see with not having the  geometry animations  copied over to  buffergeometry   i would have to cache the animations separately  tried that  no luck   or keep the original  geometry  around  exactly what i'm trying to avoid

all i've found the cause  the fact that i used the object identifiers for their own purposes  and recorded the information i needed  a new version identifier 71 all become read only  of course i broke all the logic operation  the question is solved  thank you all for your attention 
that looks to be it  i changed the value and it's working    thanks 
i can export  catpart  stl  igs  model  stp  3dmap  3dxml  cgr  hcg  icem  navrep  stp z  vps  that's all supported file formats for exporting 
no i just deleted that one entry  i've been trying to replicate it  haven't been able to so far  if it happens again i'll be sure to investigate properly 
i just think it is an enhancement for the dynamic moving  camera  the camera needs to understand the situation of the scene to update near plane with optimal value  not by human manually  as a result  render always render with the best accuracy 
i didn't see those new commits  yeah  that does it  thanks 
 patrickfuller    yes  the version on the  ortho  branch of your fork works  here's a demo showcasing the bug with the current version in  master   http   jsfiddle net klebba h27avkpa  if you change the external dependency to your version  it works fine  thanks 
thank you for your reaction  it turned out the bug was already solved in the development branch  the reported number of geometries is correct now as far as i know  after looking more carefully through the submitted issues  i found that the bug was already submitted in #5680  sorry 
i agree that  light shadowcameravisibile   true   is very useful and i did try it  however  for some configurations with many lights and overlapping shadow maps it can still be hard to pinpoint issues  the more out of the box aids the better i think  in general though  visualising the depth map like in the example you showed is common practice when working with any kind of sm  is there any argument for not displaying it when having  renderer shadowmapdebug   true   
i would think not  it's the default scene with one cube so i'm guessing there aren't any vertex colors on there  is that what the 'colors' box refers to  i was thinking it was the material colors  diffuse  ambient  spec  etc 
well done 
yes i'll try to do a fiddle  yes i thought it might be since then   physically correct lights   dacay is set to 2   i also have the ground as a box with castshadows false and receiveshadows true 
sorry for the delay   however i am still unable to create the fiddle as i am knee deep in the live project  however i have noticed that this happends only with chrome and firefox doesnt show any such behavior   i will try to create a fiddle as soon as i get sometime

check again same link   https   codesandbox io s jvy6x7r3my no papers to support this and i'm experimenting  maybe reinventing the wheel  this is a bit of shooting in the dark to prevent optimiser assigning coordinates from other "slice" of texture to moved vertex  to prevent unexpected changes i'm comparing distance of vertex change to texture coordinates change and if the difference is bigger than 5  it won't change uvs but will leave them and texture will stretch on currently processed triangle  stretch will bring less unexpected results than moving to another texture area and bringing artifacts  this check can be configurable but with this particular model i find 5  to work the best so for now leaving hardcoded  basically  allow large uv coordinates change when large vertex position change occurs and prevent large uv coordinates change when vertex shift was much smaller  my knowledge ends here  for now  result so far 60  vertices removed     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 5261364 39970134 7c9aa3c6 56de 11e8 8d44 c4e31f821292 png

i added a jsfiddle with a moving directional light  when i run it i see a shadow when the light is furthest away  and the shadow disappears as the light moves closer to the objects  and then reappear again as the camera moves away  the problem depends on the values of  light shadowcameranear    light shadowcamerafar  in relation to the distance between the light and the objects

looks like my previous comment didn't save  whoops  i don't have much experience with  controls target   and so this is probably completely wrong  but couldn't it just be set to where the mouse cursor is when zooming starts 
hm you mean you dr  because it was tl      i did make a details summary for python kwargs  that is a tl dr for that section  tl dr for  mrdoob   what lies in the future for constructor parameterization in three js      when our great ruler does not read a post outlining a solution that conserves the parameter object  😉  
 sidroopdaska i've found some typescript open issues about this  unfortunately  it's not possible to do this currently because of the way the type definitions are written for three js  more info    https   github com microsoft typescript issues 18877   https   github com microsoft typescript issues 9532
problem is  i have never forked or edited anything  so i don't know how  that's why since it's just a simple sentence to put in the documentation  maybe anybody having access to it could quickly edit the page and be done with it   p
windows device manager says i'm using the latest driver but i dont know if there is some place where i can get a more up to date one 
yes  the exporter is from  r75  and the problem can be reproduced with the default cube 
thanks it works fine  i believe there was an issue with my version retrieval 
 mugen87  yes that is correct  if you use the onload callback of loadingmanager instead of the onload callback of the mtlloader itself it works 
hi  i noticed that someone has already reported this problem  but as a pull request  https   github com mrdoob three js pull 8207 commits f60800ebc5d1d3fcd261791f216f34bc980dbe72 i'm having problems building the example in jsfiddle  there are problems to export the mesh i really don't know why  here is the link  https   jsfiddle net alf007 v29xsz6v 3 
all right  here we use   the lasted version for win7 is 5 1 7  i'll rollback r75  thank u

 mrdoob can you please explain it further  i need to make one of my meshes transparent  not invisible  i dont understand how doing  material visible   false   would help  thanks 
same results with chrome dev  canary and firefox as well

ok so here is my use case  i am developing a script which use three js  purely for the 3d computations    not at all for visualisation    this script runs on node js  this script updates the matrices of some three js objects in a scene  these matrices are updated based on a   custom algorithm which includes a shear component   in the matrices  i know  you can't specify a shear in three js directly  but this is irrelevant here  as the matrices are computed outside of three js   alright  now i want to iterate on the development on this script  and the three js editor is a   fantastic tool   for that  just export the   three js scene json   from my script  and yes i checked  the exported matrices still include the shear component  and import it in the editor and voila   a nice 3d visualisation of all the three js objects my script is working on  super easy to debug    however    when importing the scene  the editor   transforms the matrices by removing   their shear component  making them orthogonal  not nice  since i can't properly visualise the output of my script 
i try latest dev version is ok    thank you r89 maybe something went wrong
our case is a bit complex  but you can easily reproduce the issue in render to texture webgl example  code below   we are using renderbufferdirect along with regular scene rendering to prepare some small stuff  lots of dynamic tiles  in the background and avoid scene graph traversal  the result is tile material override the masks and clear not working
that's what i'm talking about  but in the engine check is done exactly as i described above  there  if you look at it  the fog property of the scene is compared with the property of the fog material of the object  it's not easy to create a demo  but i'll try 
i will i personally would leave morphnormals as it is and review morphtarger like this  defines whether the material uses morphtargets  set as true to pass morphtarget attributes from the geometry to the shader  default is false  is it ok for you 
it is mostly laziness with a dash of incomplete documentation  i have some other materials that can use image based lighting with or without lights and we use  lights to control whether lights are used or not  i noticed that changing the  lights property of the mesh standard material crashed and that the documentation didn't say that  lights was read only  i was wondering what was up  can the  lights property of any of the materials be changed  or is it strictly an indicator to the renderer about whether the shader supports lights 
since i am far from being a threejs expert  i wanted to "suggest" a "quick fix"  without knowing if the problem came from the maya exporter  or if the library should handle this case  ps  i deliberately chose  return  instead of break  because the  animation  child node is the real one we want to parse and the following line should not be called  i added two more lines in the code to make sure the  id  and  name  attributes of the parent  animation  tag are set on the child  animation  tag
thanks for your answer  i will illustrate my need by an example  compare the rendering of the same generated map with normal map in world space coordinates    with sketchfab   https   sketchfab com models 387eb203b5fb4349b83fb83beb038e41  with three js   http   pf 01 lab parisdescartes fr 1357 maprender  ref savoie we can see a discontinuity of faces when we use the wrong coordinate system  in my case it's very difficult to generate normal map in space tangent because of a specific geographic modelisation  2 5d  
 westlangley i'm extending the raycaster to support instanced geometry  and invalid data is one of my test cases  is this the intended behavior  then  i come from a data engineering background where the convention is to always expect unknown values and that any operation on an unknown value yields another unknown  anything else   as best described by david winsemius  http   r 789695 n4 nabble com fortune candidate re why can t r understand if num na tt4666250 html#none   would be to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics   so it looked to me like a simple mistake  forgive me if conventions differ in this realm

yes  i have deduced the same thing  https   jsfiddle net f2lommf5 16480  adding a light and enabling shadowmap on the renderer triggers it 
i mean this 3d model https   threejs org examples #webgl_materials_matcap can i use the 3d model or other 3d models from your official examples in my journal paper 
i'm seeing if i can get a good example for you to look at  in the mean time  i've done a bit more research  and this is what i have so far  using the fragment shader option  if i modify the material normalscale to instead be   1  1  instead of  1   1   the normal map on my model works well  #13784 has a lot of good conversation about it all  and i'm trying to wrap my head around it  but i unfortunately get artifacts such as this   img width "431" alt "image" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 3408852 49971378 1ea59700 fee3 11e8 8b81 ed2691c1eede png"  if i use three buffergeometryutils computetangents  then i remove the artifacts that you see above  but i find the vertical component of the normal map needs to be flipped  just like the fragment shade does  using normalscale   if i don't flip it  it looks like this   img width "442" alt "image" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 3408852 49971652 0a15ce80 fee4 11e8 9853 c3850ec3b245 png"  so  i think i've found a solution that works  to generate the tangents via  buffergeometryutils computetangents  after the gltf mesh is loaded  and then use some custom shader code just like in your pr that uses the tangent attribute rather than fragment shader generated tangents  and then do the flip of the y component of the normal map like in the fragment shader code  the result is this   img width "463" alt "image" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 3408852 49974076 8a403200 feec 11e8 8154 c35879cf648e png"  the last seam shown is just an artifact of the texturing itself and is visible in blender as well  so i don't know if there needs to be any change in three js or not  except that the built in fragment shader tangent space function produces artifacts  i believe this has something to do with the dfdx functions  that they don't take into account the interpolation of the coordinates passed into them  maybe just for uv   and so produce artifacts when there are discontinuities in the coordinates  although i'm not completely sure  i do believe your pr would be a good addition to three js  as it would enable app developers to use the pre computed tangents instead of generating them when the gltf is loaded  saving a bit of computation time  especially for gltf files with larger vertex counts 
ok  i would like to do it

hey  i would like if it's possible  try fixing a bug   especially in javascript  or even improve the documentation   
unfortunately not  i think it's not connected to technique tag  i also tried to remove whole extra before  which loaded fine in blender and sketchup too  but sweethome3d also didn't work with this  i will try with some really simple models tommorow  cause collada exported from blender works  if i'll use something simple  then it would be easy to see differences berween the one from blender and one from threejs 
no it dooe not work  i just load https   doc babylonjs com examples  in qwebengineview when i choose a example at left  the right area is just white blank  but it does work normally in chrome

i should have been more clear   the c++ app embeds chromium in order to do what it does so it's enormous and not feasible to include here  it was just to make an initial image pass over the examples  luckily it generated a thumbnail that was acceptable for most of them but i always imagined there would be a manual pass afterwards   e g  the vr ones that do not render on my system  going forwards for new or visually updated examples  i foresaw more of this manual step  however  i realize that's going to be time consuming to get right   so that the browser size matches size of the other images for example   so i guess we do need a web based method like puppeteer  i'll take a look  as for the design  my first pass generated a page like the grid at http   threejs org but i figured you'd want to keep the examples looking the same   plus the nice benefit of being able to filter was already there

hi  level420  we used qooxdoo 5 0 2 mobile but are now on master  as far as i understood this has nothing to do with #9219  it is just about how the browser works with pointer events  chrome tries to handle swiping on his own therefore he sends a cancel event even if the user is still swiping  this can be avoided by setting the correct touch action as noted above  please also have a look at the discussion on https   github com angular material issues 10145#issuecomment 275234528 
thanks for clear answer  mit license is important  gives calmness and freedom to do what you want to do  i want to create and distribute application were one of important part is qooxdoo library with probably few changes or additions  but maybe i will be able to separate application from qooxdoo and that case lgpl will be enough  mit license would solve all my doubts and problems from the legal point of view and would change my approach  but it's not impossible that i will handle with what qooxdoo gives right now  regards

gradle is the build script  it's a combination of maven and ant  the result is the best out of these worlds  gradle is the new kid on the block  android studio is using gradle as it's build system  the new intellij ide gets massiv gradle support  http   tools android com tech docs new build system user guide everyone can write gradle plugins  for example   the android plugin controls the quite complex build process of android apk files  like jar files  on the other hand one of my gradle plugins  https   github com mikemitterer gradle texen plugin   + https   github com mikemitterer gradle texen plugin sample  allows you to generate sql files out of a template file  the other day i saw a plugin which generates pdf files out of html files  this means gradle is very flexible  very good to configure but still easy to handle  gradle has also c++ support   thats why i think it could be interesting for arduino  i think gradle could be a step to make ardunio editor independent  for example you could use intellij or eclipse as an ide  with all it's  goodies and gradle as backend to compile and upload to the arduino  regards mike ps  more about gradle  http   www gradle org learn
where can i find the file preferences txt  i'll try it but i think that yes it's recreated  i probably tried it first  2013 11 14 federico fissore notifications github com ## cordialement  m  ambroise dhenain 
the code box is a fixed height  with scroll bars  conserving 'vertical real estate' 
after ffisore cc'd madbob in i got another activation email  the timings could have been unrelated though  thanks 
the hyperlink reference ÔÚ 2014Äê02ÔÂ27ÈÕ 18 02 01 "notifications"notifications github com Ð´µÀ£º what do you mean with "link"   mdash  reply to this email directly or view it on github 
the ide must be seeing the correct cygwin1 dll in its path 
i have tried both 3 3v and 5v with pull ups and without pull ups but the problem persists  kindly share any other solution if you have any
i found found my error   the good method is to add the url of the json files with a comma     between each url   like that     boardsmanager additional urls https   adafruit github io arduino board index package_adafruit_index json https   per1234 github io ariadne bootloader package_codebendercc_ariadne bootloader_index json https   raw githubusercontent com tkjelectronics balanduino master package_tkj_balanduino_index json https   raw githubusercontent com lauszus sanguino master package_lauszus_sanguino_index json https   raw githubusercontent com damellis attiny ide 1 6 x boards manager package_damellis_attiny_index json https   raw githubusercontent com carlosefr atmega master package_carlosefr_atmega_index json now   i can see all my board   a good add for the version 1 6 5 would be the possibility to edit easily this option  
no its still apparent  have not found fix yet   
ubuntu 14 04 compiled  arduino_1_5_7_ubuntu ino  in function ‘void setup  ’  arduino_1_5_7_ubuntu 3  error  ‘internal’ was not declared in this scope ubuntu 12 10 + arduino 1 01 can compile as manual says  this trouble happened since this morning  my system was working with ubuntu 14 04  yesterday before ubuntu updated  http   www rcgroups com forums showpost php p 24783476 postcount 2492 takao
the ide version i was using was 1 5 7   here  https   github com arduino arduino blob master libraries tft utility adafruit_gfx h#l272 275  is the link to the file  after       end scanline  the file should be closed with  img _bmpfile close     on line 274  the issue seems to be present in version 1 5 8 too 
thanks for your swift comment  i just created the elekshield ino sketch where i saw the problem in github gist  "#2354  arduino ide 1 5 8 in win7 32bits  problem with sprintf  "  thank you for looking into this problem 
importing improperly formatted   ide does not like it for whatever reason  library from windows directory where it was downloaded results in blank lines added to ino file   no #includes etc  download a zipped library  it shows up in "import library" menu   at the bottom after the separator _ as a valid library to import  now click on it and a blank line is added to your file instead of #include xxx or error indicating that zipped file cannot be imported 
ok let me restate to clarify i am using "add zip library" menu   adding fats library i receive error compiling  a library named fats already exists 1  the compiler responded "compiling"  compiling what  why  how  etc  take you best guess what needs to be done  2  the compiler responded "a library named fats already exists" the library did not existed before i used the menu "add zip" my objective was to add the library  not to do qa to see what happens when the library already exists duh  yes these are bugs  and this is an old bug also  the library is not included   no #include fats in code   when "include library" is used  only blank line s  are added to  ino file 
when the complex character is input  then a gray block box will be appeared at the below couple of lines from the current input line  during inputting at the 12 line  gray blocks are appeared at the 15th line in this attached picture    arduino_korean_ide3  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9634845 4973481 b3668d5e 68ba 11e4 8f8c 24fb99d05e5b png  i believe this problem would be caused by the error of "getcaretlocation"
its working again now  i should have saved a copy of the package_index json from 8 hours aga  when it only contained the avr stuf i suspect someone has silently fixed this by updating the packages file this a bit concerning really  i don't like the way its constantly dialing home and getting a new version of this file without alerting the user i know this is very common for loads of commercial apps etc  where they treat the users like sheep  but for technical   makers  i think that this is a retrograde step  as it means they are not really in control of an installation after its been installed  as the ide is likely to dial home and decide it wants to remove a board etc that is already installed 
yup they do  other apps like minecraft  don't judge me  work fine 
well  simply indicating  "it can support up to 12 bit adc    12 10 bit      pwm and 10 bit dac resolutions   "
 apollon77 well  i just did _chmod 777  run lock_ but it's a little strange because i already did this before  when downloading former versions of the ide
windows 8  and no 1 6 0 nightly build 
according to the  spec  http   people freedesktop org  hughsient appdata    it would normally go to   usr share appdata arduino appdata xml  but since arduino zip files are not packages that are installed into the system by a package manager i think it's not really specified  close to  desktop template  would probably make sense  the user or some script acting on behalf of the user will then be able to copy it from there and install it in the system 
i had replaced v1 6 0 back to v1 0 6 and continued with programming my little test project  i did save the problem program though  so i made a simple program to try to demonstrate the problem    #include  rhreliabledatagram h     include radiohead library #include  rh_nrf24 h     more radiohead #include  spi h  #include  dht h  #include  u8glib h     graphics library for oled    char tmpstr 18    ""     declaring here works in v1 6 0 void setup     char tmpstr 18    ""     declaring here this way does not work in v1 6 0   char tmpstr 18    "123456789012345678"     declaring here this way works in v1 6 0 int counter   1  serial begin 9600   serial println tmpstr   do   sprintf tmpstr  "counter    d"  counter++   serial println tmpstr   delay 2000     while   counter    50      void loop          re installed v1 6 0  and the simple program worked fine  i then retested the problem program  and it still has the problem  i then tested the program i continued editing in v1 0 6  removing my debug serial println's   and it works fine  very interesting  i may have changed something as i was continue editing  trying to simplify some code   but the way i declared 'tmpstr' and used it had not changed  i don't know  can't explain it  but it is working  so i guess this can be closed 
actually the boards are old freeduinos  diecimila atmega328    using a ftdi chip  1 year ago  when i started with arduinos from the scratch  i had to install the ftdi drivers  and then it worked  ide 0 9 and or 1 05  diecimila board  win xp32    but then i started to use megas und dues and the freeduinos were sort of forgotten  now i reactivated them in order to make a uart to i2c converter  but it didn't work no more  ide 1 6 3  still win xp32  i even installed a new ftdi driver manually from http   www arexx com downloads cdmv2 10 00__pid_fix zip   but no changes  when i target diecimila  i get the error as shown above  when i target unos  then it says the avrdude is out of sync  so what should i do  how can i try this  f thing  
i did  and i'm not sure why it didn't work right from the start  wiring was always cross checked  maybe a intermittent contact failure in the pin header contact though  first idea was about a driver issue because of the other wire1 issues i already had reported and which are still defective on either due 
hi  here is a link to the libraries used  http   redbearlab com getting started blendmicro http   redbearlab com getting started blendmicro under software checklist  here is the code i was trying to compile  i tried with older arduino version 1 0 5 and that compiles  regards  hannes
it must be a problem with the arduino tiny core as it works with an uno as well as  damellis attiny core  bizarrely enough eeprom wasn't showing in examples or "include library" until i successfully built it with the uno  now its showing up  the ide was also running incredibly slowly for a while  now its fine  is there some sort of caching or downloads going on   p s  why have we changed the arduino version string  it used to just remove the dots  now its zero padding too  shouldn't it be   darduino 163   
i looked at it again  i guess i had a different compiler error to cause me to assume it didnt work  nevermind 
the problem fixed itself on tue  may 26  2015 at 3 50 am  federico fissore notifications github com wrote 
1 6 4   but it seems that it was a permissions issue  i ran sudo chown root admin arduino app which resolved the issue
the new board entry is this   i copied this from a teensy boards txt  although that boards txt doesn't work at all  default boards work  just not teensy defined boards  it would also be nice to have some sort of clean fail mechanism in place for this  maybe have the program pop up an error dialog  or at least write _something_ to log instead of being totally silent about the error edit  forgot to say that i also got some info from the stock boards txt
 image  billede indsat i tekst 1   image  billede indsat i tekst 2   image  billede indsat i tekst 3  and so on for 10 more screens   all that i ignored    however the ide works so i ques that it's something local problem with my pc setup     2015 06 22 16 43 gmt+02 00 federico fissore notifications github com  ## bs
hi mattthijs  here is the entire file  thanks  graham
all fixed and committed back

yes  stop de data from printing  or a pause button which can also work i suppose 
just checked with hourly build  2 february 2016 10 15 23 gmt    same results 
thanks  i believe it has  it came up initially stating arduino cannot run because it could not create a folder to store your sketchbook  but that was due to permissions on the folder  modified and the application ran successfully 
note  the board is the   zero   and   leonardo     not the due  which accelerometer did you test with  this is specifically the mpu6050 i haven't tried with any other imu  i'll update with the full  net code for the serial output later 
i think it is a recent version  i downloaded it about three months ago  the aur package directory has a file named  arduino 1 1 6 8 2 x86_64 pkg tar xz  and one named  arduino 1 6 8 linux64 tar xz  
 facchinm thanks for the update    appreciate the work you guys do  i feel that coming up with some kind of a standard for writing libraries board files should be adopted  if it isn't already   if it already exists  it doesn't seem to be up to the mark  it should include uninstall upgrade guidelines  otherwise  these kind of issues will keep coming up in the future  as you make changes to arduino 
both the already well documented issue  a trace of the faulty code's debug output  plus a trace of the proposed replacement code   and a fully commented explanation inside the old code  that easily proves the current code is embarrassingly incorrect  that seems like a slam dunk  but went nowhere in the 9 days  sorry  my "weeks" claim was from my obviously poor memory   i didn't know whether it had got on someone's list or not  the issue that caused me to open this thread was a similarly incorrect piece of code  including a line that does _not_ comply with recommended practice in the reference     "attachinterrupt 1  " compared to      "attachinterrupt digitalpintointerrupt interruptpin   "  this approach is designed to be board independent  and a tutorial has _no_ idea what board the tutorial code will be run on  as a newbie  new eyes   i have noticed quite a few of these that just aren't right  my personal reaction is that there are too many  only my value judgment  issues  either coding faults  poor standards  failure to comply with standards etcetera   my perspective is that if things are in tutorials  to help newbies like me  then they should at least me correct  but  i'm sorry that i have to say  that from what i have seen  and the timeline painted by 'matthijskooijman'  correctness doesn't seem like something that is high on the priority list  yes  i realise this is a volunteer organisation  but 'volunteer' doesn't have to equate to faulty and not according to recommended practices  if we only aspire to be sub standard  we miss an opportunity to 'go for the gold'  sorry  the 2016 olympics have just finished   nobody likes the latest member telling them that there are issues  so i will stop bothering people  this thread can now be closed in the appropriate manner  by whomever is appropriate 
v1 6 9 i originally noticed the error in the arduino tutorials section  here   https   www arduino cc en tutorial debounce then was reminded that it's also an example provided with the ide  edit  i should add that i did check  and the same example is provided with ide v1 6 11  and still has the same error 
i'm used these versions today on downloads directory ed in  applications directory  versions tested are  1 6 10  1 6 11  1 6 11 nightly
it isn't a shield per se   http   www carobot cc how to tinkerkit tutorials tinkerkit tutorial lcd 06 twi   url  the only thing that could be removed is the lcd itself  it worked fine on both create and the ide about a week ago  there are also a couple of mentions of leo issues in the forum recently hence my supposition that its builder related or something that has changed in that area  am going to try an earlier ide shortly from an unzipped locations and will report back 
yes  thank you    though pert has already clarified this  on the forum  http   forum arduino cc index php topic 477052 msg3260554#msg3260554

hi  as requested  i've tried running arduinoota from a terminal session and it throws the same error  with no command line parameters   compilation 
thanks facchinm  yes  looks good to me  ultimately  i wish that the jmdns service had some tuning options so the ttl could be set without the dns property  but this will definitely help with packet flooding  i'll pull this version and give it a try    kurt
this needs to be changed for several reasons… the datasheet for the atmega2560 says you can get a pwm output from timer1c  oc1c  on that pin therefore you should be able to do so and as far as i can tell it is impossible to do that without this change  that alone should be reason for the change  people will design their pcb and pin assignment assuming they can do that and others should not have to subsequently waste the hours i have trying to find the bug in bug free code or redesign their project just because the device is crippled by some easily corrected omission in a file  however if that is not enough reason for you… not all timers are equal  timer 0 is 8 bit  timer 1 is 16 bit  consequently they require different setups and different values sent to them to obtain the same duty cycle  that is a lot of unnecessary effort to force people to go to for the sake of such a quick and simple change to a file  thus using timer0  particularly when trying to drive a 3 phase motor is somewhat unhelpful because… a  being driven from a separate timer to the other two phases mean the phases will not be in sync  unlike generating all three phases from a single timer  this will result in a small amount of undesired braking of the motor resulting in loss of energy speed  back emf spikes and a small amount of jitter in the motors rotation  b  other people like me may want need to use the micros and or millis commands from the timer h include  which clearly indicates it uses timer0 and not to use timer0 for anything else as it can mess up returned values  thus using timer0 is not always a suitable alternative because it is not the same thing  analogwrite  i am glad you mentioned analogwrite in your reply as that also requires some modification in my opinion… to write that command in a way that 255 is a special case and always result in 100  duty cycle in a pwm signal was rather short sighted even if 8 bit timers were only available at the time as is assumes top will always be 255 which is not necessarily the case as it may be set to a value lower value to facilitate a pwm frequency that is different from the default  for 16 bit timers where top may be  as in my case set to 400 to produce a 20khz pwm signal the special case for 255 creates a problem that then has to be worked around as otherwise it results in 100  duty cycle at a time when that is not what you want  consequently either the special case for 100  duty cycle should be removed and all non zero values treated the same or the special case for 100  should take its value from that set by a new "  analogwritetop  " command so that it works correctly for values other than 255  regards  stephen
yes  tools port lists 15 ports  mostly from usb devices like mobiles or 3g modems  
who is paying for my 4 hours of wasted time on version 1 8 5      i thought 1 8 5 was stable  that's the one that is released on your website https   www arduino cc en main software are you telling us  you didn't test this version before releasing to users  i am using windows 10  i also tried the beta version  and the same error occurred  there is no anti virus software interfering  and if it did wouldn't it give some type of warning to allow running  please advise what these errors mean  and how to work around it  on mon  may 14  2018 at 2 23 pm  paul stoffregen  notifications github com  wrote                           straight from     the sharpshooter sharper1999 gmail com                       arduino  1 8 6 hourly build 2018 05 10 01 33  windows 10   board  "arduino genuino uno" sketch uses 2492 bytes  7   of program storage space  maximum is 32256 bytes  global variables use 208 bytes  10   of dynamic memory  leaving 1840 bytes for local variables  maximum is 2048 bytes  java io ioexception  cannot run program " runtime tools avrdude path  bin avrdude"  createprocess error 2  the system cannot find the file specified caused by  java io ioexception  createprocess error 2  the system cannot find the file specified     8 more an error occurred while uploading the sketch this report would have more information with "show verbose output during compilation" option enabled in file    preferences 
that's perfect    +1  thank you for your quick reply   now i will wait for the 1 8 6 release  i hope that it will come soon    
sure  just tried it with 1 8 6 hourly build 2018 07 11 and it shows the same  unusual behaviour  this might be no big deal for many users  but some  like me  have 10 or more windows from all different applications open at the same time on the same virtual desktop  to change apps i always use cmd tab and then switch through the windows of one app with cmd backquote  if the latter only toggles between the last two windows i would have no way to get to ide windows that are buried any deeper except for moving all the other windows to the side until i can find and click focus on the one i need  that's because there is also no window selector option in the top ribbon command list  like you would find on software like bbedit  skype or firefox 
hi  facchinm here i am i do load a source  make a change  export binaries in the project directory  the ino always has its original date which is different from the compilation date of the binaries  at the moment  i work with 1 8 7 in win10 64   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 43587190 47656125 c6167680 db8e 11e8 94f8 1c2adc49f547 png  have modified source  make binaire  time stamp no change in source and flag not too   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 43587190 47656349 34f3cf80 db8f 11e8 8107 49ce2a3488eb png  how does the compiler generate the binary if the source is not backed up before 
it was through the library manager  also maybe could be useful  i modified preferences file  adding the line to change the   hex file generated after been compiled to another folder and be able to simulate arduino uno using proteus  i just look into my arduino projects folder and nothing is there    i used to have     arduino test  sketches and simulations      arduino documentacion  documents and datasheets      arduino simon  main project  i used to make my drafts in test folder  when something was ok  i save into simon folder  but now nothing is there  just "core" "libraries" "preproc" "sketch" and "test" folders but inside test is just the   ino file el sáb   3 de nov  de 2018 10 35  daniel  notifications github com  escribió

i installed the folder for linux and ran install sh script  i could not remember from which version i upgraded from  i updated to the latest  i installed esp32 boards using https   github com espressif arduino esp32 blob master docs arduino ide debian_ubuntu md
command line    i'll work to pursue this suggestion and report back on that  hanging in my other report    i had no problem when compiling for a huzzah8266 and wemos d1 mini  this also supports your suggestion that i should report it to the esp32 repo  thanks for your questions and time

2 0 1  i believe  at least  i upgraded today  i can confirm when i get to work  i can also test with a local database vs remote  any idea about node mysql2 
i think you're right  i assume underscore is cycling through the keys of the source object and just assigning values regardless of whether or not the corresponding value is undefined  the code that wrapped sequelize in our case is being patched  but perhaps sequelize should produce a proper error when dialect is nothing  i dug into sequelize js to find out what was going wrong after node reported  no module named   dialects undefined   which was unhelpful 
i was using  1 7 0 beta8   updating to  1 7 0 rc2  fixed it 
i updated my post  yes  i select the id but it is not returned somehow 
when i run the query manually in mysql workbench then the result seems correct  not sure how you guys map the result but it returns the following attributes  id  make  color  person  person id  person name when i log the not stringified result i find some trails of the relationship   it returns  fct   function   and the stringified result of that is just an empty object    
sorry     done   
here are the relevant pieces of my code   the occcheck   function creates a 2nd connection instance which  based on the code i first posted  will always use the default maxidletime  if you run this and wait longer than the default maxidletime before pressing "enter" to continue  you'll see it complete without error  however  in the database  you'll see that the data wasn't updated 
yes  i am not expecting sequelize to be as fast as pure node mysql  but i was thinking of 20 30  max overhead  not about 100     the version i am using is 2 0 0 dev1  thanks  angel

update on post 
for a fairly decent treatment of the topic  http   stackoverflow com questions 8263371 how prepared statements can protect from sql injection attacks this node library implements prepared statement support  https   github com sidorares node mysql2 the main gist here is that you are passing a 'template' to the server first and then you are passing the parameters to be used within the template separately  as a result  there is 0  chance of the server  assuming it is handling its arguments correctly  misinterpreting a value in a bound parameter as an instruction that should be executed as part of the template  any library that implements parameter escaping instead is inherently less secure as it is possible that malicious 'instructions' could be inserted into the string that is ultimately passed to the server

my transaction item table already has an association to users based on a field called user_id  my transaction item table already has a field  and populated  called provider  what i need to do is associate the provider as well as the user back to the users table  sample transacionitem record  user_id on transactionitem is set to 1 for a user name leillc net provider on transcationtem is set to 12 for a provider of hagen  note  all the fields already existed so i changed the model for transcationitem to this  associate  function  models     but it does not grab the provider information from the user table 
sure   you want the whole output  it's pretty big  or is there any field in particular you are looking for

uh  try it  sorry  but your answer doesn't make sense  here's some more detail 
 janmeier i'm on 2 0 0 rc3
"columnname" varchar n   
 janmeier it does creates the correct constraints  the point is i'm using 'ondelete'  cascade with hooks  true  this should call the hooks for each object  so the correct is to destroy everything without needing to use the database constraint  i added the  constraints  false  so it  constraints  doesn't get created on database to be simpler to notice what i'm talking about  if you create the tables without the constraints as i told you  the model4 object will not be removed from the database but it should since i'm using hooks  true  from docs   however  addinghooks  true explicitly tells sequelize that optimization is not of your concern and will perform aselecton the associated objects and destroy each instance one by one in order to be able to call the hooks with the right parameters  
the stats i have atm    run time from  14 dec 18 37 27 to 15 dec 06 53 03 from the output log i counted the  begin transaction  from the  executing  uber duper thingy hash   begin transaction   i see 1012 transaction   edit   run time to 15 dec 12 21 28 the error started on 15 dec 06 53 03 everything else runs fine but whenever it needs to write to db it outputs that error messagem no changes made to db and the app moves on
you bet  let me work that up 
yes  thanks for asking     there were some tables that got created on a previous run of  sync  force  true    which were triggering the error because they had keys that referenced the recreated tables  once i deleted the database by hand  and sync ran again  everything went back to normal  it took me a while  since i assumed that using  sync  force  true    would create the db from scratch  and the logged create table statements looked perfectly fine  that  together with the fact that sqlite cli has foreign keys disabled by default  got me through the wrong track    
which way i could check the transaction status outside of hooks 
i am using sequelize 2 0 0 rc2 
sorry  i made a mistake on my first post  i have already updated it  before update the value is 0  i'm working on the latest versión
yes i did  its not showed in the code above but i did  on jan 21  2015 1 43 pm  "mick hansen" notifications github com wrote 
 janmeier i'm using "mysql"  " 2 5 4" in my package json
yes i change the taggable for collectable and the error persist this is my query  i'm using sequelize 2 1 3
 janmeier  "sequelize"  " 2 0 0 rc8" 
same versions are installed  "sequelize"  "2 0 0 rc1"  "sequelize cli"  "1 1 0" 
yeah  i think there's a little error in the doc   model update  username  'toni'     where   accesslevel  0     individualhooks  true    it should be  model update  username  'toni'     where   accesslevel  0   individualhooks  true     it works for me   +1 
 janmeier actually this is not sequelize problem  i'm using vagrant  and firstly made mistake in method name  sheckpassword   but this file wasn't updated correctly  anyway  thanks for help  actually i have another question   is there simple way to update password on  create  and  update   instead of just  create   without creating second listener 
sequelize 3 2 0 – bluebird  2 9 24 sequelize 3 14 2 – bluebird 3 0 6 i noticed the problem in one of our test suites  which did timeout instead of failing with an error 
i am using v2 0 3  tried it again and it still doesn't work on mine  the sql query being generated are  paranoid   false
i am using sequelize 2 0 0 here's the post model definition  let me know if you need the others 
sorry  should have included that to begin with  package json says  "version"  "2 0 4" i just updated to 2 0 5 and still get the error
because i want auto generate unique key as youtube link  ep2yovqoy4y   https   www youtube com watch v ep2yovqoy4y and unique key must 6 character  on beforecreate  because query in sequelize is async and while checkuniquekey        incorrect
 mickhansen initially i tried with  define 'name'  attributes   schema  'users'    same error 
hi  janmeier  thanks for the quick response  in both cases    role  ''   and   role  'something'    the new row is inserted successfully

 mickhansen
 mickhansen ugh  mark this one invalid  the error was being thrown by an id validator before hook in the project  github issues needs the equivalent of a "drunk text blocker"  except for sleep deprived devs  that way bleary eyed people like myself don't waste everyone's time  my apologies 
because one of the columns can be null  and primary keys can't have nulls  in my use case i do not use the "id" attribute  but since it will solve this problem  i will probably add it just to solve this  if i use the "getassociationns" function  it returns both children  so i was wondering why the eager load option did not work 
yes  that seems to work  thanks 
so it looks like it's a passport thing as  req user instanceof user instance  returns  false   thanks for the fast reply 
oh of course  sorry   here you go   i've omitted some unnecessary functions and properties 
thanks for the link  janmeier  will work on a pull request if my team ends up using sequelize for our project 
i am not sure if i use the correct way to define datatype    i did like shown here  http   docs sequelizejs com en latest docs models definition    this is my model definition 
how can it be changed  on thu  oct 1  2015 at 6 35 pm  jan aagaard meier notifications github com wrote

sorry about my english  let me try to explain it better  i have an online database  mysql  from where i will read the data and a local database  sqlite  where i will store this data for offline use if necessary  my doubt is if  with some sequelize function i can do that synchronization  i hope i have been able to explain now  thank you very much
i managed to do a reduced test case and it actually seems to work   that doesn't create the foreign key  i'll close this and sorry for wasting your time 
 papb referenceid is a foreign key and not purchase id  so  the result is an array of multiple purchases  ad orderby  my turnaround is to use   i think this should be reopened 
it is an array of  expenses 
closing as this was down to my misunderstanding of sequelize  answer provided on the stackoverflow question helped greatly 
fwiw  it seems like order matters as well    scope  'defaultscope'  'otherscope'    mutates the defaultscope  but   scope  'otherscope'  'defaultscope'    does not 
it's not that we have 2 tables with the same name  we have 2 models that are each bound to the same table  this is a very common scenario when you have a common table in the db with a discriminator column
it is quite impossible for me to give you any live demo to access or compile anything at the moment   yes but i can elaborate more i have tables in mysql posts reply likes post has replationship has many to reply reply has relationship has many to likes so in posts model i have  so it works fine if i have a at least one reply for a post if post has no reply then it start giving me error "cannot read property 'push' of undefined" so it looks like hasmany for like does not work on reply if reply has null or empty values   i want to tell you i am using count in like attributes other wise it works fine if i fetch all records from like table instead of total count
 generatetransactionid    is just a uuidv4 generator  no side effect  just could cause future confusion about setting  this id  
 papb thanks for replying  right  actually  i try to find an easy way to do things like this  users and folders have many to many relationship  folders and articles also have many to many relationship  when a user delete a folder  the record in two through tables  userfolder  guidefolder  and the record in folder table are deleted  as well as all records in guide table which belong to the folder  since folders and articles have many to many relationship  i think  ondelete  'cascade'  hooks  true  can remove all the articles belong to the folder when  folder destroy    triggers  i wonder if there is a method can be simple like this   or could you provide an example to achieve 
i thought it was very helpful  i was a little confused if i should be making something that fails the ci check to show the bug in action  also i wasn't sure what exactly to link to    i settled on the pr which i think is what was intended  also i'm not sure if i'm supposed to do anything to delete or close that pr or if you all will handle that  i'm assuming i should leave my fork up for some time too  thanks 
 kaizoku kenshin nope  tried just about everything i could think of  but i haven't figured it out yet 
typo  i meant to say that  model scope  a  b    is not equal to  model scope  b  a    because sequelize overrides duplicated properties in the where clause  i would have preferred that the order of scopes should not matter  however  on second thought  even if this feature request was completed and merged  the above would still not be true because things outside the where and include clause are still overwritten  so ignore this bit 
 papb i am using sequelize v5   "sequelize"  " 5 21 3"   does documentation for v6 also apply to v5 
no  instead i used raw query  i think that is the only option to execute 'distinct' key word for myql in sequelize
hi  papb for now  it will fix the issue  ideally  we also want to set a correct precision value as per the comment in the code  https   github com sequelize sequelize blob c845f0bc4f2a51fe681a271845f22f5673725b69 lib dialects mssql query js#l36

 njsmith what i mean by not aligned memory  is that in the master the ndarray flag aligned is false  when it is true in 1 6 1  theano do not support not aligned ndarray  so we automatically check this flag and automatically raise an error when we see one  i suppose the not initiailized strides cause a function that check if the ndarray is aligned or not to think it isn't aligned  this bring the question  should the function that compute the align flag be updated to ignore the strides of dimensions of 1   seberg i think gh 2950 should fix my problem  thanks

sorry about that  yep  no leak in numpy 1 7 1 
i guess you could what i'm missing is a numpy dtype equivalent of python's builtin  none   such that  none  could be stored and recovered while not being recognized as a generic object type but with a builtin numpy type  but i guess this would mean a major change in deep internals in numpy  so i guess this has to be closed as a won't fix  i'm using npz to serialize semi complex python objects that have considerable amounts of processed data in it  various numpy arrays  and then some parameter settings  can be strings  bools  ints floats  booleans  none values  into a single npz file  but i guess i can work around it with some minor added logic during de serialization 
just checked  it also fails for 32 bit integers   also segfaults  the machine has 256gb ram  i e  more than enough 
strangely enough  when i do a clean install of 1 9 1 on a machine running ubuntu 12 04  i continue to have the same problem  however  i tested a clean install of 1 9 1 on ubuntu 14 10 and did not encounter the error  just to verify that the install process on 12 04 was working ok  i did a clean install of 1 8 1 on ubuntu 12 04  and then my problem went away 
problem is fixed so i'm closing the issue  thanks again 
yes  certainly using a "nonsensical" equality function would give nonsensical results  perhaps a big fat warning telling to not use anything but  np isclose  and friends  the case i was more interested in was issues with floating point equality  typically
using python 2 7 3  don't have access to upgrade it  i will see if i can talk to the it to get it upgraded  thanks 
 rgommers  i would appreciate if you could do it  i will not have access to computers with good bandwidth for a few days   juliantaylor  it's 32 bits and big endian  similar to mips  mipseb   i don't know many details about the architecture  but a person with more knowledge of this told me  see link to debian bug report at the start of this thread  that the implementation details provided for other arches should work for this one  i will forward the questions to him just in case  but if you don't receive more info about this  assume that the provided patch is enough  thanks 
yeah  it's the last gplv2 version of gcc and since openbsd doesn't accept gplv3 in the base system it's what we have   llvm may come in the future   there are more modern versions of gcc in the package ports system but it created a dependency on building a compiler just to build numpy which is not a first choice  so    i will test your suggestion overnight as i'm not at a computer rest of the day unfortunately  thanks for taking a look 
yes  it is  sometimes my code will produce 5 687138413593e+03  it is ok but when the exponent number larger than hundred or less than minus hundred  it will become 3 14 114  it is the default output in fortran

this is _definitely_ a real world problem  we found it while trying to diagnose performance issues in a fits image reader maintained by  esheldon here https   github com esheldon fitsio  this reader is used by a non trivial segment of the astronomy community  see this issue https   github com esheldon fitsio issues 58 for the thread  also reference above   furthermore   esheldon found that the fitsio test suite  which performs typical operations done with fits files  has a similar performance degradation   esheldon might be able to comment as well 
  i forgot to mention that the isolated command  python  c "from distutils import ccompiler"  succeeds    you're right  in fact i can import  ccompiler  from  distutils  but it uses the system one  this happens probably because  distutils  are not part of  site packages   they reside directly in   usr lib64 python2 7  in my case  and thus not excluded from the virtualenv  any recommendation how to work around this issue  there does not seem to be anything keeping the package from working  but it would be nice if all tests would succeed 
numpy was installed via pip 
my numpy 1 14 was build by this  https   aur archlinux org cgit aur git tree  h python numpy mkl then  i tried to build  scipy with mkl  https   aur archlinux org cgit aur git tree  h python scipy mkl  and got that error but the same error raises when i import  distutils  and try get the version manually 
i checked 1 11 but the git master branch looks the same

yes  import error is "cannot import name 'multiarray' " however once i removed "cpython 35m darwin" another error occured "cannot import name 'umath' " while umath module name is also of "cpython 35m darwin" 
the matrix u  v columns 2  3 are switched or the manual is not correct
i see this issue going back as far as numpy 1 9 0  i didn't test before that as there were no wheels for 3 5
when  d_large_files is added they all go away  no output to stdout stderr at all  it was "easy" to find because i see saw it frequently when packaging for aix  i cannot find a quick link  but back in aix 4 2  1996 1997  support for large file systems was added  then up to 64g from memory  and in aix 4 3 3 and the first release of the 64 bit kernel  1998  _large_files were added  the way it was done was to let even 32 bit applications have access to large_files  although the define has been around for years  it is not as well known as it should be  the statement above  without _large_files  shows  guessing  that configure has added several large_file related flags   but not the key one for aix  i am going to try "exporting" cflags " d_large_files" and see if the build process adds them on to the command  fingers crossed 
i need "how"  you give "why"  please give your help to others 
i figured there would need to be discussion beforehand  should i email numpy discussion or scipy dev 
hi njsmith  thanks for your information this issue is resolved 
 carletes thanks very much for your quick feedback  1  i am using the latest theano and latest numpy  2  you suggest report this issue to theano team  and the issue is  "theano hasn't kept up with deprecationwarnings and futurewarnings  in particular using floats as indexes and implicit casting of float32 to int32"  right  3  besides this issue of the theano  is there anything else issue caused by theano  because there are about 9 errors and 6 fail 
yes and no   clang on freebsd 11 0 is 3 8 0  so assuming clang 3 4 1 predates __builtin_cpu_supports support  which is entirely possible   how does the extension even compile with it  perhaps the code that uses is behind an #ifdef and isn't being reached  but if so  then why the link error  clang is the default compiler on freebsd and it is almost certain it is used to build their binary package for python 2 7  is it possible that at least part of the bug is because numpy is expecting __cpu_model to be there already in the runtime library loaded for python 2 7 and due to the "official" clang being used to build that  it isn't  thanks

sorry  yes the error i posted is from version 1 11 1  i still get the error sometimes with 1 12 1 though  i'm trying to reproduce it now so i can show that error message 
i'd be happy if this issue could be somehow resolved  the proposed solution seems pretty straight forward imho  i'd also like to point out that this bug still exists in version 1 13  thanks 
 charris  bashtage  r   np random randomstate 1   has to be passed around for every time a random function is to be called afaik  in my use real usecase  i have callbacks given to workers by the user  and those callbacks likely use  numpy random  functions  i don't want the user  callback provider  to see a difference when their callbacks are called in a concurrent mode or in single process mode  if i'm to use  r   nupmy random randomstate seed    i have to pass it to the callbacks and the user will need to inconveniently pass it too to all downstream functions as an argument  setting the process global seed via  numpy seed  seems like the way to go in my case and there's no reason for it not to work 
i try to compile newdtype_example but get errors   it seems that python3 changes its c api  so this code doesn't work
thanks  no  i always get the error  regardless of the     a 0   bit 
yes  the platform does seem to matter  i just ran my code on a linux  ubuntu 14 04 lts  anaconda install of numpy 1 13 0  and could not reproduce the behaviour  is there anything i can do to help pinpoint the problem 
well  as the array is empty  the type shouldn't matter 
my mistake  i have a docker file with  pip install numpy  and i was ending up with 1 14 0rc1  it turns out a preceding build for a different package was pulling in the release candidate 
thank you all for checking  i am compiling using intel compiler  and compiling with   o3   pytest calls crashes 3 out of 4 times  but my stand alone example crashes every time i tried  i will report my findings here 
just tried 1 13 3  same problem   i used a hacked up  test_rational c src  from head  however  has this changed recently  
i believe so  as the regex expression would just need to match   numpy   or   numpy   
thanks  i installed numpy from a wheel on the same mac  and i don't see this odd behavior  i also don't see this odd behavior on a linux box using the same version of numpy from anaconda  so perhaps this is a mac os   anaconda problem 
that solve my problem  i leave gcc only in one folder an made a new compilation  thanks 
hi guys thanks for the answers  i see  i would actually never have guessed this functionality is too high level for numpy  i thought it was a key functionality for matrix manipulations  i ended up using  cv2 resize     which i guess is a similar approach as using  scipy ndimage   not sure if those allow for 3  dimensions  but the main use case i can think of is 3d images anyway  maybe it is an option to allow for an interpolation bool or string argument within the  np resize     with the default being "" or  false  and reverting to legacy functionality  but when non empty it crosslinks to  scipy ndimage   somebody with interpolation goals would probably catch that  check the docs as to which flags can be passed to the argument  and not get confused  i am unfamiliar however if and when crosslinking is acceptable coding practice  disregarding all that  not sure if a warning in the docs would have caught my attention  but it might sure do so for others  will make a pr 
this was the version of numpy which was installed on the systems where this issue was first identified  https   repo anaconda com pkgs main linux 64 numpy 1 15 1 py36h1d66e8a_0 tar bz2 more details can be provided upon request on what additional versions of numpy were used to demonstrate differences  i do know versions of numpy with mkl  with openblas  and other variants were checked to verify that these differences could be reproduced 
in the context where this was identified  the histogram function is called on an array that represents an image  occasionally this image may be boolean  as it represents either a segmentation or a mask  that usecase seems reasonable to me  but i may be misunderstanding the purpose of  histogram  
as mentioned above  a minimal approach would be to document the expected behavior better 
i am using conda 4 5 11  python 3 6 6  numpy 1 15 3

 mattip i've checked 1 16 1     same problem   charris archlinux

this already has been discussed with ralf gommers and julian taylor  who suggested available developers  of course  anyone is welcome to work on the issue and claim the financial bounty 
i installed it with snap  from snap list i get the following input     pypy3 5 10 1 31 stable pypyproject classic     install pip for pypy3 and then installed numpy with its pip install

 seberg thanks  each process in the pool read csv data  process it  and then write another csv file  it's only a few that sometime are bigger than others  i fact  i use pandas for that  the trick is  the data read are about at most 5mb  the last resulting csv is  500mb  i didn't thought that pandas with numpy should eat like 2gb for concatenating  some other dataset could generate a bit bigger file  but resulting data is not much than this one  i think i simply over simplify the mechanism of pandas to do stuff  and a bit more cool with the memory  so i jump to parallelise my code  and beem  in space  i'm curious about this caching stuff  is that memory reusable by other stuff than pandas+numpy object at the end  because here  keep  681mb for caching to maybe optimise later stuff is still serious if it's not reusable reused in the script itself  and what about other process running at the same time that could be exhausted because one long script just eat the memory at one point  but only for a few seconds  i mean  if you need to create a script that call multiple subscript in shell  as so when the script is done it freeup this cache  it seriously not easy to write such thing all the time  and i thing it's a bit against the scripting principle with automatic management  here i expressly ask for garbage collection  after deleting it  should i unload numpy as well to say i'm done with such objects  you can free up everything instead of bazookating the python interpreter itself  maybe i simply prefer c where i control those stuff   
 google colab  https   colab research google com  comes with tensorflow installed and also allows    pip  stuff    so you should be able to adjust your environment as needed  it's free but requires a google account  will that work for you

i think butterfly summation    pairwise summation    parallel sum scan  just different names for the same thing   if there is any remaining doubt  the technique i am referring to is described extensively for cuda here  https   developer nvidia com gpugems gpugems3 gpugems3_ch39 html   this same approach should work quite well and be reasonably efficient for cpu  but some care will have to be taken to make sure the algorithm uses the cache structure efficiently  or you'll end up with something that scales like log2 memcpy ops    np sum  is clearly using something like this  but  np cumsum  is clearly not  see example above   this is particularly problematic when summing large arrays of similar magnitude numbers in low precision  e g    float32

interesting  thanks for pointing this out  i think what is happening is that while on vs code i use the keyboard to run via the extension  code runner  https   marketplace visualstudio com items itemname formulahendry code runner   which caused the error above  but when activating python in the terminal or running with  python readcsv py  it works  so i believe you're right that the problem is code runner not knowing how to activate my conda environment  no idea how to actually solve that problem but the work around is to not use code runner

my problem is that it happens inconsistently and i haven't been able to figure out an iron clad way of reproducing it  my thought is that is is a race condition of some sort   i'll watch our app and pull one together if i find exactly under what conditions it happen  i take it that there is no clear workaround to make angular ignore certain routes   ideally with a wildcard option 
hi  jeffbcross  the scenario is as follows  change country dropdown to one of the countries  then change the first dropdown to "opt1" option  which will change the list of countries available   you would notice that filter country is still holding the old value it had while countries dropdown resets to "all countries"  i have tested it against 1 2 19 on chrome on both ubuntu and windows  behavior remains the same 
in my case  it used to work with older versions  i hadn't tested this particular function in a while  so i don't know when it stopped working  but there were other behaviors that changed in 1 0 5  so perhaps there  in any case  i can understand why i need to  apply   now  because technically the code is running outside of the controller context  in a callback for fineuploader   the details are confusing though  because i would think responding to a message broadcast is in context  and it still doesn't work without the  apply   there  maybe it's a bug  but since  apply   does the job  i am happy  especially since angular kicks ass in so many ways  on wed  may 1  2013 at 9 59 pm  aaron frost notifications github comwrote 
 lgalfaso  sorry for the confusion  rc4 didn't break this  it's been broken for some time    i'm unaware of how far back it goes  i've had this code around since before rc4 and i just had notes in there because i changed it to comply with changes to rc4  the problem persists  i'll make some changes to the plunker to indicate the problem a little bit better shortly 
what confusion do you both envision happening  i find  ng on click  in particular to be much more intuitive predictable extensible than  ng click   i get confusion happening over  ng prop     because people don't understand the attribute property distinction of the dom  also  alignment with and easing migration to angular 2 0 is only one of the arguments  the other points are true independent of what 2 0 does   i e  web components compatibility and clarity of right hand side format

hi  thanks for your reactivity  i have created http   jsfiddle net vvbvs 8  in order to set my code but i was not able to set json data for testing  the behavior locally is when i refresh the same page several times then  sometimes  scope searchvalues typeloc_id is filled and sometimes  scope searchvalues typeloc_id is unset while  scope producttypes is set with matching elements  but it seems  scope producttypes is set after the callback then  thanks 
 narretz   yes  the  templateurl  in directive should not insert the parameter  it should not be changed    otherwise i can't use local script template or  templatecache
 mhevery in some ways this is to solve an un intuitive aspect of using directives that require controllers  and as a specific example  in cases where you could not easily  and arbitrarily  wrap directives  specifically with tables  your workaround won't always be possible  from my understanding  in the case of there being a zero element repeater  the controller would still exist on the "comment" version of the transcluded directive  i would have to delve into the compiler code to see whether the timing of all of this makes that true  which i don't have time to do right now   but since by the time you get to the linking function your  element already has its controller on its data i would assume that instantiating the controller for a directive is done post compile  pre linking 
seems i cannot reproduce this problem any more  not sure if it's my problem or it got fixed  anyway thanks for looking into this  pkozlowski opensource

 narretz oh my    that means some other unexpected things may happen  anyway  i'm impressed this does work with that many jasmine 2 x versions released without much intention to make it work with them   gkalpak that's what i think may be dangerous for some reason  i assume what has been done and is there now is not a mistake but it has been done this way for a reason  i just can't figure out what proper prototype chain may break  and from my experience messing around with error objects may decrease angular users  i e  developers  experience  for example chrome started truncation message once  it took them 4 or 5 releases to track why messages got truncated without the ability to expand them on demand    browsers are very liberal in term of how to treat error instances  all in all it's a host object  and here we're trying to add something when it's not officially supported  that's why i'm not submitting a pr yet

hmm  don't think i can put up hole app in a plunker demo  but i will try to figure out why its getting there i have a virtual machine with ie8 so i can debug this future 
after a couple hours of pulling my hair out  i figured it out and it is not a bug in angular  you can close this  if you are curious as to what happened  it is due to the fact that i am working on a isomorphic framework we created that allows us to render angular templates and code on the server side  in this situation the issue is that my   div my template   div   was being replaced on the server side  so  when angular bootstrapped  the dom already contained the expanded   div my template ng class " blah  true " class "blah"   div    during the bootstrapping process  angular tried to replace my template again which wouldn't be an issue except that the logic for replacing will combine attributes on the main div  in this case  that mean taking ng class from the dom which was generated by the server and concatenating it together with the ng class in the client side template  thus they appeared twice   whew  thanks for looking into this and sorry to waste your time

yeah  i think it's fine to just use strings  i only brought it up because initially i had assumed that using date objects for min max would work  after a couple minutes of trying to figure out why my example wasn't working  it wasn't until i took a closer look at the documentation that i realized my assumption was incorrect

my particular scenario is that i need to have the field not be validated in any way under certain circumstances  i have a directive that evaluates an expression and determines to whether to add or remove the control from the form  it seemed easier than messing with the validate pipeline  and possibly parsers pipeline   i couldn't find a way to not validate fields besides actually removing the field from the dom  which wasn't an option 
 igorminar yes  i checked  syntax of html  http   www w3 org html wg drafts html master syntax html#attributes 0   and seems only 2 rules must be follow    no     in text   no alpha character follow by     without spaces for example    div ng show "a  b" blabla     div   and   div    a   b    b    a    blabla     div   maybe it's not worth to add new syntax for those cases  
yes   thank you again   it helpful
p s  i don't need any digest cycle in the case because it's all background stuff 
providing a method to override the entire whitelist seemed too cumbersome  the user would have to pass the entire list  also  there are multiple underlying lists that the override functions in the pr update  we'd have to supply an override function for each of these internal lists if we went down that path  if we want the ability to remove tags attributes  i would suggest creating "remove" functions in addition to the "add" functions that are in the pr

yeah  i'd be happy to  but i'm not _that_ familiar with angulars inner workings  looking at   exceptionhandlerprovider   i don't see a straight forward approach to this  as  exception  could be many things  not just an  error   which makes the interface unclear  my initial intention was to look at  minerr   which seems to produce these long urls 
 lord2800 could not figure out a way to put them directly into the cache  because i don't have controls of when ng initializes the cache  i did go down the path of trying to replace the entire templatecache provider  and managed to get it working  by just adding my own provider with the same  id    but that seems like a hack because replacing the default   templatecacheprovider  completely isn't an officially supported feature 
please try again  i was just adding a comment to the plunkr at that time  so would have been broken then  
are you sure you have set base to http   foo bar baz  with trailing slash  i get the problem in any browser with angular js 1 2 14  maybe i'll use plunker to show you the case later today 
first  sorry for not using the template  i just discoverd it now    i am using ngmocke2e  not ngmock  what else would you suggest in my specific situation  it works just fine if i add the clearbackenddefinitions definition and does exactly what i need it to do  would there be a better way 
i agree that deferred evaluation is not ideal  but as of  1 3 0 rc 4+  that's currently what's happening with all ngevents such as  ng click   i'm just recommending that  ng change  follow suit and stay consistent with all the other events  but i'm not sure what the correct delay mechanism is without going through the code a bit more  the long standing workaround i've used for both pre  and now post  1 3 0 rc 4  is to execute the code inside a   timeout  of  0  and then read the  parentform   but after seeing the  ngmodel  priority increase i didn't think it would be much more work to defer  ng change  eval just a tad by hooking it somewhere later 
thank you narretz  i have array of items  items can be added or removed  in each of item  i have 2 input select  contents of input select 2  depends on input select 1  if ngoption expression can be interpolated  i can  watch model of input select 1  and change ngoption of input select 2  based on value of input select 1  do you have any other idea to solve my problem   thank you 
thanks   matsko  that would work  for some reason i was thinking the following when i originally posted this   i was concerned about the extra  div   i now realize this could be done via   ng messages for "f gametitle  error" ng if "f gametitle  dirty"   as done here  http   codepen io anon pen cgqgf this exposes a blind spot i have with angular  how to directives work together  it has been unclear for me when both using and creating directives  are there any good resources for this 
you are correct  igorminar my problem was i missed the minor upgrade in angular mocks  this was being thrown by a unit test  sorry to have consumed your time  thanks for the suggestion on  apply  i'd prefer to avoid more  timeout flush   on our unit tests

i just want to make a good  functional  extensive directive  like for example gridster  which is already implemented   but it's gets difficult when mixing directives  connecting to controllers  scopes  rootscopes  even for 2 directives  but what about full complex module with 2 10 nested directives with many many functionality  so i wonder if anyone thinking of creating  if it's even possible  some wrapper to simplify directive object  like  haml  sass etc   dont swear me
i attached an event listener to the   select   directly to  console log this value   and it never logged for the missing one  so it would appear you are correct  caitp  it seems it could be a browser bug after all  although  i can't seem to recreate it without angular   
i tried with ng required also but didn't work for me 
 matsko sorry for the delay  it was a loading spinner in my case   generated from http   spiffygif com  format png color 000  the spinner should show when the upload of the image is done and the processing of the image starts for which i cannot provide progress information 
would be glad to make a pr for this on the nearest weekends
i filed it as a bug as i didn't realize  success  and  error  were   http  specific  even though it's by design  that still seems like confusing api design 
the correct value is so important for us  because we use selenium + watir for our integration tests and reading and setting the value of a   select   element only works if the value is the actual value  not an array index  our current workaround is to write the model value back into a data attribute  e g     select ng model "foo" data current value "  foo  " ng options "   "    but that is rather hacky in my eyes and also you can't use the helpers for select inputs given by watir  so we are trying to get rid of it 
 narretz i'm not sure where your confusion is coming from    the  vm  is defined in the  controlleras  property  i don't see that being confusing at all   
it is so strange  it works in all browsers expect for safari  i am creating a directive  and in directive i create a new instanceof draggablelist2 
i can try and put something together  interestingly i can't find requestanimationframe method in the code  i'm using angular v1 2 16 and seperate angular animate

 caitp don't you think we should have another interceptor   noresponse serverfailure  for this case  i insist  but just this time  because there is no reponse from the server 
we have updated angular version to 1 2 26 and still able to replicate this issue  below is the snapshot of heap allocation    heapsnap001  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 529483 4537743 95f45154 4de2 11e4 98e3 5eba46f6c36e png 
 narretz yes they're all 1 3  doublechecked it myself as well    
suppose we have a watch w1 on value v1  also  another watch w2 may also change the value of v1  is there a way to prevent w1 from being fired if v1 is changed by w2 
just to keep the example short     in a recent case i stumbled across i have two  select s inside the  ng form   handling the display of validation errors in this   ng if "   "   style you usually see in examples is surely going to end up in a maintenance hell  to prevent that we attach validation errors from the server side to the angular controls  another directive then inspects the form controllers   valid  state and handles display   highlighting of invalid form fields   errors

 gkalpak my use case is similar to this one from an  angular injector documentation  https   docs angularjs org api ng function angular injector   so i have an angular app which is using separate framework for drawing in one of used directives  configured externally from json file  so i can't inject injector  in some elements i wish to use data from other angular services  so i need instance of already initialised angular app  and it's working fine  except under ngmock tests 
that's what i mentioned in the first comment  since removing cloned element by clearing  innerhtml  works right too  i think there's something wrong during the destruction of the jqlite object that will affect original element 
sorry probably i haven't been very clear  given my  httpbacked expectget   failed because i was calling the wrong url  i'd like to be able to do something along these lines   and see a list of api calls received by the mocked http backend  that way i could see that i was calling the wrong url  at the moment i don't see a way to inspect the api calls i'm actually making during my unit tests  from the failure message  i only know that for sure i didn't call the url i was expecting to call  but then i'm in the dark  i don't know if i haven't call the api at all  or if i called it with the wrong url  or wrong data  or headers  
i have no idea what is actually causing it so i can't specify what code needs to go into a plunker  seeing how other people haven't had this problem i am guessing it is an environment problem  but that is just a guess  if i try to use the same form in plunker everything works fine  this is why it is so weird    because angular is appearing to throw exceptions on lines of code that have nothing to do with the given error 
 pkozlowski opensource i'm sorry  when rename a variable i broke local jquery  so the selectbox stopped working  now i replaced jquery  works  thank you 
actually you fixed that bug with this version  http   jsfiddle net 8j5er1yp  but introduced new one  after steps of the previous bug just move thirditem to "in progress" again and seconditem will contain all three hosts  but should contain only two  it happens in ie9 only 
sorry  my bad  i meant something like   catch  in thenables  but only for the sake of the  notify  operation  example 
i guess that a change not much beginner people would notice while using tutorials older versions with newer ng js file  anyway  the issue is closed 
the error occurs when i use ng html binding like ng html binding "somehtml" within an html element  "somehtml" is a vaiable within my scope  the code says "use the push method of an array if it´s not an array"
thanks  narretz   i should've done that    here is the plnkr for it  http   plnkr co tnuk4dukij7re61uvovh

i'll do my best to put together a minimized sample over the weekend and post a link here  thanks for the quick response 
the framework should check with if statement or similar instead of relying on try  catch program flow   the try   catch way its implemented right now makes visual studio debugger stop execution  every time i refresh the page  
 gkalpak yep  i'm using  nganimate  module in couple of places   nganimate  used only in cases    animate addclass container  'my class'      animate enter clone   element parent     element      animate enabled bool     bool is true or false  that's it for   animate  service  css animations also here  i use transitions for  ng hide add    ng hide remove  and some other classes  but not especially for  div  with  ng view  attribute

when i first noticed the problem  by clicking on a link whose routing was set to a  code templateurl ''  code   the entire browser  not just the tab  became unresponsive for about 10 seconds and my cpu usage rose to 100   then a firefox alert told me that a script on the page was taking too long and gave me the option to let the script run  or to stop the script  i chose to let it run and eventually the browser crashed  meaning it force closed and the mozilla crash reporter opened  in subsequent tests  i can replicate the unresponsiveness and high cpu usage every time  but i no longer get the option to stop the script  the browser just crashes and the crash reporter opens  this only happens when templateurl is an empty string  i chose to report it here because i suspected either an infinite loop in angularjs or perhaps a lack of input validation for the function that uses the templateurl setting to setup the route 
for first issue ng message cannot show   this plunker can show  http   plnkr co edit lml0dryxj6xkt9fasgsn   for this sample just clear any value of input that will show validation message but if i change 1 3 16 to 1 4 1  the message cannot show 
changes made in transformrequest are changing the scope in my view  because of an  digest cycle  and this is bad  which transformdata

yeah  i am using an ime to enter chinese characters  the problem is like this  i want to enter "你好" and i just press these keys “nihao” which are the keys on the keyboard that represent "你好" in chinese pinyin input method  before i press the enter key to choose the chinese characters "你好"  the english characters "ni'hao" are already read  i mean that before i finish the input process  the callback of angular in the watch is called  so  the output of console is first "ni'hao"  and then "你好"  the callback function was called twice times  while just the second one is what i hoped  this problem is not appeared on firefox browser while it is on google chrome browser  i found some relate things on the internet and wish you to handle the problem  thanks   composition event on mozilla  https   developer mozilla org en us docs web events compositionstart   composition event blog of somebody  http   blog evanyou me 2014 01 03 composition event index html 
the group in charge of usability here believes that user's find grayed out information confusing  they believe that users ultimately spend time trying to figure out why the field is grayed out  and how to make the data accessible  even if they don't need to   instead of moving on in the form  therefore  we're currently using one time binding to decide whether or not to show a span or the input based on the validity of the data being retrieved 
i am not completely sure when this issue started to occur but i am pretty sure it was not present in ios 8  i can reproduce it on ios 9 1 and 9 2 it is also visible with angular 1 2 29

 narretz thanks for checking  i'm not using a timeout to call  and would expect directly hitting the url to result the same if that were the case  it's the act of linking to it that seems to reproduce the error  net error wise  here's an example from failed  resource   it shows as cancelled on chrome and firefox  and with further digging on chrome   net internals #events you find the the request is aborted due to error  3 or  101  both errors don't have a great deal of info on them   note  i replaced the domain with "domain" in the log as it's open api at the moment 
sure thing  will put something together over the next few days

yes  i understand your point  if  browser url   is only called with current url  it is certainly fine  however   browser url url  replace  state  as a public service  and parameter url is custom specified  don't you think it's confused to developer  many big enterprises have different sub domain sites  their domain switch is frequent  so  they may well use  browser url   to change current url  and in modern browsers which support history pushsate    it will fail  on wed  apr 13  2016 at 4 19 pm  georgios kalpakas  notifications github com
 narretz i don't use directive in the table  is it need  
we are trying to optimize the uses of the  watchers in one application where the number are quite extensive  we were switching to use scope  watch with objectequality    true which relies on angular copy and angular equals  while doing so we found 3 scenarios in our application where objects with circular references were seem    one is under the code we produce  but we haven't figure out how to remove it without loosing functionality    the other two are caused by a third party library based on bootstrap internally handle by our client  we basically don't have an option of fixing these cases  the optimization we have implemented works fine as long as the angular equals doesn't find an object with a circular reference  but that is not the case  actually it is quite the opposite  circular references are find a lot  and we don't have too much options to actually fix the ones that are identified so far 
assume  you register an http interceptor that will handle both "requesterror" and "responseerror" by returning an new promise that is rejected  in your code you call any method on the  http service  assume  http post         the server will return an badrequest on that method  what i want  i want to observe in my interceptor if any method has registered an catch on the new promise  if so i should do nothing as the http error is resolved by any other code  if not i want to process the message an show it in an general way   within an bootstrap alert on the upper side of the page   to the user and also log it localy  i want to build an general error handling that will handle all messages that are not contains the status 200
i had simplified the plunker further and it does not require iframes  so the description we have should apply and should be reproducible but    i have tested now on the latest beta version 52 0 2743 60 beta m  64 bit  and it is not reproducible  but it is again  sometimes  when opening an incognito window  sorry  for the editing and the confusion     it is reproducible in version 54 0 2787 0 canary  64 bit  so you can close it  and we'll reopen if it's still reproducible once 54 reachs beta  i have opened the following on chromium  https   bugs chromium org p chromium issues detail id 625656

 gkalpak  petebacondarwin i don't know what was exactly going wrong  i don't have enough debugging experience on angular  but it was solved when i ran  bower install angular material datetimepicker   i saw a few issues on this in the past  hope this helps whoever comes across this error 
issue does seem to be resolved in 1 6 8 build 5518 though my own testing has been limited 
no  i reset the workspace to step 8 by running  git checkout  f step 8   i am using linux to be specifc glinux  
i guess the user has control over  request originalurl   so the user can inject script in   base href "  base "   and then the code could be injected into   send directorylisting

i don't think so because multiple construction yards already allow you to build faster  i have to check this   but a ranked mcv moves faster   and this is important to save it from a massive attack  to deploy it in front of an enemy base or to move it curtained through massive defenses  what could you do with a starred mcv   it's really hard to have but it's ultra fast and it auto regenerates its health  not when deployed   
oh sorry i wanted to say support powers  nuclear missiles  iron curtains  paratroopers     
maps seem to work correctly with this pr 
 nelax the walled mcv is an ai and is there only to have another ai on the map  i could have put a power plant instead  or anything else

ooohh sorry  i didn't noticed that   
basically the vehicle keeps an active command bar with functional hotkey   cursor behavior  it provides voice feedback when you give it orders  but it doesn't follow the orders since you're no longer the owner 
figured it out  right click on your minimap after building a radar dome 
cancel all his constructions  so he needs to start building it again    take out his gps for 1 min  steal his gps at that time  not forever  reset gps construction
someone else test this  play against ai on 0902 dedicated  and you might have crash before 10 min  
solution  removing custombuildtimevalue  fixed the problem  and building the proc didn't cause a crash anymore  i made a pull request  removing the offending code  https   github com openra openra pull 2698 mailaender  yes  it would be good to fix it  i started using custombuildtimevalue  for the classic c c mod  because it's necessary in order to emulate proc  hpad and a couple other things

i like the idea  but probably not to feasible  i can imagine the interface for such a thing would be pretty clunky 
i wouldn't know how to properly prototype them  do you mean how much space transports should have and how much each vehicle should take up 
simple fix then  right

i did some games vs bots with debug mode  the movement behavior reported here is as  pchote explained  so this has been around for a very long time  to reproduce this get a large amount of infantry and move them around on the map with right clicking only  they will trail behind  with attack move you don't see this happening  they will all move to that cell and try to fill all cells closest to that destination  with the movement they will fill the cells at the destination and then the rest of the infantry will stop  so this is correct behavior and this is my error for not realizing this sooner  sorry  _   netnazgul this is correct  i also noticed this doing the same close looks  infantry on defense stance will have attack red lines pop up trying to attack the units  so see this happen have your units on a number key  let them get hit by long range units  ie  rocket infantry   with the army selected hold down the alt key and you will see them trying to attack even out of range

alternatives are discussed here https   github com openra openra pull 13547 trait types having an unique sequential index  which would require mods to register traits to get a unique index and after use this index in a variable to retrieve a specific trait container  this to by pass generic type lookup time and the need for a hash map  not a pretty solution that would break a lot of code   the solution in this issue is cleaner  you could still have a 2nd non static traitdictionary on the side  in which you load the world which then after you have to copy to the static version  you could combine both

does for me  reproduce the crash   oops  sorry  no it isn't  the commit specified in the packaging files is 0g4hlwi59ifsn70z0p69r5dhk99vh9pacpf9zcvv3rgmbw848lvx  which is invalid  so given the issues i've had with the package it is probably from the playtest  as i'm not sure i'm going to close until if and when it happens again from 297be6d

alright  i'll try clean and rebuild
item  i can try that right now  and i'll get back to you on it abcdefg30  you're welcome  but i checked for some updates to no avail  however  i uninstalled all traces of the game  reinstalled  and it works fine now  don't understand what went wrong tbh 
according to powershell's own version command  i am running 2 0  as shipped with windows 7 service pack 1  it seems the only way to upgrade past this is to install windows management framework  which i don't believe windows update does  of note is that this only goes up to 5 1  and to go to 6 and beyond  one must install powershell core   this may need to be listed as a user installed requirement  i will test to see if it fixes the problem and post my findings 
why would it conflict  it's first calculated for the primary and if all ports are blocked it will check for others
hey thanks for the help  pretty old device  mobile intel r  4 series express chipset family  microsoft corporation   wddm 1 1    version 8 15 10 2702
i can provide other logs if needed  i downloaded the freeware iso files and imported the resources from them  i was playing on easy if it matters   replay is here   https   youtu be 7mao4osydve 
i downloaded the "playtest" versions  and they work just fine  it was strange  because openra worked fine on my system a few months ago  but it seems it got broken after an ubuntu 16 04 security update  the new playtest versions seem to work great  thanks 
hi mitchell  i'm not sure about it as well  the problem is that i can't reproduce it in other circumstances  i tried irb as well as just a ruby script  but that just worked  i also looked at this thread http   www ruby forum com topic 101243   but repeating those steps didn't give me the issue either  so i guess there is something in the vagrant code that makes it different  but i don't know what  and of course  there must be something significantly different with my setup  because it apparently works for you and others  currently  i'm working around this by just doing "ssh  p 2222 vagrant localhost"  this works for my because i've added my host  ssh directory as shared folder and symlinked my public key as authorized_keys
sorry i'll explain a bit more  i have been used to and have been observing the following behaviour up until 3 3  vagrant up    "starts vm if not started yet  and provisions when box didn't exists before" vagrant reload    "restarts vm  and always provisions box" i know that chef will just exist after it has done all checks  but those checks can take long enough to annoy when unnecessary  in my case that's for rails_test_box   and sometimes you just want to start the box and don't care about the provisioning  so what i would like to see is a command that just starts the box without provisioning 
i don't think that is related  they appear as links within the guest vm  it's just that the path is       folder_on_host which doesn't go anywhere within the guest  the only odd part for me is that this worked in the old lucid32 box 
thanks  briancain how embarrassing  i ran vagrant version saw 2 0 0 but didn't read all the other stuff telling me to update to that version  sigh  rtfm indeed  updated to 2 0 0  updated my plugins  had success bringing up both boxes  added in private networking to my vagrantfile and it's looking good  thanks so much  issue was user   
hi  mitchellh  however all of the files and directories in that command exists  o 
i wasn't able to reproduce this either  my current feeling is "network hiccup" 
my brother conferred with you on this  josh   it was the ip being 33 33 33 1  changed to 33 33 33 10 and it boots just fine 
hmm  this is becoming more weird  i couldn't get the vagrant up and running with the option you gave me  is it something with ssh  if yes  i don't have a problem in connecting to guest machine with ssh but bringing up the environment   not sure though correct me if i am wrong  
i can confirm it is still not fixed in 0 8 5  i have also noticed the following odd behavior  if i take my image that works with nfs in 0 7 6   virtualbox 4 0 12 and upgrade vagrant  then do a vagrant up everything works  i am given a false sense that everything is fantastic  however  when i vagrant destroy   vagrant up  the nfs error presents itself  so it seems that the error does not present itself right away on previously working images  this bug is easy to reproduce and is currently holding us back quite a bit on the latest updates  i am prepared to help out in any way possible to debug and fix this  just let me know what other information i can provide to help solve it 
yes of course  it contains 
ok  i ran this from within the vm two ways  this is as user "vagrant"  
1  create a new directory 2  add the 'base' box with "vagrant box add base url" 3  create the default vagrantfile with "vagrant init" 4  rename vagrantfile to non_standard_name 5  execute the ruby 1 9 script below
the problem is that the path   project vagrant    doesn't exist  when i look in the   project directory it is empty  start sh is related to stuff being run for the addons mozilla org development site zamboni  http   mozilla github com zamboni    it seems that the   project vagrant is correctly mapping the first time vagrant starts  however  that mapping gets lost on restart  here are the win7 install instructions that i've been developing for zamboni  ++++ begin setup instructions ++++  windows instructions for installing vagrant and zamboni on microsoft windows  step 1  download and install oracle's virtualbox if you haven't already  http   www virtualbox org  step 2  download and install mysysgit from  http   code google com p msysgit downloads list this is needed so that windows has git capablity  in git setup you need to choose the following options    on "adjusting your path environment" dialog choose "run git from the windows command prompt"    on "choosing the ssh executable" dialog choose "use openssh"    on "configuring the line ending conversions" dialog choose "checkout as is  commit unix style line ending"  extremely important  zamboni will fail if this isn't set correctly   step 3  download and install rubyinstaller from  http   rubyinstaller org downloads  make sure to select option to add ruby path executable paths  step 4  download and extract development kit from above url  probably easiest to extract to c  devkit then follow developer kit installation instructions at  https   github com oneclick rubyinstaller wiki development kit summary of instructions    using command prompt cd folder development kit was extracted into  e g  cd c  devkit    run the command "ruby dk rb init"  without quotes   then run the command "ruby dk rb install"  again without quotes  to install rubygems    confirm installation by running the following commands    gem install rdiscount   platform ruby   ruby  rubygems  e "require 'rdiscount'  puts rdiscount new '  hello rubyinstaller  '  to_html" command prompt should echo out " p  strong helo rubyinstaller   strong   p " step 5  run the command "gem install vagrant"  without quotes  note  if you are running 64bit windows you must use v0 9 6 or above otherwise virtual box will not be detected properly  step 6  cd to the folder above where you want the zamboni folder and files to be placed  e g  c   run the command "git clone   recursive git   github com mozilla zamboni git" this will take some time  go get a cup of coffee  eat lunch  go for a walk  etc  step 7  in the zamboni folder  e g  c  zamboni  find the file "vagrantfile" and open it in your favorite text editor  look for the following lines   step 8  it is time to build your zamboni virtual machine  in the command prompt  cd to the zamboni folder  e g  cd c  zamboni  and run the command "vagrant up"  again without quotes   this step will download the zamboni virtual machine from mozilla and install it  before warned that this archive is many hundred megabytes in size so it will take some time to download even if you are on a broadband connection  step 9  download putty ssh client and puttygen from http   www chiark greenend org uk  sgtatham putty download html  these are standalone executable files  you need to save them in their permanent location   e g  c  program files  x86  putty   step 10  you need to generate a private key for putty  to do this  launch puttygen and click on the "generate" button  you will be instructed to randomly move your mouse around the puttygen window to generate the key  once this is done  click on "load" and find the file "insecure_private_key"  it will probably be in your user folder under " vagrant d"  e g  on win7 at "c  users your username  vagrant d"   now save your public key and then save your private key  use different file names for each   step 11  create a putty ssh session for zamboni  launch putty  in the host name put "127 0 0 1" and in the port use "2222"  in the category pane find "data" under "connection" and place "vagrant" in the auto login username field  then expand out the "ssh" branch and select "auth"  next to the "private key file for authentication" field click on browse and find the private key you just generated  select it and click "open" in the folder browser window  now go back to "session" in the category pane in putty  add "vagrant" to the saved sessions field and then click "save"  this will save your session for future use  step 12  login to zamboni by clicking on "open" in the putty window  this should automatically log you into the zamboni vm  if you add the putty file path to your system properties environment variable "path"  e g  " c  program files  x86  putty"  you should be able to reference putty from the command prompt by simply calling "putty  load vagrant" once you restart your command prompt  the first time you log into zamboni you should see a very long series of scrolling text with lots of sql statements etc  this is the database migrations taking place  this phase could take quite a while to complete  don't do anything to your putty vm session until it gives you a message about being able to exit using control+c  congratulations if things went well your zamboni vm is up and running  you should now be able to access your development server on a special ip address set up by vagrant  point your web browser to http   33 33 33 24 8000 
still trying to build a vagrant windows installer with the 1 1 0  master  branch  not as simple as building vagrant  the workaround for now is to add all script lines to a file in the mounted shared file system  and use the directive  config vm provision  shell   path    " name of script file " in the vagrantfile  a simple example of the script contents would be  #  bin bash apt get  y update line separators must be  nix compatible  if the ctrl m  carriage return  is present  bash will flag it as an invalid character  and the script will fail  if you are going to create the script file from windows  use something like notepad++  not notepad  either that or "apt get  y install dos2unix" to install the  nix package in an instantiated vm  use this command to strip invalid characters from the script file on the shared file system  for example    dos2unix  vagrant myscriptfile sh or   sudo dos2unix  vagrant myscriptfile sh
a default configuration file only contains  as far as a dozen vagrant up can testify  this is  overidding   disabling   not calling   ignoring       nuking   the  home rgarrigu  vagrant d boxes xos include _vagrantfile which content i pasted in my initial post

while http   downloads vagrantup com is useful it isn't something i watch on a regular basis  plus the fact that releases are broadcasted on a public channel like twitter  many repos like epel  puppet  jenkins  etc    have release packages which add a yum apt repo s  to the system so an admin can just run update    upgrade  with this feature i could then simply do a puppet package resource type rather than wget for a hardcoded version or script some curl and parse the response to get the latest version   examples    http   fedora mirror nexicom net epel 6 i386 repoview epel release html   http   docs puppetlabs com guides puppetlabs_package_repositories html   http   www ovirt org yum_repo_file

hi mitchell  i guess a lot of top level features can be done with shell provisioning  i found that when using just public_network e g  config vm network  public_network this effectively just adds another default route  so the one to the host remains  you would expect that by configuring network in this manner  the guest would act like any other dhcp client on the lan  the guest can for example continue to reach out to the internet  but packets forward through the nat route wouldn't make it back to the remote host  on fri  oct 18  2013 at 12 02 pm  mitchell hashimoto   notifications github com  wrote

yes  this does reproduce with just a bare vagrantfile  i'm relatively new to vms  but i've been working it for a couple days now with no luck  do you have any suggestions for directions i can try  i have the time to look into it i'm just at a dead end now

there is a race condition in vagrant librarian chef when running with multiple aws vms  when librarian chef runs  it deletes the directory it's managing and re downloads all the cookbooks  the race condition is because librarian chef is invoked on a per vm basis  so  it deletes and re downloads for vm1  vm2  and vm3 separately  this isn't a problem with virtualbox because vb runs its provisioners in serial  however  aws runs its provisioners in _parallel_  so we end up with some vms "missing" files because another vm's provisioning step deleted them  what vagrant librarian chef  and all the cookbook management plugins  cause vagrant berkshelf has a similar issue  needs to do is manage the cookbook directories on a _global_ basis  not when each vm is provisioned  in other words  the action sequence should change from this    vagrant provision   for each vm    vagrant librarian chef installs the cookbooks for the cheffile thisvm uses   do whatever sync'ing is needed  shared folders  rsync for vagrant aws  etc    chef solo executes to this    vagrant provision   globally  vagrant librarian chef iterates over all cheffiles   install cookbooks for each cheffile   do whatever sync'ing is needed  shared folders  rsync for vagrant aws  etc    for each vm   chef solo executes
ok drpebcak  if you have any contact with virtualbox to send a bug  the world will appreciate that 
i'm not sure  i still cannot get it working 
is there a flag i need for that  i downgraded to 1 5 0 in order to continue working but i can upgrade in a bit to see if we can resolve this 
 mitchellh we were receiving the same error that  alimony mentioned above  using virtualbox as the provider 
i was using  hashicorp precise64  i have to note i haven't tried other boxes except for a puphpet install with the exact same os on it  both boxes gave me this problem 
mitchell  one of our chef cookbooks was modifying the vagrant user and therefore vagrant wasn't able to ssh in  therefore making the vm useless  i've changed our cookbooks and resolved the issue  sorry for the false alarm 
here it is   https   github com kevinmeredith win7ie9box blob master win7ie9 box  thank you for taking a look   mitchellh 
sure  here's something that should show the issue  for the mysqldump part i guess you'll have to have access to some database somewhere you can dump from     let me know if you also need me to provide some sort of dummy data set  i'm running vagrant 1 5 3 by the way 
i can not do something simple like this    vagrant init http   opscode vm bento s3 amazonaws com vagrant vmware opscode_ubuntu 10 04_chef provisionerless box a  vagrantfile  has been placed in this directory  you are now ready to  vagrant up  your first virtual environment  please read the comments in the vagrantfile as well as documentation on  vagrantup com  for more information on using vagrant  that looks good   however  when i run vagrant up  this is what i get    vagrant up bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider        default  box 'http   opscode vm bento s3 amazonaws com vagrant vmware opscode_ubuntu 10 04_chef provisionerless box' could not be found  attempting to find and install    default  box provider  virtualbox default  box version     0     default  adding box 'http   opscode vm bento s3 amazonaws com vagrant vmware opscode_ubuntu 10 04_chef provisionerless box'  v0  for provider  virtualbox default  downloading  http   opscode vm bento s3 amazonaws com vagrant vmware opscode_ubuntu 10 04_chef provisionerless box an error occurred while downloading the remote file  the error message  if any  is reproduced below  please fix this error and try again 
i have been unable to reproduce  and the original box with the problem is no longer exhibiting the problem  i did muck with the settings a bit  but i have nothing useful to add  the only thing to note is the box was using nfs  then i adjusted to using rsync  but i have switched back and forth  and again unable to reproduce  i'll reopen with more info if crops up again 
 marnovdm this is working but for some reason adding a box already on my computer isn't  mitchellh i tried with another box and here's the debug log 
yep  even using the same min vagrantfile works normal  one directory  then upgrade vagrant and us same one  after destroying first test   then uninstall vagrant and install 1 3 5     and it works normal again  i tried on another computer as well 
my guess is that you already had  var www   which made "mkdir  var www html" work  i only have  var   since  var www is only added when the httpd package is installed  "mkdir  var www html" therefor doesn't work  "mkdir  p" before the rsync command would have done the trick 
i'm afraid not  even when i export the  atlas_token  and attempt to do a  vagrant login   i am not able to authenticate and it tells me to export the  atlas_token  env var due to the 2 factor authentication i have enabled on the account 
omg  that was browser lag sorry lol
the log was too big that i had to create https   github com crocket vagrant up log for the debug log  it's weird that if i have only 'apt get install  y bridge utils' in the provisioning shell script  bridge utils is installed correctly  the issue occurs only if salt tries to install bridge utils in some conditions 
it seems i already deleted this file  but i remember that my vagrantfile was using custom docker host machine and was very simple  i will check my windows machine backups for an example 
 mitchellh  here is the    debug  output  https   gist github com sanyax7 04598cc3b9c73afe1688 if i understood correctly  this issue is related to the problem i reported earlier in the https   github com mitchellh vagrant issues 5067 
perhaps i should be filing a different bug report  then  because on edit  ubuntu 12 04 4 lts following the documentation does not work
sho nuff  sorry  this apparently got buried in my inbox  i'll get that as soon as i can  +1 
 petardudas the vm never worked  or rather  vagrant never succeeded in detecting it's version  as a consequence  there is no vm to start because it was never created    i can however confirm that virtualbox works as it should  because it works fine for other tools i'm using   sailfishos sdk uses two virtualboxes  one for compiling and one as an emulator  
like a charm  thanks 
hi  sethvargo  thank you for the response   i was upgrading vagrant from 1 6 3 to 1 7 2 both downloaded from vagrantup com   the target machine is an osx yosemite though version 1 6 3 was installed before upgrading   vmware software  workstation  fusion  has never been present on the machine hope it can help  i can provide further details if needed
 sethvargo do you really think documentation on the subject is enough  personally i started looking for the documentation _after_ it happened  not before      seems a bit odd to me that commands such as 'vagrant status' and 'vagrant ssh' can cause a complete purge  regardless of whichever user invokes them 
hi seth  this is actually pre vagrantfile when trying to add a box that was created via packer  the issue is when doing the  vagrant box add trusty64 path to my box  that vagrant is assuming some os specific paths  not using an agnostic pathing library to resolve  i was able to successfully add the box if i changed directory into the downloads folder before running the add  so it didn't have to navigate any non native paths  i have a feeling the   which is used in cygwin but not windows threw it off

hi  sethvargo  thank you for the explanation    it makes sense why the overrides are processed last now  your workaround works  but becomes awkward when some provisions are supposed to run with all providers  for example   i don't actually use inline scripts in practice  all my scripts are in files  i can't consolidate them  though  because i have different vagrantfiles that combine the scripts in different ways   some vagrantfiles might include a  b  c  d  some might only include a  c  d  etc   so working around this will make my vagrantfiles huge and difficult to maintain  would be possible to add some other method of ordering to the provisioners  such as priority levels or dependencies 
thank you  you are correct  fireamp quarantined both the vagrant executable for 1 7 3 and 1 7 4  i will find a way to override that    capture  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 13630215 9181680 e0d1f976 3f6b 11e5 996b a0473dc28462 png

yes  that makes sense  but puppet is never executed  vagrant instead executes the last powershell script again  the script "runboxstartergist ps1" is executed two time while puppet never runs 
do you want the debug output  thanks 
no  without the plugin installation i get no error  the error comes from the "exec" command 
yes virtualization is enabled and i can create a virtual machine via the virtualbox gui 
i tried to ssh in and couldn't which meant that my box wasn't being provisioned properly  it looks like it was having problems interacting with the provider  it couldn't interact with the provider because hyper v was enabled  disabling hyper v fixed or switching providers fixed the problem

 schlueter hi  thanks for you response  i'm using virtualbox 5 1 26  in fact everything is working great when i connect in ssh via putty so it seems to be a bug of vagrant ssh i guess    i can't reproduce the bug with previous version of vim like 7 4  i'm going to try another box but i think it's not related to the box since it's working with putty 
yes i have  i installed docker so it needs the hyper v  then i uninstalled docker e tried to unisnstall hyper v  however  while the system is uninstalling the hyper v occur an error and the system is restored and hyper v comes back  i don't know what to do 
hi  briancain  thanks for your reply  i just tried ubuntu xenial64 a few times and i am not getting the issue with that  so there is a problem with ubuntu trusty64  unfortunately  it is ubuntu trusty64 that i need to use at the moment 
hello  i solved this problem globally  i installed ubuntu and now everything works fine  i don't know why  after last update in windows nothing worked fine  so in my case i solved the problem reinstalling os   d
 gildegoma that solution would work quite well  i can't volunteer to work on it right now  but perhaps in the future if it isn't picked up  thanks 
the process starts automatically at windows startup and runs all the time  the process does not crash and restart  stopping and restarting the process does not change the error messages 
manually i could able to create shared folder via vmware workstation gui  but when i vagrant up it is not created  but it works fine with windows guest 
hi brian  the debug log does not show the json error unfortunately  and i am not able to provide a vagrant file as it contains sensitive information  do you really need to see the vagrantfile 
the folder was created via a  git clone  on the host machines side  i used git clone in the  c  vagrant my project  directory on the host machine  could working in the c   directory be causing permissions issues  it looks like i don't have access to  c  vagrant  on the guest machine either  same issue with permission denied when performing  ls   here's the console output when i perform  vagrant powershell   not sure if it's helpful at all   hopefully i answered all your questions  thanks for taking the time to respond 
hi  briancain thanks for replying so fast    that's the first image i'm building with packer and deploying with vagrant  therefore i did not try others  you're right  i actually changed the privileged to _true_ and it worked like a charm  although i had to add a sleep in the first provision script to give some time for the smb to become available  otherwise i get "network path not accesssible"  i think the fact i couldn't access this smb folder via manual winrm connection via  enter pssession  drove me nuts  btw    i'm still getting this access denied error  but now i don't care much once i'm able to access via regular means  via provision scripts   thanks a lot for the help  issue closed 
hey  briancain thanks  yeah  i get the same error with or without  sudo   here's the debug log for  vagrant up   debug  without  sudo   https   gist github com noi5e c2245c8187ef12bfb1affb735a167430
yes  seems to work 
yes it worked before  a couple of weeks earlier 
imo it should be error  the exported symbol rename   that's a good idea  one may have a module just to re export some messy api in clean way 
indeed  it looks like what i asked for  could the manual give an example how to return values from templates  my attempts to return an int failed 
 araq  could you show a small example how the symbol for variable is not needed  i tried this and that to no avail 
69e2dfbc6690cf1d9c65c0b25fe44b4649aed0af fixed this 
araq  thanks for the speedy response  wouldn't you rather keep this issue open as a reminder for an input that makes the compiler segfault  regardless of whether or not this input is  currently  valid nimrod code 
yes  that is in my example above 
i've just tried with nimrod_9276a6db2bf2 zip  the latest build  i suppose   binaries compiled with visual c++ 2013  x86  crash the same way   
 dom96 ok  closing  non deprecated method works 
well  for me that message was confusing  i had to take back all the code modifications i had done in the last 10 minutes before  the point i compiled for the last time successfully  to get an idea about the problem  of course the error location was reported correctly  but "find" symbol was not mentioned in error text  and i was sure strutils was already imported    what was wrong  the "template generic instantiation" message really confused me  i had the feeling i really did something evel  but ok  when there is no easy way to improve error message for this case  than we can close this issue  next time i will know  maybe 
thanks for your reply  making only p untyped already solves the problem   i think we may close this bug report 
for this particular use case the answer is most probably yes  i guess i'm just concerned about having nim'isms where things work in some cases  but not in others  i stumbled upon it  others will  too  any errors that are not obvious will be sand in the gears of new adopters 
tried with the latest "devel" branch of csources  reported the error to nim lang csources then was told that i should raise the issue here  if there is anything else i can try  let me know 
i did not  i assumed that string h was missing from my mac because i built only gcc cross compiler and not g++  i have not built g++ on mac yet  been running into some build issues 
the issue is that i'm running nim c from c  nim workspace hello_world  sure  i could specify the whole path  but it seems like the ideal behavior would be to just have it always wrap in quotes 
i use asyncdispatch  not sure what that does internally   but no explicit threads and no casts at all 
yeah  it was added in api level 21  android 5 0+   but most applications today target api level 16  android 4 1+   so that majority of android users are supported  about 40  of android devices today are 4 x  https   developer android com about dashboards index html as you can see  there is no  signalfd h  in  jb release  branch  https   github com android platform_bionic tree jb release libc include sys
yes it does  i missed proc     i  tnimrodident   string   magic  "identtostr"  nosideeffect   converts a nimrod identifier to a string source tried string cstring  and cstring string but both of those did not work  thanks 
1  users browsing "github nim lang " may wonder "where is the nim repository itself  this way it will be in place  2  it looks less like somebody's little private project and more like a big thing  3  it is done this way in other projects 
thanks yes  the code in below   why the compiler complain ''error  selector must be of an ordinal type  float or string" 
sorry about that  i suppose it goes deeper than that and compiler goes only that deep with warrnings   net nim   isipaddress    https   github com araq nim blob master lib pure net nim#l1264 
hey   josephwecker  that sounds fucking awesome  and well thought out regarding the semantic meaning of the runes  i've just begun fiddling with the source  so need some time getting aquainted  and could put my time on fixing something else on the nim issue list instead  no point duplicating an effort  i would _really_ appreciate that getting into the 'piler   dom96   as mentioned  swiftly done in vim  and other editors  personally  i have made my own keymap  since most programming chars are not easily accessible in the swedish layout  i'll just add 'the chosen one' to my hacker se layout  granted  that might not be the most common thing generally to do  most editors allows abbreviations though  and many allow direct unicode typing with ' uxxxx'+space  in linux you can type "ctrl+shift+u" then the unicode point number  than space  so in linux case there's not even need for editor support  slightly cumbersome to type though   i assume the same hold for windows  mac etc   but do not know them 
it reports
dunno  but are there not tests in place for asyncfile 
 araq nim was compiled from git devel   nim   version  output  freebsd clang
this is a hover spoiler  smile 
we can use conversion  but this is not the only issue with vs2010  the problem is should nim generate c89 compatible code to support vs2010 or generate c99 code and leave vs2010 behind 
either one is good  just need a quick a question answer channel     it will bring more contributors as they can ask help from core dev while blocked by some compiler code question 
thanks  i will wait that changes  is it possible to make bindings in nim to nodejs libs  it has async wrapers  timers  async server with best security and performance  it is best optimized can you give some links to instructions how to make bindings in nim to c and c++ libs  how to make nim compile c and c++ sources with nim code  thanks
here is a changed example that works in 0 12 0  but fails in 0 13 0  it is a simplified version of my code that writes macros inside macros for calling  bindsym  and  declaredinscope  
well i got a compilation error upon doing  var d   2  with a space before the  var 
that's strange  i updated using  choosenim  today  but got this 
no  the json is a payload from a websocket connection 
hi  dominik  we are writing little database server based on sophia engine  as i think   problem in this place  https   github com recoilme pudge blob master pudge nim#l971 frontend writed in perl and use cache memcached fast for connection to server  perl  plackup module  fork processes  each server fork process not more then 255 processes running at same time  and   kills process wich consume too much memory  so  we run server  and all work well around 1 hour  after that   server stop to response  if i telnet to server via terminal   server connect  but dont response on command  i added logging and atomic counter for clients and see no error or exceptions  but see what after 141 client or so   server stop accepting new clients  i think what only place where it may be it accept reconnect cycle  i dont may reproduce it stable but see similar behavior then i do some error in clients  i think better option will be have flag notsafedisconnect or trying to connect not more then 4 times with 500 ms timeout for example  sorry for my english 
no  cause many libraries works only with default callback  and they will ovewrite "composing" callback 
just reported it in case it wasn't intended
some of the commands i was trying to use resulted in the server opening a data connection to transmit the response  maybe instead of exporting those two procs  a better approach might be to alter the  send  to pass back data from the data connection if that gets triggered 
unfortunately it does not  it works with  seq  but not with custom generic types 
yup  current version is  0 12 0 
nope  same result 
very odd     i had literally just deleted my entire nim folder and cloned it again just a few hours ago  checked my path to make sure i didn't have another nim compiler in there  too  after recloning it and compiling again  everything works fine 
that the text do not make any sense  then is not really documenting anything whatsoever  looks like random documentation comments got all concatenated on the top for some reason   slightly_smiling_face 
same issue in nim 0 18 0  and you're right   cooldome  using a case statement instead of a case expression works around the issue  which will do for now but i dislike it 
msvc win10 intel
 mratsim just tried and without   newruntime it compiles fine forgot to say that the generated file where this happens is  i tried creating a small repro project  but it compiles fine even with newruntime  i can't seem to trigger that declarations ordering   
no  it's probably just for debugging  i just don't want my username etc to be included in the final binary 
 nre  and  re  do the same  both include the preceding character with the capture group match 
if nim don't allow this  it should report error  or  it should generate proper c code  isn't it 
i just think the current simple approach has its limits  for data driven code generation you might not have a 1 1 relationship at all times in terms data to emit order  in my example  i wanted to generate a higher order function  ie  a decorator  but the decorator definition might not be grouped with the function to be generated  also notice the  noemit  macro  would be useful if you could define "virtual" identifiers procs vars that can be referenced in nim  type checked  but are assumed to only be available in the backend  shadowed by nim  and therefore should not be emitted  or it would be double var declaration  
was waiting for the nightly build so i can use choosenim  works for me  thank you  cooldome
i think simply adding the following to the root makefile would be great 
the error message was a clash with the jpeg library with the ipython notebook when i simply set dyld_library_path  given there are two ways to solve it  i'm closing it for now 
i think that the main problem is that the default value of "nugget"  which is added to the diagonal elements of r  l2 penalization style  is too small for my dataset  the default value for nugget is 10_machine_epsilon  making it something like 1000_machine_epsilon is working well for me  i know i'm sounding like one of those guys who doesn't understand numerical stability and just adds  1e 6  identity to a matrix so the algorithms don't barf    investigation to come 
raise an exception   would have saved me a few hours today  most of the documentation refers to "array like" so this would be "array like but definitely not matrices"
hi alexandre  given that lars assumes linear independence among the covariates  it seems like the best option is to throw the warning and then allow the function to throw the exception as it currently does  does this seem reasonable  i'm not familiar with git but i'll see if i can work out how to make and commit the change  thanks  peter on tue  dec 20  2011 at 3 50 am  alexandre gramfort   reply reply github com
the online docs  http   scikit learn org stable auto_examples applications plot_stock_market html#stock market  contain the old version of symbol_dict  which includes the entry 'nws'  'news corp'  this causes the code  as is  to crash  the version in the github repo is correct  see issue "removing nws from list of stock prices"
hey andreas  sure  i'll do it later today
thanks for looking into it  i don't know enough about it to help much 
non regression test  you meant running tests with make and pasting output to pull request 
hi amueller  i could probably figure out a way to export the data  but this might be enough to solve it  looks like the problem is that  tree_split_best  takes 315 samples and splits it 0   46 
thanx  guys  wrapping both the loading code and the gridsearch code in if   name     "  main  " worked 
it's not really necessary to separate things into separate functions  but i was thinking that one might want to check only certain subsets of  1 2 3  and 4   for example  some functions might not care if you send in a 1d or a 2d array  but they might still require that the first dimension be the same in both inputs  another reason might be readability   code reuse  again  not really necessary  as you said  i think the main point is to check for ndim 
i put a few print lines in  type data  type query  type labels  they were all  type 'numpy ndarray'
first of all  thank you gael  jaques and andreas for such quick and positive feedback  on thu  2012 10 25 at 09 12  0700  gael varoquaux wrote  well  i looked at the error bars again  i agree with you that there is a significant difference in the cv score between best alpha and alpha   0 1  however  it would be very brave to say that the cv score of best alpha is significantly better than that of alphas in range 1e 4  1e 3   i think the lower error bar of best alpha should be above the upper error bars of alphas for which its score is significantly better  considering that this is a tutorial exercise  we should strive for clearer examples  yes  you are right  yes  i agree  i think we now have a much better exercise  thanks  i have a few suggestions for further improving the exercise  1  why are std  deviations of the scores divided by 20 when the errors lines are plot  i think they should be divided by sqrt len x   to transform them to std  errors of the means  maybe it would be even better to use 1 96 std  errors to convert them to 95  confidence intervals of the mean scores  2  in the answer to the bonus question  the difference between internal and external cross validation should be explained  as it is now  the reader may be lead to believe that performing the cv as in the exercise is effectively the same as calling lassocv in the answer to the bonus question  it is not  since lassocv performs its own internal cross validation  3  there should be a textual answer to the question  not just three different values of alpha without any further explanation  please read and improve my textual answer in the pull request  ok  will do  best regards  tadej
right after much hellish searching   i found a way to do this using inkscape  gimp   this guy's script  http   davidlynch org blog 2008 03 creating an image map from svg      it's kind of a pain to do but it works well  this avoids having to redraw anything though and allows the use of  amueller 's svg file    screenshot at 2013 03 15 02 15 39  https   f cloud github com assets 1378870 261996 3ea57f40 8d0e 11e2 858c e6d28c41bb09 png  maintaining this way is a bit of a pest  but i can try make it fairly simple with a script   so if everyone likes it i'd be happy to go ahead with it   questions though   where would this go in the docs    are there any changes anyone wants to suggest to the current  graph  http   1 bp blogspot com  me24epzpzim uqlwtwurfxi aaaaaaaaanw w3eetiroa80 s1600 drop_shadows_background png  regarding layout or more details so yeah i've got a way to do this and it will look like andy's plot with links to the documentation   i could even add a mouse over highlight to it  biggest problem was svg to image map conversion feedback please   
please see update above 
the docs say that c if not set as a float is by default none which means it is set to n_samples
sure ，numpy version is 1 6 2 ，scipy version is 0 10 1  
test_common fails to exclude abstract base classes from testing   we may fix the excluding algorithm  but this won't change the fact abcmeta is not applied in python 3 x

hmm  sorry  re running that specific example does seem to be okay  it seems reasonable sensitive to the input  the data i'm actually trying to do a pls on is quite large  so it would be hard to include my intended use case scenario  here is some code that i just ran and reproduced the error for me   i am using version 0 14 git  as stored in sklearn   version      note that n_components defaults to 2 
no  i mean i want one big dictionary that is extracted from the training set  so the total dimensionality is  n  
no  but i don't think that is required since i have libatlas3gf base and libatlas dev  i can try to change these to into openblas  but i am not sure about the risk  i have installed them a long time ago for numpy  scipy or pylab  i guess    i am not completely understand if openblas can affect these packages  thanks on 09 13 2013 10 02 am  lars buitinck wrote  ##     thanks and best regards  haohan wang master in computer science in bic lti carnegie mellon university 412 230 7535 haohanw andrew cmu edu

hi  i see  i checked the dict learning stuff and actually managed it to solve my problem after i restated it to vector form  however  it would be great so be able to solve kernelized problems like min   x  _1 s t  ax 0 and   x  _2 1 with k_ij k x_i  x_j  as a kernel  thank you a lot 
it is fixed in githib  this bug was with the version in pip 
the idea of using only predictions during training and use afterwards probas of base_estimators is strange  the base_estimator can return  0 1 and 0 9 or  0 9 and 0 1  they will have same predictions and different probas   but you don't take it into account  the 'standart' scheme as i understand is  there is score  score obj    sum  weight_i    esimator_i predict obj     assuming that predict returns 1 and  1 then this score is turned to proba by some sigmoid function  score_to_proba in sklearn's gradientboosting 
sure  i'll give it a try  what is the best way to get this file on my computer  seeing i also have a fork for the kernels in mean shift clustering  i'm new to the git utility  op 4 apr  2014 10 16 schreef "arnaud joly" notifications github com

that sounds good to me   so long as it doesn't require a pre defined set of labels  aka it would require  either  a set of pre defined labels  or the number of items per label to create our own labeling   sounds alright  on fri  aug 15  2014 at 2 13 am  alexandre gramfort   notifications github com  wrote 
i have upgraded sklearn to version 0 15 0b1  the error message is different now  see below    additional information  i am running test py with python3 
it is indeed  thanks 
thanks  you're right  it was an installation issue  there were some files from a previous pip install of sklearn that were being used incorrectly
never heard of bisect  jnothman     fast way to find a bug  thanks  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn commit 41aa3edd7866942baad071331f0c1f083b6df3ca is the offending commit from https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 12974 on my local machine  linux python 3 6 
you're right  obviously  please excuse my brain fart 
its good to have this note in the docs  i would also clarify that in the leaf node it says "values" where it shows class sample size  is it possible to show something like  samples    class a   1234  class b   456   
 amueller i didn't do anything weird  i did exactly the same as the bag of words example   http   scikit learn org stable tutorial text_analytics working_with_text_data html   only i used my own data which i extracted out of an excel file  i think the countvectorizer raised the error  as i now use a newer version of numpy  i can't reproduce the error anymore  i just thought i give you a heads up  because it took me while to find out what was the right way to install it  so that it worked for me   gaelvaroquaux i guess you are right  i only use a small amount of the sklearn library  so i don't know if i everything still works  it could very well be that i broke other things  is their a way i can test this  maybe run some tests 
i cloned scikit learn from github and then ran it  and also when i ran this on pythonanywhere site with the sklearn package they provide  same error was encountered  i also tried on my system using the sklearn that ubuntu repository gave me that too gave the same error

hi all  first thank you for taking the time to address this issue  the inspiration to pass the class and not the instance is coming from the signature of  class baseensemble baseestimator  metaestimatormixin    where it seems as if it gets the class and the parameters as variables 
hi all  just issued a pull request  re  a test  i think the following seems reasonable   is this the kind of thing you had in mind

ok  i think this is not a problem as the warning message already indicate the differences of two labelkfold method 
so  the labelbinarizer works to some extent   ps  i didn't know labelbinarizer nor multilabelbinarizer existed  a separate pr should also link the onehotencoder page to the labelbinarizer page  and maybe to the labelencoder page 
i think that's a great idea   clamus  thanks for checking the source code  at the very least though  the documentation should mention the randomization of the weights  because that's what meinshausen   bühlmann defined as their "randomized lasso   logistic regression"

i've tried to find something in the literature about calibrating regressors  but there's surprisingly little out there   i may actually write the paper up myself   the most appropriate reference is probably to the regression calibration section of chapter 6 in _handbook of research on machine learning applications and trends_  pdf  http   users dsic upv es  flip papers bfhrhandbook2010 pdf   basically  the same issue applies to regressors' predictions as classifiers' predictions  predictions can be biased generally  and even when they're not  their shape can be wrong  for example  random forest models' predictions for probabilities have a characteristic s shape  like that seen here  http   scikit learn org stable modules calibration html   where the predictions in the higher deciles are a bit too low and the predictions in the lower deciles are a bit too high   in other words  it's too cautious  the same exact thing applies to forests' predictions for regression  which tend to be similarly cautious  their rank orderings are really great  but the exact amounts tend to be closer to the mean than you'll find if you look at a hold out test set  in that scenario  using isotonic regression for calibration will make the predicted values line up better with the actual outcomes  because of its nonparametric form  the same is true for various other regression algorithms as well   most algorithms have some characteristic error pattern  and calibration can help alleviate those and improve fit beyond what the main regression algorithm can  and likewise  when predicting out of sample  especially if it's prediction of future outcomes based on past patterns   it's often necessary to adjust the predictions to compensate for the decay in accuracy due to going outside the original context  so again  calibrating on a hold out set  particularly if it's from a different context   for instance  if you hold out data from certain time periods or geographies  will improve the predicted values  i've been doing this manually for a long time with great results  and it could be really useful for others as well  as such  the request is to take the isotonic regression calibration method already implemented for classifiers and extend it to regressors  it should be a pretty straightforward adaptation  since very little code needs to be changed   i'd do it myself  but in all honesty i'm not much of a developer  hope that helps

hi  thanks for the quick reply  no  that does not really answer my question  if i have skf outside the loop  it seems that the lda or cross validation is doing something different depending on the sklearn version  for machine 1  sklearn 0 14  for example i got values around 0 25  which i would expect  since this is chance level  however on machine 2 and 3  sklearn 0 15 and 0 16  i get consistently values below chance level   between 0 13 and 0 16  i tested this on 700 datasets  each dataset with 10000 shuffles   so i thought that there might be something different with the newer versions  because it should be chance level as in the old sklearn version  when i put the skf in the loop  it is all fine  on all versions  about my dataset  i do not use any shrinkage  i actually just discovered that sklearn has that  do you recommend it  thank you  katharina
so my impromptu fix to the example was the correct way to go about it  good to know  i'm using anaconda with scikit learn 0 16 1 and python 3 4 3
i am using anaconda 2 3  python 3 4 3 64 bit windows 7   here is the code  here is the error message
0 15 1 and yes  it was fixed in the meantime  i updated the package and an exception is now raised when the first and second inputs' number of features do not match  so focused on reporting the issue i forgot to try the obvious  my bad  thanks you 
i found this problem because one of my baseline model had a auc score much higher then my expectation  the baseline model returned a result similar to my example above  the tie in the first threshold is the root cause  my suggestion is use the point  0  precision of the first threshold  as the most left end   0 1  will over estimate the auc  while  0  0  will under estimate it  the current metrics precision_recall_curve returns a curve with auc   0 5167  and the method based on my suggestion will return  p_fix    0 4  0 33333333  0 3333333  recall     1  0 5 0    auc   0 3498
also it were good to generalize mse to and abstract score  e g  r 2   like in this example http   scikit learn org stable auto_examples model_selection plot_train_error_vs_test_error html#example model selection plot train error vs test error py probably the best name would be  test_score_path   and error must be fed to a generalized score function
you are right  for some reason i have data that is a bunch of columns  but in one line for some reason there are more columns of data  which seems to be problematic  the error was not very clear  to me anyways   thank you 
oh that's very useful to know  i think it would be really useful to add to the documentation   along with the clarification about whether scikit learn uses  random seed    or  np random seed    by default  or both    and also a brief mention of side effects  presumably thread safety  and not sure what else  
what do you mean by constant vectors 
yes  just a moment 
this issue is that i think  this description  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob 3a9b3f5e6aa18a8ba35b4a53620803140d3c5992 sklearn linear_model coordinate_descent py#l1736  seems wrong  as the lasso doesn't use l2   also for  multitasklassocv here  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob 3a9b3f5e6aa18a8ba35b4a53620803140d3c5992 sklearn linear_model coordinate_descent py#l2033   but maybe i'm just mistaken and these functions should use l2  i've always though of lasso as just being adding l1 regularization  
hi  olologin  my data is from a kaggle contest  homesite   you could download from https   www kaggle com c homesite quote conversion data btw  the config of my computer is 4 cpu with ram 6400mb  os is ubuntu 14 04  thank you very much for your help 
ah  yes  that or  metrics normalized_mutual_info_score   i thought i must be missing something obvious 
hey there  the complete dataset covers more than 200 gb of disk space  i noticed the error does even appear with extreme downsampling  an example vector   as you can see  all values are float 
this is the traceback  a minimal example that reproduces this would likely run into 10s of gb  from what i can tell this issue is triggered when  j_indices  grows to a size larger than 2 31 1   j_indices  appears to grow to a length equal to the number of nonzero entries in the feature matrix 
hi all  thanks for the support  i replaced gmm with gausianmixture it works  yes  i use the chance to raise one other issue i found  i am reading the gmm parameters  means  covar     see my code above  directly from external gmm trained with htk  therefore after i initialize the class and directly set the parameters  i got this error  sklearn exceptions notfittederror  this gaussianmixture instance is not fitted yet  call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this method  but i dont want to fit the model  to make it work  i did a workaround   what is a recommended solution for that 
hi raghav  thanks for the prompt response  please find s_data attached  https   drive google com file d 0b8jznvuxsgyhq3lyvuwzme1hc2m view as for stopwords  it is comprised of the sandard nltk stopword corpus for english 
sure  i'm using the anaconda python distribution with sklearn 0 17 the file where the error is raised is  sklearn metrics cluster bicluster bicluster_metrics py 
i actually want to copy a class that contains the estimator as one of its attributes  so  sklearn base clone  doesn't help

hi  maniteja123  jnothman  well  as suggested by you i pulled the latest changes from the master  i ran the tests again and it does fine this time  but still i am not able to find an explanation as to why the test failed in the first place  and how does pulling latest changes from the master fix it  thanks  parth
 bernhard2202 yes  thank you  you beat me    
apparently the issue is my ability to read the docs     thanks

 amueller i'm sorry    array    is my spelling error  it should be   toarray      x_test_tfidf  is the tf idf representation of test samples  which is obtained via  tfidftransformer   
i met it in  a bit enlarged page chrome49，win7 thx and look forward to a better doc   
i think it should be in place shuffling to reduce memory consumption  if you do not want to break existing code using sklearn  you can provide such copy false option 
adding classes introduces complexity  i fully agree with that  but for me the benefits would have more impact    attributes are expressed clearly as attributes  and not encapsulated in a partial  as it can be seen in my previously shared class   which is in line with the estimator architecture    kernels can be stacked easily with subkernels  without passing always callables  but in line with metaestimators    kernels can be pipelined in front of an estimator and are therefore less coupled with the estimator code  which is semantically and architectural wise also useful for the multivariate issue     the weird overlap with the gaussian process kernels could be solved by partially merging them  also  nothing of this has to break any current code 
where we have noticed this issue is in a complex workflow involving proprietary data  so it will take a good bit of time and effort to come up with something that can be posted here  so yes  we can definitely work to set that up  but meanwhile i'm just trying to be sure that we're reading the docstring correctly    it _seems_ to say that the order is being randomized  deliberately       and if so that wouldn't depend on any particular application  but if it's _not_ deliberately being randomized within dbscan  then sure  we can try to track that down  which of course could be in our code or in the dbscan implementation 
i will prepare a pull request  glad to help 
a quick hack would also be very appreciated    i don't need any parallel support  or other fancy cv  would just dropping the  list  work  or  copy   tee  the split as mentioned in the other thread 
yes  i'll submit a pull request 
i know that timeseriessplit never makes predictions for the first part of the data set  but i'd expect it to handle all splitters  including timeseriessplit and cross_val_predict to return a list of predictions only on the predicted values  as long as for each record you have one prediction   i do see a problem since classification_report y  predicted  doesn't know on which values we have a prediction i'd change the last row to  predicted_start_index   list cv  0  0  0 +1 classification_report y predicted_index    predicted 
good question  a list of use cases would be    some scorer functions from  sklearn metrics  take additional arguments  for instance  the  multioutput  argument which appears in several regression metrics  e g    explained_variance_score   http   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn metrics explained_variance_score html#sklearn metrics explained_variance_score    the  average argument in several classification scoring functions  e g    precision_score   http   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn metrics precision_score html#sklearn metrics precision_score    or the  beta  parameter that appears in   fbeta_score   http   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn metrics fbeta_score html#sklearn metrics fbeta_score     most  all   functions from  sklearn metrics  have an optional  sample_weight  argument    custom metrics may take any arbitrary number of arguments  depending on the user's need  thanks for pointing out the related thread #4632  answering your  last point  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 4632#issuecomment 268051883  on that thread  i believe a  scorer_params  argument would be an unambiguous way to feed weights to the scorer function  indeed   fit_params  already does the same for the training algorithm  consequently  as far as i can tell    the functionalities of  fit_params  and  scorer_params  would be consistent   the argument names would be consistent and clear   it would be possible to unambiguously weight either the training data  the validation data  or both 
 amueller yes  i intentionally linked the if condition above that  because the code there assumes  n_values  should be by default 'auto'  so when it comes to the  else  condition  it does not need to do anything  the  handle_unknown 'ignore'  meaning "no legacy mode" mode is correct i think  because here the code is only checking for  n_values  and the current state  leading into "else condition"       n_values   'auto'   which is the bug here  which in itself can be ignored    handle_unknown 'ignore'  which is the current default  the older default was  'error'  further down  it checks for second deprecated property  categorical_features   where it again sets the legacy mode accordingly 
with a sparse matrix  my understanding was that the "missing" values are not actually missing  but just implicitly defined as 0's    thus still affecting the fit  i'm thinking about the case where the missing values are excluded from the objective function completely and do not affect the fit  i very well could be wrong though  and then that would indeed be a solution  and you're correct  i was thinking about just a few missing values  though i'm more concerned with what the algorithm is computing first  and then with speed second 
 lesteve sorry  i could not reproduce the error yet  however  the main part of code is   according to  this  https   stackoverflow com questions 8804830 python multiprocessing pickling error   there should be a problem with pipeline  best regards 
i think you are right  and was able to replicate what he expected  commented there 
 amueller thanks for the response  as i had pointed out in my original post  i was only referring to the class of algorithms where  for instance  you mentioned decision trees and i am myself working on refactoring the gmm so that it can be fit "naturally" without explicit imputation beforehand  obviously not all models will have a "natural" approach that is established and it would be best to leave those alone  but for the ones that do  or will have  it might be something worth considering 
maybe different issues should be opened with each of those points   the issue with joblib loading results coming from a previously cached deprecated version of a transformer sounds important too as long as it's not documented  i for one ended up writing a meta estimator  cachedtransformer  that would let me choose if i want to cache the  fit   the  transform  or both  and if both  fit_transform  too   the code is heavier like this but i rarely need to cache more than 1 or 2 transformers in a pipeline so i found it acceptable  both options sound very good

it looks like #9105 uses the r implementation as the specification  however  to actually match the mle found in tipping and bishop one needs to divide by n_samples  i wrote the script below to compare the implementation against the mle  it depends on what the specification is  it gives  loglik with bias  264 049958      always higher likelihood than the unbiased perturb improvement  0 000193      can't improve likelihood with random perturbation loglik without bias  264 179288 perturb improvement 0 024224      can improve likelihood with random perturbation biased delta to sklearn 0 129329      higher likelihood than sklearn so sklearn is not mle unbiased delta to sklearn 0 000000      using unbiased covariance matches sklearn
thanks  i did a quick search of issues but missed this  sorry for dup

i am using continuous features so numerical data  in my code python i define the decision tree as    dt decisiontreeclassifier random_state 1    so all features are used as it is in the java code  concerning samples  i define the same training and test data sets without using  train_test_split   i think all conditions are the same to produce the same result as the java code decision tree  in each time i modified the random_state  the result is modified as well  how to fix it please in order to obtain the same confusion matrix with java  in other words  how to remove the randomness aspect in the building of the decision tree in python  thank you a lot for your help 
quoting from  _the well calibrated bayesian_  a p  dawid  journal of the american statistical association  1982  https   scholar google fr scholar cluster 11888419095317220727   in the example model a is well calibrated for all the predicted probabilities  0  0 25  0 5  0 75 and 1  but model b is not well calibrated for probabilities 0 25 and 0 75 as 100  of predicted 0 25  resp  0 75  are in output class 0  resp  1   instead of 75  
the documentation is not wrong  it exactly matches the code  however  the formula seems to be incorrect  here is a code sample for n_features 6 and step 2   this will output   0 20538294 0 43691764 0 49075629 0 4861456    so we receive a score of 0 20538294 for when there is zero features left  is it the correct behavior  or there should be no score associated with 0 features  from where this score is coming 
nope  they're consistent then  ohh  months ago  when i first encountered this behavior  i suspected that could be the case and even dove into the source code to support this idea  but it was way over my head  i couldn't get to any conclusion  in any case  i just modified the function used the script above to account for this  the results support what you claim  thank you very much  i just checked   linear_model logisticregression 's documentation  https   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn linear_model logisticregression html  and i see no mention of the random state being modified  any chance you can pinpoint where in the code this is happening 
don't think i can dig into this anytime soon  but am guessing that whoever customized the docs build so heavily and impressively  to download datasets  render visualizations  etc   will be able to address this most efficiently 
great thanks  maybe  ogrisel would know 
https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob 55bf5d9 sklearn discriminant_analysis py#l130 when  shrinkage   'auto'    ledoit_wolf  is called once for every class 
in other words  when the perplexity is less positive  the score is more negative  normally  perplexity needs to go down  making it go down makes the score go down too  i believe that the gridsearchcv seeks to maximize the score  thus it doesn't work  i tried to multiply by  1 the output score by overriding the method  but it didn't work either  because the score method is used internally by the lda algorithm for something  if i remember well  the score was used internally for something like early stopping  so inverting score as a quick fix didn't work  if i did no mistakes here and if my assumptions are right  then the score would need a refactoring for the lda to be useable by gridsearchcv  and or else providing good alternative metrics for scoring this unsupervised algorithm would be a good thing too 
yes  this seems like the appropriate forum for reporting bugs in spacy   
hi joel  i'd like to handle this case because it isn't completely clear from the documentation  the equations used to explain the behaviour of the function do not require the use of the diagonal entries  yet they are still involved in the calculation  likely this is for ease of implementation and speed  thanks for the tip about 0 2  i have updated now  and updated the original issue text  
thanks for getting back  the scikit learn version i am using is is 0 19 1 
it doesn't work for 0 19 either 
should have a pr up shortly 
the idea is the following  suppose we have some estimator param1 none  param2 none  that implements  fit  and  predict  and has a fitted attribute  result_  now the wrapper  providing some compatibility methods  is constructed as estimatorwrapper estimator estimator  param1 none  param2 none  this wrapper  apart from the  estimator  parameter  behaves exactly like the original  estimator  class  i e  it has the attributes  param1  and  param2   calls  estimator fit  and  estimator predict  and  when fitted  also has the attribute  result_   the reason i want to store the  estimator  as its class is to make it clear to the user that any parameter changes are to be done on the wrapper and not on the wrapped estimator  the latter should only be constructed "on demand" when one of its methods is called  i actually do provide a mixin mechanism  but the problem is that each sklearn estimator would then need a dedicated class that subclasses both the original estimator and the mixin  actually  multiple mixins  one for each estimator method   in the long term  i plan to replicate all sklearn estimators in this manner so they can be used as drop in replacements when imported from my package  but for now it's a lot easier to use a wrapper  also for user defined estimators   now i'm not an expert in python oop  so i don't claim this is the best way to do it  but it has worked for me quite well so far  i do understand that you would not want to support a fringe case like this  regarding the potential for user error when classes and instances are both allowed as parameters  in that case  i think that  clone  should at least be more verbose about why it fails when trying to clone classes 
ok  i will propose a pr for this

thanks for the quick feedback  here is a reproducible example  https   scikit learn org stable auto_examples ensemble plot_forest_importances html but  please  just disable the   random_state   parameter  and also the   informative feature    you'll see from the plot that  at each execution  the rank of most of features except the two firsts  is changing  yes  when i set the random state to a constant value  the above is no more occurring  but how it could be interpreted   i mean  logically  a good feature should stay a good feature even if we randomize shuffle the data each time  i can understand that some features could change due to this randomization  but not all of them  and by this way  how could we determine the reel usefulness of a feature  since it is really correlated to how the data is positioned at the beginning  
is that something to with ellipsis  result of the dot should create a new variable 
issue resolved  the source code i used for this particular project had some incorrect array conversions that resulted in this error 
no  #12264 is not my case but it is desirable too  i would like  ordinalencoder  do not throw an exception if it meets an unexpected value  i mean that unexpected value is value which  categories  does not contain 
yes  i have clang installed and set up its path by the introduction given by the official document of scikit learn
 jnothman  aditya1702 thank you both for looking into it   aditya1702 go ahead  thanks 
this was a test code  what i am trying to do is replicate the 'n_values' parameter setting with 'categorical' parameter  e g  if i am trying to one hot encode the 'n' number of distinct data points  i would need 'n' categories beforehand even if i have only 3 categories to onehotencode now

hey  i haven't realised that it is due to the performance reasons  i think it might be useful to add a brief note  if it is not already there  but i can't find it  to the documentation or the error message as you have said 
the  gridsearchcv does not take any  fit_params  dictionary  an error like this occurs  typeerror  fit   got an unexpected keyword argument 'fit_params'  when you pass the dictionary to the  fit    method as established in the documentation e g   clf fit x  y  fit_params  'sample_weight' dataset_transf_train instance_weights    the way that worked for me was passing directly the object as the estimator was expecting  like this  clf fit x  y  sample_weight dataset_transf_train instance_weights   no dictionary involved there from  string    object  the documentation is not clear in that sense

thank you for your feedbacks  i'm a bit bothered by this answer because  isn't that what using semantic versioning is for  to guarantee users that there is no breaking changes  from what i understand of pickling for classes  see https   docs python org 3 library pickle html#pickle inst   this is not about code change  but about structural change  if you add or rename a field in a class  then you can't unpickle a previous class version  so this would be called a breaking change  if you change the code from a method  no problem there  i understand that there are no automatic way to guarantee "no breaking pickle changes"  but that's why people use semantic versioning  because the human developers were careful when they versioned their artefact to respect the rules of semantic versioning  that being said  i would understand that as a team you decide not to honour the semantic versioning contract concerning pickling  this is a valid choice  but it is still a choice  not something out of the team control 
it is not reproducible with the last stable numpy version  1 18 1  
sorry for the ambiguity  i meant to say "split criteria" as in mse  gini  mae  etc i have updated the issue name and original comment accordingly  i am currently working on a comparison example

i did not know about onnx export  that might just work  looks like they  cover  http   onnx ai sklearn onnx supported html#l converter list  all the ones i currently need for this project  i'll need to check if this works with grpc but this might be sufficient to get away from pickle 
yeah  i guess you're right  i'd been doing that in a few plugins and it seemed like a lot of string markup to write out each time  but then there's so much customization needed per part that it may not simplify much  closing

hi todd  never really used jsbin before but i guess this is right  this sample should show a simple demo to demonstrate what i'm trying to say  http   jsbin com opipu3 basically the simple demo i linked doesn't have the icons included because of linking but that's my problem not jquery mobile  it just demonstrates the issue of the 60  width of the textbox 
looks good on latest here too 
it does work now  thnx
i know that in the 2nd alpha version of the code the submit button works  but i'm using the latest version of the source code located at  https   github com jquery jquery mobile and that's the one that does no work
confirmed  just cloned the latest repo and it is resolved with the latest build  will go ahead and close this ticket

thanks for the template  it was helpful  visit http   jsbin com acade3 7   click on the button to go the next page  on the next page  click on the back button to go back to the previous page  the transition animation is not in reverse even though   reverse true   is specified in the     mobile changepage     call  for some reason  the link on the first page does not load the second page with ajax  i suspect that may be a jsbin thing and is unrelated to this issue  thanks 
 toddparker  in regards to touchoverflow  i tried to enable this on the ipad  unfortunately the listviews do not render when they scroll into view  on an iphone it was my intention to avoid a scrolling div  the page contains only one div  as there is no scroll bar and it is confusing for the user 
done  thanks
i retested and can still reproduce this on android 2 3 4 and 2 2 1  running http   code jquery com jquery 1 6 min js with http   code jquery com mobile latest jquery mobile js
this would work as a workaround  is this the way it was meant to work  or should it respect the _self value and open it in the same window 
yes  it works    however  the test page uses jquery 1 6 1  and i noticed that if i upgrade to 1 6 1 in my application  it works fine with jquery mobile 1 0a4 1  i was using jquery 1 6  so i can't say if the bug was fixed in jquery mobile master or not  as upgrading jquery to 1 6 1 seem to fix the bug as well 
i agree with  scottjehl  likely a "best practices" type of recommendation  i'd love to see this type of thing start to get built out    namely surrounding swatch templates  themeing  common jquery mobile design patterns  etc   
i see now that the docs in  test point people to the right option  the only place i can see autobackbtn is in the latest post at http   jquerymobile com blog  maybe someone could change that  tnx steven
sure  here you go  http   jsbin com evuga3 4 edit
the problem with the tablets is the have a click sound whenever they even touch the screen  the human ear registers a "hit" but the actual contact doesn't occur  so yeah  they are missing the x button by a small margin 
just downloaded and installed safari 5 0 5 and i still have the same issue  when i select one of the values the text in the selectbox does get updated  when i look in the dom the child  option  elements do have text in them  so i think it's very likely that they're transparant  edit  accidentally pressed the close button   
i do see rounded corners on the demo  i am using safari for windows 
not working with the latest either  http   jsbin com uholi6 6
i'm seeing this in android 2 1 on our galaxy s and in the simulator  it doesn't happen in the 2 3 3 simulator though 
this has been tested on 2 2 and 3 0  on 7 12 11 7 50 am  "toddparker" reply reply github com wrote 
it is  in feature request   navigation   "event before the page is loaded"  i did as we asked me when we discussed https   github com jquery jquery mobile pull 2151#issuecomment 1709291
yes i did like this    "#mylistid"  listview 'refresh'   still not working 
ah  i think i know what the issue is  i am using dreamweaver cs5 5 and when creating a jquery mobile page it sets you up with all of the images you need  i believe they must have been using an older version when this was implemented 
ppatoray  yes  i have set   i commented the above line out and enabled ajax  now the list elements no longer stay active and work as expected  the issues seems to be only when ajaxenabled is set to false

follow the link  http   jsfiddle net hxsl8 
http   jsfiddle net qheqn  you'll see "  none" as header above the options 
try it from an ios5 device like an iphone or ipod touch  ipad wont work with out more content  the issue is that the two buttons wont show until you touch them  this happens in the demos online too 
here is the default output of an asp net checkbox control that is set to perform an automatic postback   on the other hand i may be over simplifying things 
now  to figure out why it also fails to close    
thanx for the reply  i'll test it out as soon as i can get this old thing on wifi  stay tuned 
yes  the script styles are the the head seaction  i'm setting up a less complex page to illustrate my point  i'l get back to you once i have this done  on mon  oct 24  2011 at 2 45 pm  todd parker   reply reply github com wrote 
i have not yet tried jquery 1 6 4  will try this next   i haven't tried an older version of jqm yet  no  it doesn't work on an actual device   basically the same result except that the phonegap logo screen stays on the screen about 5 seconds before it all goes white 
no i have not demonstration of problem  but i see what on jquery mobile demos it's make same i use navabar  may be all problem about scrollview experimental  what i use

hi  it is fixed in the latest version of jquery  1 1 0  
i tried with those latest releases and all is still broken  i should probably have been more specific in that this is only occurring in the ipad  it's not happening in either firefox or safari on the mac   those are working fine  i won't have a chance to post any code until tomorrow eve  but i could do so then   thanks   joe
i pasted my markup above already
binding on select breaks functionality on the desktop  no audio is played   and on the android browsers things remain broken 
sorry  no time for more    i sorry  really  i will try debug it soon  regards
safari 6 0 2  8536 26 17  on os x 10 8 2  12c3006   issue occurs also in safari on ios 6 0 2  that's probably less configuration specific 
sure  here is an example  please note that the "bug" happens when using an iphone  and afaik  on other mobile devices too   i had no issues with firefox for os x  http   jsbin com otepum 41
sure thing as soon as i get a moment    thanks for your help btw   have updated accordingly  i also hope that perhaps this could expand to more than just the listview icons  i'll see when i get round to the github pull request
 ugomobi it worked well when i set ajaxenabled   false or manually set data ajax false on all the links  ill look into the ignorecontentenabled method when i have access to my comp 
 ugomobi it still happens in your version  the tool bar keep on shaking all the time when scrolling the page  see the video below which i made just right now  http   viddy it opdb1o  new ipad 5 1 1   mauriceg also i mean the text 'issue template' in the demo move just 0 5px maybe all the time when you are scrolled the page

i just tried the ' test docs ' link on both ipad 2 and iphone 5 and it does now seem to open and keep open the popups   which is good  however  on closing the popup it seems to refresh the 'previous' page in its entirety  i e  screen goes blank as if doing a non ajax reload and page position is lost  rather than just hiding the popup  also  as a weird side note the original '1 2 0' link i posted yesterday now seems to behave the same as the 'test' link on the ipad 2  i e  popup stays open but seems to reload page on close  however on the iphone 5 the '1 2 0' link still seems to immediately hide the popup after opening  i've often seen the ' test ' documentation links in search results and wondered what they are  is this the latest in progress code that has not yet been released 
i tested it in samsung galaxy s ii with android 4 0 3 also tested in sony xperia arc with android 4 0 4 tested in android's default browser

hi  yes it would be possible to wrap the whole page in the form but unfortunately it would be a pretty "ugly" way to do so  because we are using symfony and dont want to modify the main "template" just because of this "bug"   a field container should float the label left of the input field and change the width of the input field if there is enough space for that  in a popup it does none of that   it just looks like there wouldnt be a field container around it in any way  i guess both problems could be fixed by not moving the contents of my popups to an other place in the markup and just let it where i set it in the html

hi  thanks a lot for your answer  i've tested your page  and no scrollbar on the browser  android or mac  but when i build it with phonegap and launch the app on my nexus 4  or galaxy tab   the scrollbar appears with each slide transition  is it a phonegap issue then   have you got any idea of what can cause this   thanks a lot

i'm sorry but i didn't know about the   data    function  i believe this feature is redundant 
 jaspermdegroot i tested on safari of iphone 6  android 5 1 1 and emulator on chrome 52 example    at step 2  you open "no transition" popup   at step 3  you close "no transition" popup by click on "  flow  "   at step 4  you must open "  flow  " again notes  the   popup type   at step 3 and step 4 must   same  
 aheckmann   that's what i feared  do you know if this is on the roadmap or if this is just something that isn't widely needed   tootallnate   right  that's the default  problem is with mixed you lose all the validation schema stuff that you get with supported  named keys   arrays  embedded docs 
hmm   its working now for me  donno what happened  maybe i was doing something wrong  i'll review a couple other scenarios where i queried for an object instead of using a stored string and see if those work as well  
sure https   gist github com 1348429
legacy   
 er88  thanks for your reply  but when the string is an ip address  how to do it  transform it to number  i don't think it is a good resolve method  in mongodb  i can use  gt with string type to do compare  i think it is very useful 
i don't know why the test would pass while my application would fail  all i can tell you is that if you plunk those debugging lines into  query prototype fields   when you pass an object  it doesn't evaluate as an object  i'm beyond my so called expertise here  but it seems like  obj constructor    object  might be a buggy test condition    it obviously works as intended in certain contexts  which includes the tests   but for some reason is not working in the context of an application  i'll add an example as soon as i get a chance 
i'm running 2 2 3  after i changed the field name in my schema  i discovered that  _id  and  id  are colliding during  find  operations  so that  id     _id  in the returned documents 
looks like this is actually the result of a bad value for date 
sorry  mistake on example  var where    'ptr' '123'  'txt' 'foo'  'obj all txt'  bla    i´m was using regexp on txt  if string used it works fine  but not with regexp
no i've found that the problem was in increasing limit of ram  after i add swap file i get a success 
i'm afraid i haven't been able to create a small sample test  that being said  it works on 4 9 5 and fails on 4 9 6  unsure what change there could have affected it 
the saving of the document arrays was complex and required a dup check which returned an error on match  so i handled that logic before i saved the parent object  but the parent would then try to resave the doc arrays again and fail when a dup error was returned  i would like to tell the parent object to not worry about saving the document arrays and just trust the data it gets  bascily like a lazysave sort of option 
i'll work something up 
sure

tracing of fields
i think yes  thanks for advice 
for example i have field  name   for user it is not required to set it  so it can be  undefined   but if user set it  i want to check that it is not empty string  currently as a workaround i add validator that simply check that  value     ''  
right you are  i was running 2 7 1  upgraded and this works perfectly  on mon  nov 19  2012 at 1 09 pm  aaron heckmann notifications github comwrote 
created the object in the database via native mongo driver or manually   added collection  fs files as option 
unfortunately   virtual s it is just local solution that is not associated with the data in the database 
in a express restful service my models should validate that the database is available  no retry  no wait   if not  they should respond an dberror to the controller which send the response error to the client 
it seems to me like any schema i created after a certain point updated fine and a select few wouldn't update properly  i'm thinking i changed the schema or inserted into the database using  set and not  push for the arrays  i no longer have the code anyways  weird git app error   i'll consider the matter closed for now and reopen if i run into it later with some working code 
 vkarpov15 thank you for the quick response  yes  i think i can shine some light on that  i'm doing this through a  baucis  https   github com wprl baucis  rest api  so all of the magic happens in the source of that library  the data for the update  in this case  the complete model for a fund  is serialized as json on the client and sent to baucis as a put request   here is the line  https   github com wprl baucis blob master controller query update js#l150  where the json   context incoming   is set on the document  using   doc set   http   mongoosejs com docs api html#document_document set    and in the next step of the pipeline  it calls  doc save   one thing i'm afraid of is that i might have to do some sort of separate tracking of deletions  adds  and edits on the client  which could get fairly complex  right now  the user plays with the form and that just manipulates the underlying  backbone  model  with no need to worry about anything but the final result when they click  save   i will work on a test example this evening 
thanks for fixing it  i didn't know that it was unstable branch  we are currently migrating from using 2 8  and i found this bug during the migration  so it hasn't affected any production data  fortunately  we have a very good test coverage  i suppose that 3 6 is the stable branch  so i will move the migration to it 
 refack yes  that should be good 
 vkarpov15 in the end i had to stay with my custom logic because if i did something like this   being challenge find async a different request could have called user tojson   in the meantime with the wrong minimize option  but it's really an edge case so don't worry if you don't want to implement it  i probably wouldn't since it's so easy to recreate the populate method manually 
3 8 23
yep   i don't know where it came from  so just remove it right 
yea we ended up doing something along those lines  it was just an unfortunate work around because the method iterated through a bunch of fields on a model and it didn't know in advance which of them were going to be populated models and which were going to be fields  we couldn't call  toobject    on everything since that would remove the method if it were a model and not a normal object 
 vkarpov15 no  as i said  the getters aren't being called when i use modename find callbackname error  docs       any other functions that return just one doc  like findone  findbyid  etc  call the getters  in order to use apply the getters to the documents returned by find  i have to do something like this  modelname find function err  docs    for var i in docs  docs i  toobject  getters   true       
here's a query that's causing the issue  you're right  it's an aggregation 
hum  i'm not sure i understand  do you mean  stream   then   note that the  handler  for  stream on 'data'  handler   returns a promise thus the documents can be processed sequentially  i use  pause resume  to achieve the expected result  so the final result would look something like this 
sorry for the delay  actually  i'm just trying to use promises with it to avoid nesting  i think that a snippet wouldn't help much 
 vkarpov15 i wanna insert data into shard collections by calling mongodb storage function    db eval   js function        but it's error   can't call  db eval    with shard collections    how can i achieve it  sorry for my bad english 
i found a solution on stackoverflow   http   stackoverflow com questions 7267102 how do i update upsert a document in mongoose delete model _id     important cramodel update  userid  req user id  month  model month  year  model year   model   upsert  true   function err          
it's a c sharp program  each client will create a tcp connection to our game server  and it will use that connection to call the apis of our game service which is a nodejs application 
yes  whenever a test runs  each test of hundreds   i establish a database connection  then i do  mongoose connection db dropdatabase done    and run my tests  the problem is that dropping the database destroys the collections  mongoose  automatically created  and when the next test comes along   mongoose  re creates the collections where needed  but it doesn't run  ensureindex  again
 vkarpov15 thanks  silly mistake on my part  i ended up making a new collection for the userid's and permissions which i think is a better architecture anyway 
i'm using the latest available version of mongoose  3 8 24  
8 1
here is it  new section   
this has been reproduced using 4 0 2 and 3 8 0  i thought that maybe the 'post' property name might interfere with the post and pre hooks  i tried renaming the field to 'post1' and populating but the same results are encountered  this issue is blocking us from releasing a crucial update to production so if you could provide any guidance as where you think the issue might be in the source we can try and investigate to get the issue resolved quickly 
i'm sorry  i forgot to mention the version  it's  4 0 1 
https   mongoosejs com docs api html#model_model distinct i found that this is the only place with this description  so it may be old      someone who may knows about promise  but he didn't know he didn't need to write callback while he was using await  because he didn't know what the 'callback' here exactly is  maybe it is an individual case    i think  this  https   mongoosejs com docs queries html  may be useful if he knows that the 'callback' of model distinct is the 'callback' in the document of 'queries' 
updated 😉  you need to execute the example a second time to see the error
you're right  it will complain about duplicates in the root doc  but with a root doc you don't have the possibility to omit it completely  like with single subdouments   your approach means that we have to include knowledge about where we use a schema inside the schema  from a software architecture and encapsulation point of view this seems a bit odd but maybe there's no better way

mongodb server version   v2 6 10  
sorry  i should have mentioned the version  i'm on mongoose 4 1 1  i was trying the array example shown here http   mongoosejs com docs api html#model_model create
the code sample in #3284 is exactly what's happening  however we do the pre save hook within a mongoose plugin on the  childschema   does #3284 fix that if it is hooked within plugins 
i actually think i just figured this out  not at bug at all  there was a race condition in my code that would cause mongoose createconnection   to be called multiple times  thus  would caused the extra pools to be opened  it might be a nice to throw a console warning for this scenario   anyways this can be closed 
mongoose file is causing the issues on sun  oct 18  2015  10 24 pm valeri karpov notifications github com wrote 
my bad  i had an issue in my own code causing this issue  i still do not really understand why the stacktrace was refering to mongoose code but whatever  thanks 
sure  it seems to be 2 6 8   i guess this might be a mongodb issue and not mongoose 
so i presume this is how some of the events propagate  from _mongodb core_  https   github com christkv mongodb core blob ea9c6e6b86a32af79a714e5a3d8d3cd0ac5441ca lib connection pool js#l10 l13  _  also here  https   github com automattic mongoose blob 4d7de47f4961c44373713e07f265304d8af09db8 lib drivers node mongodb native connection js#l142  and a bunch of other places _    right  i'm trying to validate our usage of  error  event and find the  join   etc   from that project mentioning  https   github com christkv mongodb core issues 66#issuecomment 165052045   it's a little difficult to find in a    grep  since there are hundreds of results    i even kept _npm_ 2 x so i could search easier since it's not "flat" dependencies like _npm_ 3 x is  so basically i'm asking whose events are  we trapping here  https   github com openuserjs openuserjs org blob 674ca106f3a1ed4ab71aaf261f6357d5f98bcd17 app js#l89 l111       are these _mongoose_ only generated or everything under the object itself  which includes _mongoose_  including the mongo core drivers  as you linked above that doesn't contain  timeout    join  and  left     nor does it contain  error    open   etc  so that's what i'm looking for is the total summary of all events supported and on which object unless it "bubbles upwards" to the parent object of  db     e g  can we trap it at the "top level"  db  identifier or do we need to dive into the connection  randoming guessing and testing is taking it's toll  ahh that's a little different than what i found digging through the web but i will give that a whirl with some tests  thanks for your responses    and if i don't hear back before the holiday that is kosher too    
i suppose a simple ide plugin would be fine  but if we just had a trail that any ide could follow  using a strongerly typed schema  it'd be 1 stone and multi birds 
 vkarpov15 i need to dynamically change the name of the collection  using validation of the model
 vkarpov15 thank you for your quick reply  namedscope is meant to chain static constructor like below    ref  http   stackoverflow com questions 11863635 chaining static constructor in mongoose like scope in rails 11869563#11869563
thank you for your reply  i use limit and skip as options parameter like this  product find     ' __v  updatedat'    lean  true  skip  skip  limit  limit  sort  sort    function  err  results    do stuff      everything work fine in mongo 3 0 but when i change to 3 2  error occur and display something like skip and limit must be numeric  but when i cast to numeric everything work well  it ok if i just cast to number  but i curious why it work on mongo 3 0 but doesn't work on mongo 3 2  i use mongoose 4 3 5  thank you 
 vkarpov15   sorry and let me repeat with an example  there are two models  user  and  post   the schema is   it's something dirty because i have to re transform every models that reference  user  model  thank you 
the error is in a  find   query  by 'try to populate a null ref' i mean those refs could exists or not  i don't touch that chapter x  _id 
sorry for the  if  distraction  d anyway you're right about the value  with  undefined  it doesn't throw the error  but when i search for the saved doc  through an express rest service  i still get the empty arrays on the fields item1 item2 item3  
so the right way to register  doc  as inherited model of the model  casenote  is simply  var docschema   casenote discriminator 'doc'  docschema_raw   var doc   mongoose model 'doc'     just to be sure   
db posts find   returns the same as the output above  so i guess the data isn't even saving  i am saving data from a post request  i am getting back the "post created" response when creating a new object but the title and content do not show up in the post response either  i'm guessing that is because the data is not saving 
okay thanks
i fixed the issue  was caused by a moongoose plugin populating the array 
i have also created an ticket for nunjucks repo  will let you know about the results 
## edit  seems like it may be a pebcak issue    investigating    i'll comment again if to explain ok  so more details  i spun up an additional ubuntu machine  installed mongo and tested the code  it worked fine   i documented the entire process below  everything worked until after i secured the server  then _no_ account can create records with  insertmany   through the node code  however  i can authenticate through robomongo and perform manual insertmany   commands  there is definitely a permissions issue going on  i am attempting to bulk insert documents into a  devices  collection  and that is failing using the  dataload  account which is dbowner  and i would assume that would have permissions  ## mongoose configuration code 
does this mean it is from mongodb driver  
i already deleted  2 4  but i guess it built the index  because querying the index with  db items getindexes    showed the index correctly   i also checked the sparse index with  robomongos  index property  it doesn't show everything in detail but the index seemed to exist  i always dropped the collection first and this was the only index besides _id which was created 
 vkarpov15    bulk   this model 'feeditem'  collection initializeunorderedbulkop   
seems you're right  sorry  my bad  after executing  mongoose connect   i used the  mongoose  object instead of  mongoose connection  as  options connection   from reading the docs i was under the impression that those are basically the same 
ok i will try to clarify my problem hopping im not wasting your time   i dont understand why after the second addset  i get a duplicate object in my objectarray even if in the db it wont be saved 
yes strange    it actually works fine with the  settimeout     i post this issue just because it does not seem to be a correct behavior  in my case  connection is triggered from the renderer process and done in the main process  so i do not want to block the renderer  if there are more informations i can provide  just tell me 
wow   thank you so much for this answer   i can't describe how much i appreciate it  i'm so sorry i didn't answer right away  i just finished exam period  yes   it works   the validators are triggered   you're great   i still have some questions  it would be great if you could answer them   1  _race condition_   by "_think about what happens when you have two docs trying to save at the same time and both get back an empty user _" you mean that  lets say that there is 2 sign up requests  both contains the same email address  if they happen so close to each other  my server just created 2 users with the same address  so what would be safe approach  the only thing that come to my mind is to save one  and then on 'post' hook search if there is older user with the same address  if so  delete the new instance    but still i can think on ways to fail this scenario too   any guidelines     2  i'm sorry  but when you wrote "return this model findone  email  value    exec  " instead of  it doesn't really works for me  in your scenario  "this" is already a model object  so its like saying model model  i tried to dig in  but i couldn't find findone   i found  but at this constructor  which is bad practice   ​ 3    updating an object inside array wont trigger the array validator     i have this property in my user schema photos     type  schema objectid  ref  photos      everytime i save a photo  i do  for exampe   set when update    photos 5   currentphoto   5 is the index at the array  and it does save succesfuly     but i want to always check in the user that the array doesn't cross the max_photos  so i do this   photos    type     type  schema objectid  ref  photos     validate   photoslimit  ' path  exceeds the limit of 5'     or this   userschema path 'photos'  validate photoslimit  both validator won't trigger  and i guess i know why   its because i update the object inside the array and not the array itself   this works   photos     type  schema objectid  ref  photos  validate   photoslimit  ' path  exceeds the limit of 5'          even tried 'req user markmodified 'photos'  ' right before the update  didn't work 🙊  how can i trigger the array validator when i update only one of his objects     on sat  jun 4  2016 at 2 27 am  valeri karpov notifications github com wrote 
 simllll good point  however  is there even a valid use case for  countdocuments  without a query parameter  i mean  under what circumstances would one actually want to do a full scan when just wanting the document count metadata from the collection  i really think this is going to hurt a lot of people as it stands  in the documentation  there's the  count  method that they're used to and familiar with  but they're told it's deprecated  right below it in the documentation  there's  countdocuments   with _word for word the same documentation_ as  count   they're used to running a no argument  count  to get the document count from some very large  for argument's sake  let's say billions of documents  collection  the documentation doesn't give any indication that a no argument  countdocuments  is going to be absolutely disastrous for them 
if i remove the   modelschema pre 'find' function next   this where   isvalid   true    populate 'background'   next       the same result  "background is null" i got
i probably should have noted the first thing i tried doing was upgrading to 4 5 10  i'm currently on 4 5 9   but i get a  rangeerror  maximum call stack size exceeded  detailed in this issue  #4466  so i can't confirm if 4 5 10 fixes the issue 
 adambuczynski fair enough  not sure the root of why i'm experiencing this  will investigate and re open if i find anything  thanks all 
mongodb 'v3' no  there is no non alphanumeric symbols 
 varunjayaraman unfortunatelly  only this error logged    i have tons of operations in database and i don't know  where and when happened   
not yet
it would be nice if i had a list  but i just found this one and reported 
 varunjayaraman  i consoled req params areas but it just showed 'areas'  my thought on this is that mongoose can't possibly figure out how to query for a property in a mongodb collection because the parameter  req params areas supplied to the find function does not tell mongodb to filter out the areas from the collection unlike in sql where a similar statement might read select   collection where area  req params areas  this is just for demonstration purpose   in this case req params areas is ambiguous that is why mongodb returned empty array  unlike req query where supplied params is actually a value that mongodb can relate to  my workaround to this issue was to find all documents and did a forloop to get the area per document  please somebody should quote me wrong 
what isn't to understand there  you'll get the the deprecationwarning because of an unhandled promise rejection if db is not connectable  in future versions of node the application will crash  i'd like to handle the db not available in my application code  for example to retry or connect a different db for example  it looks like you are calling a promisified mongodb core function during mongoose connect which doesn't catch all possible errors and doesn't put it in the error parameter of the connect callback 
it looks like mongoose autopopulate can do what i was looking for  for now  i decided not to use middleware for this  but i realized that while trying to boil this down  i lost track of the reason i first started looking into merging queries in the first place  here's a better example   the hook part is actually irrelevant  it is just multiple calls to populate the same path  with newer calls overwriting the older one  i was a little surprised by that  i'm not sure anymore that i want that behavior changed in the way i proposed  but maybe making it clear in the docs 
the discriminatores doesn't look helpful  i just try out the  mongoose autopopulate  https   github com mongodb js mongoose autopopulate  plugin   const metaschema   schema   user    type  schema types objectid  ref  'user'  autopopulate  true     this also does not work   it looks like this plugin also using the find findone pre hooks which are not available in a nested schema  again  i know how to populate the nested schema from the parant schema  because of using the nested schema a thousend times  with different pathes and always the same populate behavior  i'm looking for a shorter way

yes  thanks   property encryption decryption is doable with both virtuals and getters setters without any difficulties  virtual seems the most elegant way to achieve this feature  but it's just my personal opinion  
sure  i'll post the actual mongoose file when i get home 
sorry  i should have been more clear  this breaks starting from 4 4 10 up including to the latest version  4 13 4   i've just tried to narrow down the release when it started to break and was able to "blame" 4 4 10 
i want to save embedded docs as a hash object
okay   lineus  i want to be sure that  subschema  document exists  so i'm using to check it in both pre validate and pre findbyidandupdate middlewares  pre validate case works as expected  but  findbyidandupdate  with   runvalidators  true  context  'query'   doesn't run nested validation  subschema pre 'validate'    p s   findoneandupdate  doesn't run aswell 
 vkarpov15  thanks  makes sense i guess  i think i got set to the mindset something was wrong by finding other related issues with virtual populate and null values  like   https   github com automattic mongoose issues 4278  https   github com automattic mongoose issues 4278   but that seems to describe a different scenario  can be closed now 
thanks for your reply  that workaround sounds sufficient however i have since settled with making that change manually outside of the mongoose object for now  feel free to close this issue unless you think it would be useful for someone else to stumble upon  thanks 
hi lineus  firstly  this is the code i was using  i wasn't using promise chains    so while the callback method will work to catch errors on initial connection  neither that method nor the event emitters seem to work when the database loses connection after it has initially connected  hopefully that makes sense   p s     thanks for rick rolling me 
yes   the ids in both collection will be unique in my scenario and this solution works  thanks for the clarification 
 vkarpov15 my program logic is not complicated  and should not make cpu 100

thanks for the quick response  will open an issue there now  i have a bunch of stacktraces like these   and you can sort of see the frequency here in my sentry logs    screen shot 2018 08 15 at 11 26 44  https   user images githubusercontent com 1151860 44144151 4caa1540 a07e 11e8 9388 7570e7198062 png    screen shot 2018 08 15 at 11 26 12  https   user images githubusercontent com 1151860 44144152 4cd53f4a a07e 11e8 82c6 60d446c73c8c png  operations are usually very quick  when using the mongodb database profiler and monitoring over a few minutes period only 1 or 2 queries took   5ms  i've not bumped the  poolsize  up greater than 50 so far as i would like to get rid of the authentication errors before bumping this up 
well  if the field already has an assigned value  what is the need of calling the default  it could be a problem if the function takes a long time to execute  or if it throws errors  i e  a function that generates a unique token and that throws an error after three failed attempts   when the  user  is created  it can make sense  but during a  findone  it be unexpected 
like mongoose is implemented in entirely javascript promise right  and when you create a virtual you can call promise chain  set  get on that     where can i see that api for  set  getter implementations  vkarpov15

i fixed the issue  basically the code wasn't causing the problem  the issue originated from using the mongodb atlas free tier  with mondodb 4 0 5 the issue was fixed  more details here  https   stackoverflow com questions 54003801 multi document transactions not working using mongodb atlas

i try to connect by using robo and i can't connect too  now i think it's happen when i change ip in ip whitelist  after the status was active  i try to connect it again  it will can't connect  and i don't know why and how long sometime i can connect

i answered my question on stackoverflow  basically mongoose is doing the correct thing  as i send an array of subdocuments with my document  mongoose will interpret all of those as new instances of a new subdocument  and this is correct as for an update i would have to supply a query  now i could update each of those subdocuments individually but that would also mean that i have to make a seperate method to sort out which subdocuments in the array have been added  removed  moved etc  more detail on stackoverflow  in short  this one can be closed  however it would be a nice feature if mongoose could somehow handle such arrays and decide which subdocuments are already there and just need to be updated  which ones need to be removed and which ones are added
i will work on a simple re produceable example as my code has a lot of structure too it and reply 
that would be helpful yes  thank you  will it be possible to override the creation process or just add pre creation commands

if the mongodb driver docs say it's only on initial connection then i suppose you're fine  the use case i was thinking of was for reconnects  there may be some stuff you want to do only when you've connected  or reconnected in this case  to a primary and at least one secondary  and listening to this event could've been a way to do that if it was emitted on reconnect 
 vkarpov15 yes  if i comment out  await db disconnect      i'm ending up with the following exception  as you can see in the snippet above  my reconnect is invoked _only_ from within the  reconnectfailed  event listener  the repro on my side is easy    start the application with mongodb running  in my case  that's a local docker container    pause the mongodb container   wait until reconnects fail and  reconnectfailed  is invoked  then try to connect again  as in the snippet above  i guess the big difference is how you "kill" mongodb or the network  in my case the "pause docker container"  
it's mean deploy project to  meteor galaxy    digitalocean        
my favorite collection indexes are as follows  then i realized that all collection 'find' commands work in this way  other collections are not recognized because they are not indexed  i tested them with normal find and runcommand times are the same  i think runcommand doesn't use index

neilness submitted  strange  i first noticed this issue in a fresh install of 2 0 0 pl  and i'm still having the issue after upgrading to 2 0 3 pl  i've tested on the latest versions of mac chrome  firefox    safari  and windows chrome  firefox and ie  sure thing  1  edit context     access permissions     edit  or create new  individual entry 2  change access policy to " no policy "  note  if you do not changing the blank "access policy" field  it will not allow you to save  only if you specifically set it to " no policy "  3  click save     "saving" popup     grid tries to refresh  says "loading" indefinitely 4  after refreshing the page  no entries show up in the grid  and you cannot add new entries  5  if you delete the entry in the database  or change it to a value   0  the grid will display again in the manager  if you'd like to try on my install  i've created test accounts for the manager and phpmyadmin  and i can email the log in details  also   important  i noticed that if you follow the above steps in a context other than "web"  the context disappears from the resource tree  and you get an "access denied" error 
xpix submitted  i thought this should work without the "switch context" plugin  now that i configured the plugin it works  thank you
netdoctor submitted  i had it set to 64 so that was not it  i tried it on a ubuntu hardy heron server and it worked  so then i upgraded my php from the centos repository to the yum repository created by jason litka available at http   www jasonlitka com yum repository   php 5 26  and performed a new install  problem disappeared  so there was a dependency during install that this system did not meet  important note  there were no error messages during installation when i first reported this issue 
theuros submitted  screenshoot     if you have time come to irc    i'll give you the access
because nobody sees it unless he starts to dig deeper  i mean that the db key for a context is "web" or "press" and not a number id  if my context got a named key at the beginning of a project like "download"  this key will stay the same and cannot be changed – the name can later be changed – like into "data"  there would be then a key "download" in the db for the context known as "data"  but one can solve this by duplicating the context and set a correct named key to "data"  first you would have to create a dummy context and drag all resources inside of it to not get them duplicated with the new context  so  renaming the visible name can be done now and to care about the internal db structure might be a little bit to much to worry about 
xod submitted  hi jason  installed a 2 1rc4 yesterday and it works flawless  could you reproduce it in rc3 or was it maybe just my installation  regards
rossco submitted  hi jason  the snippet is working now in the tv  i have not touched it  i did clear the cache via ftp when it was not working and signed in and out  uploaded and upgraded to rc4 3 times  i left the site for 2 days and came back  it's now working  i have no idea what was wrong but it's now working  i don't think a browser would have any effect on this but it's working  the only thing that i did do after a day of it not working is done a fresh install of rc4 rather then rc3 rc4 upgrade  perhaps some corruption in the files during upgrade  i do not have a copy of rc3 before the upgrade so on this occasion i cannot see if i can hit the issue again  hopefully this is just a corrupt upload file or something silly  thanks       copy of getforms snippet      the getform snippet gets the id and name of a form created in an external application that is on the same server  it's called machform and has it's own database  this is why i had to connect using the following   pre    php  dsn   'mysql host localhost dbname forms port 3306 charset utf 8'   xpdo   new xpdo  dsn 'usr' 'pw'      echo  o   xpdo  connect      'connected'   'not connected'   stmt    xpdo  query "select form_id form_name from ap_forms where form_active   1"   if   stmt    while   row    stmt  fetch pdo  fetch_assoc      children     array  'title'     row 'form_name'   'id'     row 'form_id'         resourceids   ""   i 0  foreach   children as  child    if  i  0    resourceids    "  "       resourceids     val   resourceids     child 'title'    resourceids    "  "   resourceids     child 'id'    i++    return  resourceids      pre 
johnywhy submitted  this is related to previously posted bug  http   bugs modx com issues 4786 i would say that if the admin cannot open the admin menus  that is a blocker 
you get a new session id  each time you login again  so  when you logout and login with another user or even with the same user at the same machine browser  you get a new session id  also when you login on different machines browsers at the same time  you get multiple session ids  i think  this would mean  each session id in the session table belongs to exactly one user

i've just built modx from the 3 x branch in github  which has a slightly different resource  elements and file tree  spacing in this area looks much tighter with more clarity and focus  i'm going to close this ticket for the time being 
ineffable submitted  sorry about this  the problem resolved by itself the next time i logged in  initially when i upgraded to rc 2 there was no menu bar on the left but now everything appears normal  thanks
it is the standard for atom feeds  but i hacked together this for now to avoid an extra snippet 
i was able to achieve the desired effect using permissions which in the end seems a much quicker and simpler solution than the manager customization route i was trying to explain above  let's close this one  sorry for any unintended confusion 
no  it make every word in the output lowercased  while  lcfirst  modifies only the first word  the solution is actually trivial   but i still think it should be included for symmetry with  ucfirst 
thanks for your interest    i thought it was clear but    visibly not    i give the procedure  create a snippet  create a resource  with the content to set  the observed and expected behaviour in each chapter    what would you need more  in my scenario  aph is not set      i have scenarios where input values may be missing  and sometime the behaviour becomes erratic with side effects    actually the one where the value is not set at all is disturbing     the one where i just add a " ' sign in the string and the result sounds weird    ps  there's no plugin  no other things  just a fresh install    perhaps i'm the only one who experiences it    
whitebyte  continuous tap is replacement of right click  at least that's in my case  android 5  
no it doesn't  it has a dash  like "blabla demo" but the error is the same as described in #12730  sorry  i didn't see this issue   but a fact is a fact  the download doesn't work  the latest version 2 5 0 pl also has this bug 
i think i have found the solution  i've experienced a number of issues since upgrading and i decided to delete the manager folder and upload a fresh one from the repo and re run setup  this appears to have fixed this issue and another one on my site  i checked my tables against bob's recommendations and all the ones he mentioned are present   http   bobsguides com blog html 2016 06 27 missing db fields  unknown column    url  i've not been able to check the site_content tables against a fresh install  but will try as a double check as soon as i can 
the rte package we're using is ckeditor  the editor_css_path system setting seemed to be working fine in modx 2 5 1 with this package  thanks for looking into this

hi jako  i did a few more test and it turns out that my host is running version 5 2 17 despite quoting that they are running version 5 4 24 in control panel
 opengeek  i'm using utf 8 charset  same db from one installation 
unfortunately i can’t understand the reason for the occurrence  but after the fix  the notifications disappeared
cleared the cache  did not help  checked on several devices the problem is actual  also now deployed pure modx 2 7 1 on modhost hosting  the same error is issued  os windows 10  firefox 67 0 2 64x
clearing cache does not help  one more hint i can give is that we produced this error in 2 sites  both of them are not placed at the httpdocs folder of  var www vhosts domain name  but in another folder one of them is an addon domain and the other is a subdomain  so the paths are   var www vhosts domain name addon domain  and  var www vhosts domain name sub domain name  i haven't try yet a fresh installation on the main domain path  var www vhosts domain name httpdocs i will do the check asap  thank you
yes  the commit hook solution is what i thought  but that's pretty techy for drive by contributors  i see long lines in all markdown cells of a v3 notebooks  in the 'source' field  is there something i should be doing differently except hitting the "save" button 
refreshing the page  so far  has fixed all the images  i notice that on some of my notebooks  with lots of images  some of the images will be fine at the start  while others will be the very small versions 
i'm able to reproduce this issue on a different pc running windows xp 32bit with pyqt 4 9 5 and ipython 0 13 2
mental blunder  i somehow related shift being prepended to all the shortcuts there 
i'm on osx 10 8 2 with either safari or chrome  i will try updating ipython to ensure that i have #2885
yep  missing    div    thanks and sorry 
note  edited this for errors running the commit above results in an empty browser screen upon opening the notebook  refresh does nothing  the following appear in the console 
might the result of  49  be considered a separate bug here 
i find it when i run the post install  i don't know where this function is  build_in or other package 
mm interesting  i've got osx 10 7 2  python 2 7 2  i just reinstalled my version of pyqt  which is 4 6 8 and compiled from source  without any errors  using homebrew  i don't think pyside is a requirement  but i've installed anyways  version 1 0 7   from source  using homebrew 
python version 2 7 on windows xp 32 bit the most repeatable way it happens is when first loading a notebook from the dashboard   like 5 seconds after i see the cells load i get the dead kernel message  if i x out the window choose nothing   i am not able to execute code  if i restart the kernel it works fine  and if i close the notebook and open it back up it does not happen again  yes  i am using pylab mode in general  but this happens without it enabled as well

sorry  was reviewing for a nasa panel  already the report of the bug was procrastination     
 fperez thx for your tip  what i want is just to import some modules  i had worked around it with script like the following  shell py  after run shell py  i can directly use xxx and yyy module 
without this patch  how should i get the   file   string   without renaming the file to  py  i don't see the harm with having   file   set  people often need to know the dynamic location of the file and its name in shell scripts  part of old  sh scripts that i would like to move to ipython   anyways ill just rename to  py
i can confirm that running  rst2html  on the generated rst file correctly shows the images  unfortunately incorporating the rst file into a sphinx document still does not correctly show the images  given that  rst2html  produces correct output  i assume that this would be a separate issue with sphinx 
32bit python 2 7 3 on windows xp pro sp3  x86 32bit 
i did python3 setup py build and python3 setup py install  i can't find an ipython3 script on the computer  i can find an ipython script and can get ipython to work with python 2 6 
confirmed on osx 
hmm  well  i thought it was trivial enough not to bother  but if that's how things are done here  i guess i should  not sure if there's a smart way to link to pull requests  but it's here  https   github com ipython ipython pull 2280  
that looks the same  thanks  subject  re   ipython  html notebook  backspace sometimes deletes multiple characters  #2417  and it should be related to #1464https   github com ipython ipython issues 1464 — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com ipython ipython issues 2417#issuecomment 8696905 
i am using www pyinstaller org for the freeze  the code in woo qt which causes the problem is
sorry  forgot to put the link to so in  i don't understand the question about pure python  the prompt rendering is from ipython  right 
yes it's a warning and not an error  but that warning is because the function is  cdef  and not  def   meaning it's not visible from python land and therefore is unused i guess  if it's not in python land  you have no way to call the function so it might as well have just failed to build  that would even be preferable to the runtime error you get 
at least i still can't complete  import mpl_  into  import mpl_toolkits  
it's in the first line 
this is on linux 
i thought it could work for consistency with other python objects  such as individual function and class definitions   but maybe this is indeed a bad  as in "confusing for the user"  idea  please feel free to close this issue if think the current behavior is right 
yes it does   i uploaded it as a gist   http   goo gl gw34kn
yep  shift + tab twice expands the tooltip and all the text is visible  the first shift tab yields the same result as above 
i don't know how activestate made its build attempt for 3 2  they built it successfully for 2 6 and 2 7  if the ipython developers have a fix  it would definitely help us activestate users 
thanks  it works ok with 0 12 1
 carreau do you mean there's a way to completely customize the "notebook serialization deserialization" process and to implement a brand new nbformat  without dealing with any   ipynb  file anymore

yes  that makes sense  so my own notebooks get automatically trusted by me  when will ipython 3 be released  i am interested in that since this release will also include better multi lang kernel support i assume

i know what causes it  a badly formed codemirror mode name  it was  java  rather than  text x java     i'll check to see what is causing this

pandoc is in   library haskell bin   you mentioned my path should be in  bashrc  it is in my  bash_profile  i doubt that should make a difference  which i verified doesn't

prototype js doesnot have a no conflict mode as of now   also with the new functionality of flexibility to add external javascripts in ipython2  it might get problems in future  since many javascript libraries use     for their selectors or for other purposes   and this will affect adding embedding   many other javascript libraries not only prototype js  
not too much of a surprise 
uhh i don't think i can    seems to occur quite rarely and randomly    anyway  if others are experiencing the same issue  then they will probably report about it here
deleting the history was not effective  my current ipython2 version is 2 1 0  the problem is on ipython2  because ipython3 is working perfectly fine

this is how you can reproduce this big problem  1  create ipynb  some content  save and close  2  change the file access to read only flag  3  open the notebook and add some extra content  at this point the extra content     cannot be saved in existing file  even if read only flag is removed while notebook is open     cannot be transferred to a new notebook  make a copy option in file menu     cannot be downloaded from file menu option  so the extra content is lost  on thu  apr 23  2015 at 11 25 pm  koenvb notifications github com wrote 
conda  h works in  powershell  cmd  ipython terminal  ipython qtconsole  in ipython notebook one time it is stuck  the other time it shows very weird old command  c  users    documents python scripts conda install sqlalchemy   force 1  conda install the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process  which i can kill manually  please note that this is python 3  one another machine with python 2  the conda  h works in notebook as well 
ok i will make a pr on https   github com ipython ipython website  however the same instruction is in the docs sections of this repository
it's fine in the notebook  but fails in nbconvert 
conda list says qtconsole 4 0 1 but  as i said  the issue is old for me  years  it happened in osx also  but i don't remember the frequency  today was the last drop  i had to create an issue
i've looked at the other discussions and some are quite similar  what i've seen is  that  on some of the discussions the pythonpath variable was mentioned to have something to do with it  i can definitly say that this is not the case because the  ''  entry in sys path 0  is not dependent on the pythonpath setting  i can see two possible workarounds  1  early in the startingprocess you check if sys path 0      ''  and pop this entry from the list  later on  when the kernel is loaded you add this entry back to sys path  at the beginning of the list   2  early in the startingprocess you store the cwd and change to a predefined directory  i e     ipython locate    and restore the cwd after the kernel is loaded   unfortunately i'm not as familiar with the source code as to determine the positions in the code where these workearounds could be applied  i think the second workaround would be easier to implement  because the kernel code is already separated from the frontend code  because of this seperation there is no reason why the kernel should start from the current directory  you could easily envoke a  cd startdirectory  throu via zmq after the start of the kernel 
now i tried   none of them worked  but they all outputted  "ipython will make a temporary file named  'path filename py'" 
just checked  and indeed you are correct  it's actually just qt 
pandas 0 15 1  i believe the is a "new" feature of the combination of ipython 2 3 pandas 0 15 and did not occur in with ipython 2 2 pandas 0 14   i have the exact same command with the same data in a notebook that rendered correctly with the older combination 
sorry  i did not put in the os x 10 8 5 and 10 9 however  earlier this week  i upgraded pyqt to 4 11 3 and sip 4 16 5  and python 2 7 9  and now it works  at least with os x 10 8 5  tomorrow  i will confirm the same with 10 9  if it does work with the above python pyqt4 versions  i'll close this out

hi  carreau thanks for reply  how should i set any _readline_ configuration  i'm using debian bash terminal
 assuming cwd   current working directory   it's a folder full of ipynb's and their corresponding  py exports  here's the  gist  https   gist github com bmcfee 4dcf902785e4c754e901   should i be looking for something specific 
turns out it wasn't a dumb question  i tried getting ipython notebook running the same way i do without a virtualenv  i try to run notebook continously and install the package it fails importing until it runs  i got confused because it failed on a pyzmq import but i had installed it on virtualenv  to fix it i also installed ipython from package repo  there still might be bug because maybe it uses the system version when it should use virtualenv one  pyzmq imports just fine 
i am using ipython 3 0 and putting the css in the same folder worked  interestingly  using the drop down menu and 'download as html' does not  i'll stick with the commandline for generating the html documents  thanks 
hi minrk  thanks for a reply  here is an output   it looks like everything is ok with tornado and zmq 
ls  l says " drwx      + 14 myname staff 476 may 11 07 53 desktop " etc "download as   " works okay and puts a file in my downloads  when i click the floppy disk symbol nothing happens and there are no messages in terminal
i was working on a notebook and needed to debug so i ran  ipython console   existing kernel ad2bfcc4 5246 43f7 9ddf 3189506b23d8 json   then i tried  quit keep_kernel true   from the console ipython and the notebook kernel got restarted  everytime  
i haven't tried too much to figure what exactly is the reason but it happened to me in the past as well few times and the above fix let me continue working  whenever i update to a new release i encounter this behavior so it might be a good idea to make that code part immune to this possibility even if i can't pinpoint the exact reason  agreed

it actually returns nothings  it seems that it might be related to  issue described here about el capitan  http   www tug org mactex mactex download html   on a different note  i may have to create another issue for this or it may have been solved  but i noticed that calling  ipython notebook  with    profile  and    color  no longer works  would you happen to know if there is a solution    edit    i just fixed the paths and added the  pdflatex  path to  bashrc   now for  which pdflatex  i get   library tex texbin pdflatex  but i still get that  pdflatex not found on path

oh  sorry i forgot to mention   i am using the os x backend  as defined in my matplotlibrc file  so that it is selected automatically when calling "ipython   pylab"   i also tried starting with "ipython" and then doing " matplotlib osx" but i get the same behavior 
hi   takluyver this is the output when i typed   pylab 
thanks for the speedy response  takluyver  the user has cleared some space from his home directory  it also appears that it was affected by a compiler failure issue  when the python program failed to compile  the system kept all the failure logs and did not delete the temporary files generated during the compilation in the root directory     theano   after deleting this folder  the issue was resolved  thanks again 
i don't know how to try with another version  i am just doing a self update of mac port from times to times  but i am not an expert on installation  many thanks for your active response 
running the suggested command  i got this  to install the kernel  the commands i used are 
yes  that appears to work  though that function takes a lot of extra arguments that i don't know what mean

 wiggin15 i am using colorama 0 3 9   this works fine  it even works if i run it within ipython shell  the problem seems exclusive to having colorama init   called before embedding an ipython shell  then an ipython shell is embedded  and then ctrl d within the embedded shell is handled by ipython which somehow causes a problem

i just tried reverting back to 7 11 1 and the issue is still there  so  i think that the connection to the ipython update is coincidental  fwiw  this is also happening with jupyter console  although the output is slightly different than above when repeatedly typing '1+2'   i downgraded jupyter_console from 61 0 to 6 0 0 which also downgraded prompt_toolkit from 3 0 to 2 0 9  after this downgrade  the issue is gone  although the repl seems slow  but  it works  i then upgraded to ipython 7 12 0 and it works too  so the issue is coming from the jupyter_console 6 1 0 update rather than the ipython update  i'll close this issue and move my question to the jupyter_console github site

yes  i would expect no messages  they make it harder to find the error and  depending on the terminal size  completely hide the traceback 
i suppose it isn't possible to specify data by kwarg so that it won't be interpreted as something else  in any case  it might be better to deprecate and eventually move on rather than keep it forever 
no
that might be hard  the error is rare and our config is large  our inputs are   i wonder if the zeromq is handling the codec and charset correctly   we've certainly had assorted problems with zeromq input in the past and are in the process of removing it   also we're on logstash 1 4 1 not 1 4 2 as i reported earlier   though i don't see anything obviously relevant in the change notes   i can give you another interesting data point  the exception  and thus the hang  appears to be avoided by running logstash with two  v flags  more verbose   back story  when i first encountered this some months ago i started running  logstash  v  v  to try to identify the problem message  and thus the input and likely flow through the filters   but when i run logstash  v  v the problem doesn't appear  logstash is handling about 7 million messages per day  it's been running for weeks without a problem  today i deployed an update and forgot to make the manual change to run with  v  v so it ran with just  v  within a couple of hours it had hung  i've reenabled  v  v and it's been running fine for several hours now

well i suppose on second read i didn't exactly follow the instructions here http   logstash net docs 1 4 2 tutorials getting started with logstash  instead of using elasticsearch 1 1 i'm using 1 3 2 so perhaps that's the issue  my logstash conf file is a cut paste of logstash syslog conf in the link above and my elasticsearch conf is whatever the default that comes when you first download it  i probably won't downgrade my elasticsearch as i'm using it for other projects  so just feel free to close the issue

certainly true for quick and dirty poc  but for running software in production on highly important data it's always good to have some degree of quality assurance  debian have reputation for precisely that  running stuff from third party repo   doesn't  and for a good reason  for instance right now lintian gives 15326  sic   errors upon package inspection  each of those potentially a maintenance problem or worse   loss of data  fixing those is a boring job but it's the boring job which makes software maintainable and predictable  few quick examples  ruby script but no ruby dep error on each ruby file  package should have explicit dependency on ruby version so it's taken into account when ruby is updated  wrong path for interpreter on opt logstash vendor bundle jruby 2 1 gems diff lcs 1 2 5 bin ldiff  # ruby     usr bin ruby    the path to ruby interpreter is hardcoded and it's wrong non standard dir perm on var lib logstash    potential security risk dir or file in opt   that's obvious etc

after further investigation i think i better understand the nature of the problem  i don't think it's a bug  per se  just a capacity issue  i tried creating a dummy file with one 500k line  and that didn't cause any trouble  however  when i looked at the original file  i saw that there were several lines of 300k or more  i only noticed the one at the end of the file initially   also  the timeout i have on logstash forwarder is only 15 seconds  it looks like this is what's going on  1  logstash forwarder  lsf  connects to logstash  ls  and starts shipping several ridiculously long lines 2  ls starts processing the shipped lines 3  lsf waits for its timeout and does not receive an ack  so it closes the connection and tries again 4  lsf connects to ls and starts shipping several ridiculously long lines 5  ls is still processing the previous lines  so it sets up a new thread to deal with the new connection from lsf 6  lsf waits for its timeout and does not receive an ack  so it tries again 7  goto 4 when i increased the timeout on logstash forwarder to 300 seconds  logstash was able to respond in time  it took about 28 seconds   logstash forwarder received the ack and registered those lines as processed  and the logstash service did not fall over  i'm not sure that there's anything to be done about this case  other than advocating longer timeouts in logstash forwarder configs  it might be possible to set a threshold for the number of connections logstash is willing to accept from the same host  so that in this case logstash would burn three  or however many  threads on this one machine but not keep spawning new threads and being unable to service other machines' connection requests  alternatively  it looks like logstash forwarder attempts to queue up 1024 lines for shipping at a time  perhaps it could look at the size of the batch  and queue up either 1024 lines or 500k of data  or whatever   whichever comes first  so as to avoid trying to send a small number of ridiculously long lines that will not be able to be processed in the timeout allotted  for my case  i deleted the offending lines from the log file and gently suggested to the program's owner that he truncate log lines at a reasonable length  there's nothing more i need from you guys  so you can close this on my account

hi  elvarb  the plugin does support authentication  you can use the http basic auth url format  e g   http   user pass example com   or you can pass an authorization header with a base64 encoded password  you might also consider looking at the new  logstash input http_poller  https   github com logstash plugins logstash input http_poller  plugin and its integrated interval function 
i did not know they dropped support for java 1 6  it is never mentioned in the changelogs or blog posts  i'm kind of stuck with java 1 6 for now since our machines still run this version  i will have to wait with the migration or install a seperate jre for logstash  wich is not preffered by our ops engineers   update  just tested it with java oracle 1 7 and it gives the same exception  is there anybody that got the xml filter working on logstash 1 5 1 
on ubuntu 15 04  first host was installed manually  next 6 hosts installed via ansible tasks  below   all exhibited same issues 
 andrewvc  ah nice  didn't know there was a  node name  available  in my opinion including both  hostname  and  node name  would even be more unique to identify an instance  i also think it is important to have this identical across all api responses 
sounds good  and the monitoring ui benefits brief will just be in that top level page then  right  in this particular context  i'd be +1 for including a snapshot of the ui

it's just a shell script that accepts the product  alertkey  alertmessage  alertseverity  and timestamp values as arguments  i literally changed the script at one point to just echo hello world to a file to determine if it was even getting executed  the results show that with no space between the tick and the quote that the indicated error is thrown without the script ever actually executing  so    what is failing is the call from logstash to the shell script while it is still on the logstash side  my hypothesis is that there is a bug such that the final tick is getting eaten and that by putting a space between the tick and the quote the space gets eaten instead preserving the integrity of the command 
i am using logstash 1 5 4  sorry for not mentioning that at the beginning  unfortunately this issue is still present 
short answer  because i can   smiley  long answer  i found out about this bug while working on https   github com logstash plugins logstash codec cef pull 14  the cef specification allows to send a _devicecustomdate1_ field and a first "naive" approach of mine was to rename the   timestamp  field  this was obviously a bad idea  still i was surprised to see logstash crashing with this valid configuration  i consider this a bug  if   timestamp  is a required field  may be even some kind of protected field   operations  which remove the required protected fields  should be prevented  rename  remove   this may be exploited by some kind of "log injection attack"  if _sprintf_ is in use  example  the cef specification  https   protect724 hp com servlet jiveservlet downloadbody 1072 102 6 4697 commoneventformat pdf  defines fields like  cs1label   which is the label for the  cs1   custom field 1 of type string   in this case it would be possible to have a config like   would crash logstash  i am aware of the fact that this a kind is a crafted example  but still it is valid according to the spec of cef and we should try to make logstash as stable and invulnerable as possible

i was able to resolve the issue  previously  logstash_jdbc_last_run file was not getting created  but by putting option clean_run  true it started working 
yes i do have data for the 31  all my data are pushed into a json  this json is always updated  if you tail it  you'll be able to see the change  it's on real time so of course i have data for 31 and 01 04 then with logstash i have  as you can see i pushed into 2 elasticsearch cluster for testing purposes  10 107 created my indices but 10 1 did not created index for neither 31 or today 01 04  not sure what kind of other configuration you may need 
 jordansissel i have never had to use export or set  a in  etc default   or  etc sysconfig   for any other program  using fedora and systemd  logstash 5 1 1 is able to read the variable without any modifications  just using tcp_port 123  this is the standard way to define variables in these files  i also don't think this was the case with prior versions of logstash when logstash used sysv init script  so this is something that's not right with the upstart script  i don't know if set  a is the solution but it was the simplest way to export the variables without knowing the names  you can define the variable in the upstart script by doing "env tcp_port 123"  but the concern is if this file gets replaced during an upgrade  a couple of alternatives are  1  use export   cat  etc default logstash   xargs  to load the file in the variables vs "   etc default logstash"  2  eval   cat  etc default logstash   sed 's   export  '  see these links  http   stackoverflow com questions 20150168 source a file in upstart conf file http   askubuntu com questions 711946 how to load environment variable from a file for an upstart job http   serverfault com questions 128605 have upstart read environment from etc environment for a service so i am basically asking that the upstart script export the variables in  etc default logstash and  etc sysconfig logstash to make it consistent with other applications  like elasticsearch  and prior versions of logstash 
i'm not seeing this issue anymore 
hi thomas  thank you for your help  after i've appended a newline to the end of the file  logstash started to function normally  thank you again  best regards  hao wang     from  thomas bray notifications github com sent  wednesday  august 24  2016 4 06 05 am to  elastic logstash cc  haow85  author subject  re   elastic logstash  logstash produces no output when input is a simple text file  #5817  i was thinking more of setting it to "0"   but that would also have worked  couple of things i can thing of is there a newline after hello world  might be still waiting for event 2  can the user read write the files ## you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on githubhttps   github com elastic logstash issues 5817#issuecomment 242001704  or mute the threadhttps   github com notifications unsubscribe auth auaz2kmv17wbsrlqzrnu8jvdr8tne3npks5qjal9gajpzm4jrswk 
in the end  i uninstalled and re installed logstash  using the same config files  there is now no problem  i don't understand why it broke though 
well up until two three weeks ago we were running a different pipeline and with an older version of logstash  cant remember which but at least a year old  which worked well for over a year  a few weeks ago we migrated to kafka in production and were forced to upgrade logstash along with it  as of last friday it has been crashing at least twice per day after having run fine for about two weeks prior  we think it could be "work load" related but as you see its not going to be easy with zero information in the logs or anywhere else  at this point we have no idea if its the input plugin or output plugin or other  we are currently running with a consumer_count of 1 on the kafka  input  side 
thanks jake  i didn’t know how to move it so i created a new ticket  https   github com logstash plugins logstash input tcp issues 77  https   github com logstash plugins logstash input tcp issues 77  and pasted description from the original  hope that’s ok  john
after upgrading to logstash 6 2 3  i don’t see the issue anymore thanks regards  bhanu
hi  andrewvc   thanks for helping out  regarding sharing of docker image please give me some time  apart from this if you need any other information   i installed jruby manually  then set use_ruby 1  this did not produce segmentation fault  but got failed to identify bundle gem location and always picking up path within logstash installation  the docker image is built on oracle linux 7 
nat64 would translate cleanly but if you take a look at artifacts elastic co you will see   but_  usr share logstash bin logstash plugin install logstash codec sflow leads to  error  something went wrong when installing logstash codec sflow  message  network is unreachable   failed to open tcp connection to artifacts elastic co 443  network is unreachable   no message available  seems something with ipv6 is not working     
 guyboertje   yes i have more than 4095 discoverable files as i have 5k servers which are throwing syslogs and logstash processing them so each time if there is log update on the syslog file then it will process them all   where as i have another logs rmlogs which again having some file may be 100 or 10000 based on that 
indeed  didn't see this setting  thanks a lot  kares

this is on ubuntu 11 10 gnome shell
this is what i had to do in the end  it was the only thing that worked  after the block chain has downloaded things are now working again 
i fixed it  i rebuilt it with 64 bit enabled
i can't test it on multiple windows builds  but since it works for me i'd say yes  i'm a git beginner  so please submit it for me  thanks 
i am on the mac osx 10 7 2 lion the passphrase seem to work if i create a new bitcoin folder in version 0 4 0 5 problem is the original dat file was created since early client 0 3 durning one of the migration to each version i was having a bug when i get a new transaction  the client would automatically generate a new bitcoin address by it's own  i believe it was client 0 4 before i input passphrase   this was fixed after i input passphrase  i still have the files from 0 4 after i input the passphrase  this seems to be the point where everything started  i get the exception error still when i load up the files 
as i said  i think the ui is misdesigned  all i'm saying is  there is a button  but nothing happens when clicking on it  if you cannot handle the button  remove it

no  the memory usage is low  it does use a lot of cpu though   about 50  cpu usage according to top  it depends  sometimes it last a few seconds  sometimes it lasts tens of seconds  it's not due to a new block  i just tested it and it froze several times before a new block was found 
oh huh  the ones that work are ntfs  the one that doesn't work is exfat   i guess that's too much of a coincidence to discount  i would expect  tho  that filesystems are abstracted by the os so the program doesn't have to care about it  no

 theuni yes  this patch solved the problem  thanks 
could be that i don't     which package exactly  "libboost1 42 all dev" 
they are more explicit  but require retyping every time  i imagine the explicit argument would override the environment variable  that is a fair point  i personally would have liked something like that a couple of times in shell sessions  that's why i decided to bring up the idea  honestly  though  i could probably just as well have used a bash  alias  instead of an environment variable in those situations  so i don't have a strong opinion here  either 
restarted  and it synced up right away 
the expected behavior is that when listen 0 is set  the node doesn't relay blocks and hence uses minimal bandwidth  this is documented in many places  including https   bitcoin org en full node#disable listening  i see now that maxuploadtarget 0 means unlimited bandwidth  when i added it to my conf that setting wasn't documented  so i'm now removing it  but listen 0 should have still overridden that 
the test passes on v0 16 3  and fails identically as above on master  but it turns out this test is not present in 0 16 3 anyway 
i have got the following   bitcoind  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12157216 7379480 236d5fda eded 11e4 8b31 9f85c654655e png  in russian windows 7 x64 generally i do see russian letters in console but these printed out by bitcoind are unreadable 
thank you for you are interested in the case  yes  you are right   it could be a reason of a change address  what can i do   my wallet seems different summary amount of btc than a summary of my existing addresses from blockchain  i'm interested is this one of described situations in http   bitzuma com posts five ways to lose money with bitcoin change addresses   i have a backup from of the wallet from yesterday  how do you think   what i should do   i turned off the wallet after first confirmation

sure 
not being set in bitcoin conf  contents of bitcoin conf 
yes  i can confirm that giving the flags to '  configure' works as expected  giving them to 'make' only trips up at the leveldb part as described 
none  just a wrong message  could also be ignored 
a 15 btc fee for under 7 btc in outputs   my guess is whoever it was is using a client that does not auto adjust fees and wanted to make sure the transaction got past the spam attack and meant 15 mbtc or something similar  given that no pool has 50  of the network it does not seem rational or likely that the person making the transaction had a high probability of being the miner to retrieve it  the most logical explanation is a mistake  safety against those kind of mistakes can help grow confidence in the general population that often is afraid of making those kind of mistakes because computers to them are hard 
previous version was 0 17 1  the addresses could be from as far back as 0 16 0 though based on the dates we have for them 
jonasschnelli  when typing  xcode select  p   i receive the following output   i wasn't sure what you were looking for  so i include the following in anticipation of your needs   xcode select  version    xcode select  version 895       laanwj  thank you for the background  i do understand how this could be a challenge for the team  and i certainly am not trying to create work  unfortunately  at this time  i am pretty locked into snow leopard  i hope to be able to move forward  perhaps through the use of virtual machines   at some point during the next 12 months  but i would need a working installation of bitcoin core long before then  for me  it isn't a matter of just dragging my feet or not wanting to upgrade  i'd prefer to be on el cap  if for no other reason than security patches  i just have to be patient for the time being  you asked if i can "compile other c c++ code "  to which i say  "i'm not sure"  i haven't had need to do so recently  does anyone have a recommendation as to a simple build i could try to test this  my only requirements are    1  needs to be a trusted code base    i can not afford to add any security vulnerabilities  and 2  needs to be easy to build    i'm not afraid of the cli  but i don't live there  i can follow a well written "how to" but following instructions and understanding what one is doing are two completely different things  thank you  mr  van der laan     paveljanik  hopefully the below file is what you are looking for     config log txt  https   github com bitcoin bitcoin files 224390 config log txt      i appreciate the work that you all do for the community  as before  please let me know if there is more that i can do to help    regards

yes  i'm on windows though  i tried it both with command line and powershell and both of them are cutting it   0xb10c after reading  laanwj's reply i think answers for your questions are irrelevant  if you think it's still helpful  i can dig it up and give you exact numbers  overall  it's a bit annoying  but oh well  if nobody feels like fixing it  it's not the end of the world  in that case just let the robot to autoclose the issue after it gets too old 
thank you  i could install well  i was referring the book from 2014  dec  this causes me a problem 
 ken2812221 hi  thanks for the quick response  sure  i'm going to try that now  will let you know 
yes problem exist in bitcoin core   bitcoin core 0 13 1   01  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 13068514 21595296 092bad50 d15f 11e6 96bc c289a9654b64 jpg 
hi    so i just let the "done loading" screen sit there all night and it looks like the entire system behaved as it should have    loading blocks and catching up the chain  here is a gist of the entire debug log  thebluematt https   gist github com sheldonth 2ba09ba625375bee7f2f64957ca4fe10 i have yet to be able to get the qt ui to appear  i am using 0 14    one factor to note is that my bitcoin data directory is on an external drive which also had time machine backups start on it  automatically  while bitcoin was trying to open  i realized this morning that i was simultaneously time machine'ing a backup onto the same drive that bitcoin was working off of  i wonder if that could've casued the locks referred to above  since i can currently reproduce the problem i will try starting bitcoin with the  debug flag and sending any other logs over 
 laanwj everything is ok  i want to analysis some data from the blockchain  so i need the block index file  but i can not find the blkindex dat 
where would i find the debug log  and yes

there is definitely no typo or wrong network issue  i'm copy pasting it from electrum  i have created and use this bech32 address in electrum  mainnet   i tried with bitcoin core 0 16 0rc2 and it fails there too  didn't try with earlier versions because it is my understanding that 0 16 is the first version supporting bech32 
my  bat files was  bitcoin cli stop  bitcoin cli getbalance and etc  and it worked on official version  i tried now your lines  but i get the same errors  i tried to compile 0 16 1 with the same libs on mingw w64 and i get a similar error  
i just checked and yes  autoconf v2 69
boost 1 66 0
actually i'm creating new genesis block with ntime and nnonce  i changed the cscript and psztimestamp  if anyone can guide me how can i create my own genesis block that will really helpful for me 
yes  in fact  i am unable to start the application without the crash 
i must have made a mistake with my git checkouts  master outputs to stdout by default  0 16 1 doesn't  thanks 
i used the old 0 9 version of bitcoin   i am able to run  make  once i switch to v0 16 0  thank you

sorry  fixed 
i don't know what that means  i ll look it up 
i couldn't find a hint in the bisq documentation that bip37 is mandatory  i tried now whitelisting my client network 192 168 1 0 24  where also my bitcoin node is running   it works with  whitelist bloomfilter 192 168 1 0 24
oh    looks like that was the problem  but now a new problem appeared

now i use  string  companies id  i would like replace with  getprimarykey  of  companies  table
q   what does the create table statement for that table look like  a    q   what is the specific command you are using to run bake  a     image  https   f cloud github com assets 1989395 1366037 c4d3e5ca 38a8 11e3 84ac d5ff338c70fb png    image  https   f cloud github com assets 1989395 1366038 e6d59f7e 38a8 11e3 968b 8bc5038636d7 png 
is it possible they always did   due to some hardcoded      it is just not noticeable on non win  see the last vendors ones  i will try to look into it some more  only scratched the surface for now 
as mentioned above that was the 2 x way of defining the key as not  ''  but  '0'   but if that is now a limitation that is on purpose  i am fine with always sticking to  ''  
sounds like this would be a similar issue like enum support for mysql  what alternatives can the documentation point out to use 
 renan don't we have that constraint with other classes as well  whats a solution 
when catching the exception and relying on the results of params  you need to know the total number of pages sometimes  there is a 2nd issue here  the count query not run  but thats a different issue  it was just topic in the channel earlier 
no  those were unrelated  i could not figure out how to solve the static inception issue yet 
a plugin controller extending the appcontroller  i had to guard it with has   check to prevent it being loaded twice with different config   https   github com dereuromark cakephp queue blob master src controller admin queuedjobscontroller php#l34    the different config then blows up here if the one in appcontroller has been loaded differently 
sort with deprecxstion would probably be preferred  but otherwise the exeption instead of silent no op maybe 
i downloaded it from the main page of http   cakephp org    https   github com cakephp cakephp zipball 2 4 2
 this  model  create     this  model  save array  'phone'  'xxxxxxxxxx'    
 josegonzalez i got my "answer" from  markstory  and then i would believe it's up to you guys on whether or not this is a wanted behavior 
thanks  markstory   that did the trick  i just added a new pr for the docs to clarify this as this doesn't seem to be documented yet 
 josegonzalez here it is 
cakephp 3 0 dev 2   i miss you tell me the version
sorry mark  i'm not familiar with events in cake  i'm coming from 1 3    i do like the observer pattern in general though  and i just checked the  events system page  http   book cakephp org 2 0 en core libraries events html   i think that would work  i didn't see any events being triggered in the rest of the authentication code base though  2 5 5   but i can try to write a pr that uses  cakeevent  
sorry  checked cake error log  was empty  but didn't check the webserver's log  it says   seems like i used a wrong namespace in authhelper  namespace cake view helper instead of namespace app view helper   doh  sorry  you can close this ticket 
kindly check the below output for  var_dump  post  created    object cake i18n frozentime #187  3     "date"    string 26  "2015 12 23 09 48 36 000000"  "timezone_type"    int 3   "timezone"    string 3  "utc"   
yes management of components helpers across all controllers  management of behaviors across all tables entities  etc  i do also like a consistent interface on how to load manage "modules" for mvc  conventions and consistency help lots i think  over configuration and special cases 
it is entirely possible i've messed something up somewhere  but i'm not seeing it  version of cakephp from composer json 
hi mark many thanks for reply  application php     changed _    add new routingmiddleware  this  '_cake_routes_'     _ too _    add new routingmiddleware  this     _ ### resolved order routes are now visible 
cakephp 3 0  but i know about differences between o s  infact the viewclass works without problems  i take only 6 failures on test  but cake works duly   +1 
i would just add the new one  the existing path is 100  necessary for global overrides  the new one just grants you the ability to override app views without effecting other plugins 
white space is not the problem here

role is irrelevant   it's just an attribute manually added  in this case for twitter bootstrap  i have only included relevant code that directly affects the issue  it can be ignored  when i specified an id  i set it as an html attribute   added to submission above
no  there is no problem with the display css and js  only problem is access plugin without slashes in url

'storedhash' is a placeholder  for demonstration purposes i created a user with the password 'testtest' while registering  using the blowfishpasswordhasher  hash   it produces the hash  inside of blowfishpasswordhasher  check    which of course does not pass the test against the stored hash

 ionas  this  save   will fail  and return false triggering the transaction to rollback  this should be correct behavior 
 markstory right now  i could see the duration in milliseconds as being useful  for example  i have a web page that has to find records using a very large  in  operator  the performance is relative to the database size  overtime the server grows the database to where i might want to start caching query results based upon the duration of the query  things like that  i could easily wrap everything in a timer  but i thought why not make this a standard feature

it should generate a set of hidden fields with a attribute name an indexed array with the name of field  example    input type "hidden" name "fieldname index " value "my value"   so we can pass the previous value again  best regards 
generates the same sql error 
ah yeah makes sense  i missed the part about those methods going away for rc 
yeah that would be fine  i thought about doing that actually but i wasn't sure if something more explicit like finderoptions would be better 
sorry with thanksgiving i was afk  the association does do a left join for the association  but the associated table has a finder which puts an inner join for i18n  so this is happening   even if you specify subquery    select  it will error out  which is odd since i think that's the default  i thought this was also by design  but it works when you don't specify the strategy but doesn't work when you do   which makes it seem like something's wrong 
in 3 1 2   using subquery 
 markstory i honestly don't have any idea  because such concept as nested validation of fields if one of them is empty  is not present  i'd probably do some custom validation of fields in controller  because of ui logic and maybe through methods added to corresponding entity  and then part of the validation would be model required format of fields with allowempty rule in my opinion the way of validation in orm backed model and model less form is nearly identical  with exception  that correct validation is not confirmed then by successfull save edit delete orm operation
well  i think midnight would be the right thing to do  i think any date to datetime conversion would do that  i have not tested to say and please correct me if i'm thinking wrong but i'm also afraid this can possibly impact in comparison  in my head is like having 1  making it 1 4    1 5    to echo floor 1 9999  in the end  and you need to call floor or you won't have 1  also i thought it was very bad because i baked controller model view for my user and my userscontroller index was showing something like '2014 06 06 12 05am' and you refresh the page    you have '2014 06 06 12 06am'  the first thing that came to my head was 'why is my data updating itself if i'm not doing anything '  i think the default output for a date type should be '2014 06 06'  but if not possible  in the worst case '2014 06 06 00 00am'   even if this is date    and time  but at least they should be representations for the same timestamp  iterate time as day goes on makes data inconsistent and unreliable  please correct me if i'm wrong  i don't have as many experience as you guys do but this is what i think 
 navigationmenuses 
now that you put it that way  i think you're right  to be honest with you i think it's just laziness on my part  i like how entities have those callbacks for setting getting variables which lets me keep it nice and organized  i think i opened this issue in haste without thinking it through  sorry about that 
i'd be happy to patch this  it's just a single check to see if the binding key has been set  when i put this issue in yesterday i just didn't have time to take care of it  i'll put in a pr in a moment 
i don't want to show the same error twice so much as i want to apply an error message to all of the fields it applies to without duplicate code  the fields i am trying to do this with are kind of an  xor  situation to avoid creating two separate tables  and additional code to support that   i suppose it could be argued that something like this is more what was intended 
this is the controller action 
i did not upgrade to any version  this was a fresh install that was working and then suddenly started throwing the error on a page refresh  the confusing thing is that i have not touched a single line of php yet 
in the first paragraph you can find the following sentence  by default cakephp protects against mass assignment and makes you whitelist which fields are mass assignable  i assume it means that the default value of  _accessible is    see entitytrait 
i have a boolean database column which stores the value in a hidden field  when the value is true then 'value "1"' but when value is false then nothing will be added as attribute 
i guess what i'm saying is this logic makes sense to  a  require all 4 parameters  throw exception      if one is missing or b  try to handle cases where a parameter is missing correctly  for instance  maybe the default settings should be  it just seems kind of odd that there isn't better checking here 
 xety we can use  this  product but it's not clear and not nice we should use alias  prefix so that it's clear and nice example   this  modela  modelb  modelc  savefield 'status'  true   it's nice than if we use  this  modela  modelb  modelc  savefield 'modelc status'  true  
ok i understand  so if i want to keep my layout the default        this  fetch 'title'          then i should add this above the fetch statement to make it work 
hi  markstory well i am saving information from a 3rd webservice  and because of the data nature  i already have primarykeys  because it is a lot of data i do not wish to create a redundant autonumeric primarykey having a 100  unique field returned by the webservice  id   i was preparing the entities from and array and  newentity   method  do i have to use  patchentity     data 
any  phpunit xml  file from the plugins listed above could be an example  that's why i'm getting crazy because i know these tests should work but they don't  xd here's the process i try to do  click on the image to see the recording      asciicast  https   asciinema org a 0m6dgbjl7vd4m7tuw46cklm6v png   https   asciinema org a 0m6dgbjl7vd4m7tuw46cklm6v  i'm pretty sure i'm doing something wrong but i did this a lot of times before without any problem until now    cry 
sorry for the delay  here was very late when i saw your comments  answering  admad  i'm using a x64 ubuntu  16 04   but how could that affect  i've created an entire app to reproduce this and i've ensured that this only occurs with sqlite  well  i've not tested postgreesql  but with mysql works as expected    sqlite issue zip  https   github com cakephp cakephp files 274351 sqlite issue zip  the zip file only has the required files to reproduce the issue    config app default php  configured test db to work with sqlite using   memory   as db    src model entity stat php   src model table statstable php   tests testcase model table statstabletest php   tests fixture statsfixture php phpunit output

sorry    i make you lose your time  cakephp is well oiled  it's me i'm tired  it's javascript in the browser which changed the value of the input       1      door  i want to send you my best feelings about cake3  it's great  well done  keep it up 
sure  but i'd like to put the directory with all the compiled asset into   gitignore  to not have redundant file to commit  like this    webroot plugins    futhermore i have a lot of theme and having a subdirectory helps me to keep my webroot folder tidier 
it was an issue with my code  another tree behavior was included to extend the cake treebehavior  and the issue seems to be resolved by placing 'level'    null in the protected  _defaultconfig variables of the extended class 
yes i have modified the default template  but same when i disable my config  the error doesn't appear 
i found the cause now  it was a problem with my   htaccess  file  it was  rewriterule        index php  1  qsa l   instead of  rewriterule        index php  l    no glue where this line came from  in all cakephp release versions i checked  there was the correct line  this seems not to be an issue  any more    and can be removed 
_sorry  my english is not good _ i run the sql generated by cakephp in   "sqlserver management studio" and it works perfect  retrieves data from the db    so i rule out that the generated sql are wrong  the problem has to be when you retrieve that information  but the problem seems this when the   orm  cakephp or pdo   has to retrieve the information  does not deliver any results  therefore gives   false  empty array  the counter gives "0"   results  look at the debug out 
i did not  thank you 
 dakota before reporting  i've searched for a more recent one but could not find any  64 bit ones  
first via an custom config file  than direct in the formhelper  see here 
 markstory there is a  datetype  object that is meant to format date fields in from the database  which it does not do correctly  as it adds a time  problem is that i do want the date fields to be formated as a date only  because the time of 00 00 is just meaningless on those  as far as i have come on the codebase  it is not possible to change that applicationwide  or set it as an applicationwide default in the core   removing the  datetype  database type would be fair  as everybody would know that this has not been taken care of    my other solution is shown below   admad this is not possible in a generic way  or i am not getting it  i want this date format to be applicationwide and beeing able to set it like the timeformat with  time  settostringformat    and  time   niceformat   even localized of course  this is not possible at the moment  as chaingeing it there would cause it beeing changed for all  datetimetype  instances too  am i still missing something  my suggestion to fix this would be  adding  src cake i18n date php    this alone will format all date database fields as only date  application wide  including localization and allows this format to be changed by setting  date  settostringformat    and  date   niceformat   like the default datetime formats too  if that same behaviour can be achieved easier  i am listening 
digging into the source  it seems that in  https   github com cakephp cakephp blob master src database schema sqliteschema php the  _convertcolumn  function refers to column types that do not exist in sqlite   https   www sqlite org datatype3 html  
ok    https   gist github com andrecavallari a80e56a745ec52f2a24c as simple as that   
 markstory it works  this is the custom find  in this case  if needed  how can i specify particular    where    for a table  i mean  now i am using  users ads payments  if i need to add something like    where  'ads state'    1    how can i do  i should put it into a specific matching  no 
i think i can help  this weekend i'll check the source code 
for a table   things   with _user_id_ column  bake setup this 
my table structure 
pgadmin doesn't even give me the option for decimal type  i should have given my system specs as well  postgresql 9 4 1 on x86_64 unknown linux gnu  compiled by gcc  ubuntu 4 9 1 16ubuntu6  4 9 1  64 bit  ubuntu 14 10  my best guess is that since postgresql stores money in the database with a dollar sign  e g  " 50 00  instead of as a true decimal number that the orm gets confused or something since it expects a numeric value but gets a string  it's weird that postgresql stores it like that rather than a number with a hundredth place  i'm new to postgresql  but thought i'd pass it a long
 markstory  i'm unfortunately unable to answer you       i could just suppose that the format is set somewhere as the conversion is done during read      i think that jose is about of the problem so  i'l let him take care of it     thanks to you 
 markstory local server is running on windows whereas i suppose that hosting should run linux  maybe a problem of character cases but i still didn't find   dakota  i'm probably not really up to date   
thanks lorenzo the problem was just solved by a cakephp update  i breath more easily 
i think to reproduce this  you would manually start the session prior to the call to validatepost    it will then throw an exception because the session is already started  i haven't been able to figure out what is causing this in my code to give you any more specifics about reproducing this error 
hm  now it works    thanks 
i'm not familiar with an autoloader and i just literally installed composer for the first time  i usually do things without package managers  i believe i followed the instructions of the documentation and no i didn't skip the loading of the plugin as specified here http   book cakephp org 3 0 en plugins html#plugin controllers
sorry  ignore the workaround  the issue is that passing multiple fields  doesn't work as expected and as designed 
my provider hasmany shades but every shade as a references  when i associate a new shade to a provider un want to set a default  ref  in join model  this  ref  is generate by a little condition before saving this new association  today i find a solution      just after patchentity 
it looks like this   it doesn't even work when adding  'user_rabatt_berechtigung'    true  although i thought this wouldn't be neccessary anyways because its a field that results from a relation  still  thats not the solution  it may be worth noting  that i can patch a different entity  that is related to  user  via  hasone   that works like a charm  the problem only exists when using  hasmany  and the code above 
well  i can try   
sorry and thanks for the explanation  i will use router  url
it is the best choice  but i didn't know how to do that  and didn't find any document for that
2 6 1   stable
theses queries are executed  but not in my foreach  data is missing with my foreign_key   1    
  test     foo  bar  the problem is probably in https   github com cakephp cakephp blob master src utility cookiecrypttrait php#l172
docblocks exposes getters  ie    method array getsender     as part of mailer class so yeah i could but still something is not right    
ok  i found it  i just forgot to mention the 'images' association in the patchentity options  yeah i know      still it shouldn't throw a fatal error like that so maybe this is something that could be fixed  the error occurs everytime you try to save a linked belongstomany association without mentioning it  i tried with the attributes association and it did the same   thanks for your help
theses are like "virtual associations" i set up in the behavior for convenience  as the association has the same name than the property i'm trying to handle  upload   i think this is causing the problem  i set up the association here    and then i later use the field of the same name of the association  i don't think that's an issue at all but i couldn't figure out someone to help me out on this  cause i'm clearly doing something wrong in building this behavior  all was working perfectly before i set up the associations  but i clearly need them 
sorry yes

hey mark  this plugin works on cake 2 x  it was made for cakephp  https   github com silasmontgomery cakephp full calendar plugin  not sure why it wouldn't work on 3 x which makes me think it is a cakephp issue  i have it on a 2 x version and it displays the events on the calendar  but updating it to work with 3 x is proving difficult  as cakephp 3 x is new  there isn't much information on the net to correct this issue  i am not getting any errors anymore  just no events to display on the calendar  if if isn't a cakephp issue  do you know where i can look to try and find an answer to this question  any help would be greatly appreciated  thanks  curtis  closed #6709 — reply to this email directly or view it on github

well  i expected the results to be ordered by id when first opening the page  however that is not true  they appear on random order  only when i click on the id they get sorted 
hi  it's something like this  it does work 
hi  i noticed this problem with other tables as well  here is a sample 
 markstory it should not  but the point is that the timestamp of the file  when it was last modified   is the same both when stored in  webroot and in the cdn  the file is the same  it is only fetched from another server  based on an existing file on my server  that is how the cdn we use works   thus having the timestamp  the local one  on the cdn path generated by cake  will make sure the file fetched from the cdn by the browser is always fresh  otherwise  even if i purge all the contents of the cdn  the browser may still use the previously cached file  because it has the same filename and path  and the cdn's caching settings are set to store for a 'long' time   thus  today or i use the cdn  and manually change the file path  or i use the timestamp and fetch all the files from my server  i am not sure the explanation is clear  but please let me know if anything is confusing 
db table structure is here  pastebin  http   pastebin com z1naltq1  here is some code i put into a controller method 
the assets are in my plugins webroot directory  i have a gulp task which copies these assets to my app's webroot directory  using the same folder structure   i was hoping that the html  css helper would use the assets in my app's webroot over the themes webroot  if i delete the assets from the themes webroot  the assets in my apps webroot are used 
yes  the security component is loaded in the other controller  i started testing with the same controller  action and view as i figured that should at least work  but setting the target with the url option pointing to the same controller and action shows that a different token is generated than leaving it empty  both methods generatie exactly the same form with the same target   the form with the target set by using the url option does not pass the filtering of the security component

i noticed that my cake   app is outdated i cloned again cake   app skeleton  and i'm doing the merge  i'll come back to confirm later   jeremyharris    benfarhat is the same as  cake   app   https   github com cakephp app blob master tests bootstrap php  thanks for your help 
i did check it in the code and unauthorised and unauthenticaded scenarios are handled differenlty  unauthorised throws exception  maybe some sort of ajaxview manipupation would do the trick but this is a workaround imho  8 lip 2016 04 36 "mark story" notifications github com napisał a  
yes  can i do that 
 markstory that's certainly an idea  but wouldn't that compromise on security  is there an intentional reason why an excluded action would generate a new token 
in this case  i need to pass conditions  like the old  scope  provided  i have a  project_id  that the users table doesn't know about that needs to be added to the query 
i added     'autoload'    true   to  plugin  load 'wholsalify'    so that it looks like this  plugin  load 'wholsalify'   'autoload'    true     and it works  closing the issue 
yes i did i was surprised my form do submit i checked debug kit request data but i don't know list categories is empty  this is my code    div class "posts form large 10 medium 9 columns"     div  
i know that i should not use echo in controller but i did this controller for testing purpose when i change  echo  to   this  response  body    it works like a charm but with  echo  even   this  response  header    wont work at all
yep  that was it  thanks 
i'm unable to reproduce  i create a brand new project with brand new tables and even with the old ones and nothing happened  my main project is are in production environment so it has lot of other stuff on it who may causing this  crud for instance   what i can tell is that the  row variable which was suppose to have an named array haven't  for users table it is this  1 "name whatever" "full name of someone"  instead of the expected  'users__id"   1 "name whatever" "full name of someone"  
 markstory i didn't found a suitable way to do it clearner  in order to run all my test  i've made an alltest class where which it's only method 'suite' add each directory where test files are  for some reason i didn't understand  fixtures defined in the array property 'fixtures' weren't loaded  but in this way it works  the alltest class   by running  console cake test app all   all test in those folders will be executed  let me know if you need more information or you think more research should be made 
yes  postgres and mysql will both accept almost any character for a column name if you quote it  but i think the whole regex method falls apart at that point  will open a pr shortly  thanks 
okay i've just opened    is it setting or getting components  i know clicking through to it will make me understand what it does  but cleancoders state that if it's named correctly  that wouldn't be necessary    redirect is extractable   render is extractable   referer is extractable  this method isn't that hard to understand  but for someone new to php  if this was to be a collection of methods that say exactly what each if statement does  it would be easier to follow   i do understand that as a core member of cake  you might feel that this is unneeded and a useless addition  but not only will it make it easier for a newbie to adapt php as his her framework of choice  it also enables the community to contribute more easily to the cakephp if the code is easier to read 
i try xampp on a windows machine  connect to the database ms sql server using ip can be connected  but i tried it on centos 7 server can not be  how to use it on a linux machine  please advise  what if using a dblib thank you
 lorenzo   yes i am currently using this datasource    also tried with 'encoding'    'utf8'  even tried with 'charset'    'utf8mb4'  any of these doesn't work 
the same way like using helpers  sure it looks super specific  but what confused me is that as a registry  it should extend  objectregistry  https   api cakephp org 3 5 class cake core objectregistry html 
i suppose i can   i'll take a look this weekend   next week 
closing as pr is open 
it worked   thanks   i think would be cool to see a example with this parameter  here  https   book cakephp org 3 0 en orm validation html#creating unique field rules 
hi mark  well     for this situation  the cakephp only works with the     toarray     approach  could even be a sqlsrv bug but as we can see on stackoverflow it's not the first time this problems occurs with cake and the comment about lazy approach was the hint for me to try the toarray   thing  if you want i could create a small foobar project to test this 
yeah they get aes encrypted with the app salt  i did not configure anything related to cookies  i have a basic app using cakedc users  i think the cookie encryption is default behavior  i checked the diff from 3 3 4 to 3 3 5 and there are some cookie related changes so i hope the bug is not on my end  i also checked the cookie components config and they both have the app salt as key  when i try to read a cookie in 3 3 5 it is an empty string but cookie  check   returns true  i figured since in 3 3 5 i can read the remember_me cookie written by cakephp 3 3 4  the problem lies in cookie  write in 3 3 5
i can't follow the logic behind this  i have commands  they are not sub commands  they do work separately as they should  there are some commands firing other ones with some logic  for instance  i have a command running every night  it checks the database and fires a command with different arguments according to the count of visitor countries  but i should be able to use that command with whatever argument i choose during the day since i need some daily reports time to time  within one of my old projects  i had a plugin including different shells for different cron jobs  a daily shell and an hourly shell  so i was able to manage cron jobs within my software layer easily  i doubt cases like this and many more are just my concern  the sentence  there are still many cases where you will want to invoke one shell from another though   is right from the  3 x documentation  https   book cakephp org 3 0 en console and shells shells html  so the suggestion is that i code a separate class  or classes  for my logic and call an instance within my commands  i highly respect you and sincerely want to learn and understand the logic behind this suggestion

ahhh that makes sense   
please ignore this bug  while trying to create a simplified test case from the original query i wasn't able to reproduce the issue  i went back and figured out what the problem was  i was trying to reference original query inside of the  innerjoinwith  function  example below   the following works fine in previous version but not in 3 4 8  after moving the  leftjoinwith  outside of the function  to where it's supposed to be in the first place  things were flying again  thanks 
thanks benfarhat
when i remove imap_open  the warnings are not shown  maybe the resource created by fopen in consoleoutput gets overwritten by imap_open for some reason  this is just thinking out loud 
passing arguments to finder fails to pass options such as limit for paging  is it a specification 
hi mark the query is like the following   select top 10  items   no_  as  items__no_    items no_ 2  as  items__no_ 2  from  gls72_ecommerce item   items    you   can check it up a t the following test site  sqlserver acmecms it
i defined the translated table in the translatebehavior setting linke the following      this  addbehavior 'translate'    'fields'      'name'  'subtitle'  'description'  'content'  'meta_keywords'  'meta_description'     'translationtable'    'gls72_acme_translations_i18n'       after that i get an error like the following   cannot describe g_l_s72_a_c_m_e_translations_i18n i have also created the translation model and set the table there with no results  rudy
 markstory yes this is exactly what i want 2 archive   garas  no i didn't tried that out 
echo  text is not rendering
 lorenzo i tried to change them to   lat  and   long  and other names too  but the result is the same 
just converted a date array to date type string  and unset the array  this does not work 
sorry  i mean the associated property field 
 dereuromark here you go
i'm working on a os 7 machine 
no  only the ones related to " 0  hour s"  no other occurrence of hour or hours in any cake po or any other po files resources locales cz it's part of " s ago" string when formatting timeagoinwords  this part   s ago  is interpreted correctly  ie  "ago" is translated  the  s part is the part where hour s  are 
finding the bug was the easy part  unfortunately  since i don't personally code against cakephp and don't have test rigs to test  i don't trust that i know the correct way to solve this issue  i suspect  adding those defines  and building a similar isset test that appends the 1 3 defines would work

i wasn't very clear in this example    the key issue is that hphpi thinks that  blah php test is a directory named blah php  with a file called 'test' in it whereas apache loads blah php this should be easy to reproduce if you use the url like my example  take any  php url you have and put  asdf at the end    in apache it would still load    hphp_home src hphpi hphpi  m server  p 8080  v "server sourceroot  pwd "  v "s erver defaultdocument index php"  v "log level verbose"  c    hphp mime hdf

do you mean overloading with a non param method  ex   string file  read     unfortunately the current read implementation is  string file  read int64_t length   0    even though that method just returns immediately if the length is or is below 0  i'm also not really sure how to _efficiently_ implement that

sorry  may i say not clear the same file complied hhvm  copy to other machine  there are some machines performance there is no problem but some machines performance twice as slowly  there is a problem of machine copy files and native compilation has performance issues  there is a problem of machines is twice as tall as not problem of machines consumption cpu  there is a problem os machine have the same problem  this problem is this machine not synchronization but i can't synchronization the time of the machines now but i'll think of some way to synchronous machine time   have synchronous time machine no performance issues  i doubt is the problem of time synchronization  don't know if i describe clearly you see if you can help me to solve thanks

jit is not working i guess due to my compilation problems  i'm now recompiling it  centos 6 3   i will let you know 
this problem is solved with the new nightly  thank you very much for your work and help 
the code is a fresh install of http   cubex io docs installation where is runs perfectly a few times  and then crashes after the 5th time or something  apc used to have this issue a while back  with traits   it makes it very difficult to be able to know what has actually caused the problem 
i don't have any small php code  in our scenario  we use a lot of php code which i being executed using eval on production  when i run load with my sample  it never crash but as soon as i put enable with the production traffic  so i am not able to figure out which particular script is causing this issue  is there a way to know the complete stacktrace of the issue so that a particular file can be identified  i was also seeing some runtime property called "maxstackdepth   1000"  what is this for  whenever i mention this  it says invalid property 
in case of zend  it return false as a return type for syntax error but in case of hiphop request exist instead of coontrol coming back to calling php

i agree that the security benefit is a key point  maybe  from my point of view  influenced by my background in the shared hosting business  a reload would be a wonderful solution in a shared hosting environment  e g  change the maxpostsize  a restart of the daemon is needed to reflect the change  during the restart all the served websites are down  the example of changing a port is not very likely  which is one of the rare conditions that need root privileges  changing the log location is also one  but this can be fixed by chown the new log location  this is a need that i see when serving multiple sites on the same server  but running under different users   each pool can have it's own configuration like user  port  listen address      in nginx apache each virtualhost will connect to a different pool  address port  to serve the requested page  the page execution will profit from the jit compiler because hot region are cached per pool  e g  symfony2 and zend framework 2 have a different "hot region" footprint  which are optimized per pool  every pool can be started as a different user  this gives an additional security isolation between applications  a vulnerability in one app will not compromise others  the pool architecture can also be achieved with multiple hhvm fastcgi processes  but it needs multiple init d scripts to launch all 'pools'  in a shared hosting multi domain environment it should be possible to add remove pools on the fly by reloading the pools configs  to achieve this the main thread that reloads the pool config needs to have root privileges  i hope i could clarify my point  i've a mixed opinion about this request  on one side it would solve some people's problem for multi site environments  but the security implications are not to be underrated  note  good reading about  nginx   the architecture of open source applications  http   www aosabook org en nginx html   it contains a section 'nginx process roles' that describes the different processes and their function including some notes about user privileges

 ptarjan i tracked it down  the #ifndef guard name is dependent on bison's output path  make parser sh has this   dir "   cd "   dirname " 0"  "    pwd  "  so  this is essentially the absolute path  so  the guard becomes  e g    +#ifndef yy_compiler_home_paravoid_hhvm_hphp_parser_hphp_tab_hpp_included  but make parser sh has these seds   …which means that the #endif is removed  but the #ifndef is not  hence cpp errors out  looking at #line comments  i see that the pre generated files have been generated with relative paths  is there any reason on insisting on absolute paths for third party users

sorry my technical ability is limited  but i believe there will be more of this particular question is being raised by a more professional people 
it's such an obvious and huge difference with php  i cannot imagine a set of circumstances would allow all those visible " n's" to seem reasonable  literally every other character is a backslash n  people cat and and tail error logs all of the time  it just boggles the mind 
the current behaviour is that mysql is the only one that ends up with  rpath set  unless i'm reading it wrong  post make install  as mentioned in the linked document  rpaths should be set during build to make sure it does use build local libraries  but then stripped during make install  here are a few distribution takes on rpath  debian  https   wiki debian org rpathissue   acceptable  but discouraged fedora centos rhel  http   fedoraproject org wiki packaging guidelines#beware_of_rpath   rpaths must be removed  unless the libraries are internal to the package  pld  strips rpath  via chrpath  implicitly by making it part of their rpm building scripts everybody else  currently  in hhvm  anybody who has chrpath installed  if compiled manually  will end up with rpaths stripped anyways due to https   github com facebook hhvm blob master cmake hphpfunctions cmake#l153 note  this issue came to my attention as it one of the checks during rpmlint

any news on fixing this issue  i'm pretty sure this would help a lot of people 
is it big enough  or other problems 
dear  orvid   i was using the default repo on ubuntu 14 04   with the    hhvm   is hhvm source with head activate to branch  hhvm 3 13   is there another options during the  hphpize  and  cmake    that should be configured  
for this output i used artisan tinker  but the results is the same in productive php code  i created an empty directory " tmp bla"  by creating an instance of recursivedirecotryiterator   new  recursivedirectoryiterator ' tmp bla'  4096     its getting an empty path and dir false  just testet in hhvm 3 15 0 
 jazzdan no  nginx user doesn't have permissions to write to the  run directory  i use below service file to start and stop hhvm daemon  so  is that above mentioned error important  and should i fix it 
sorry for the late reply i submitted an issue to the person who was instructed 
sorry  i forget to write the class name  i'm trying to achieve late binding on all class properties  so yes it is a shorthand for putting a   __lateinit   before every property 
at least hhvm 4 0 4  since that is where i noticed the build failure 
i guess my point is that defaultpromise should support cancellation and that channelpromise should as well 
yeah  i also found it interesting that the only explanation seemed to be that two different randoms produced the same nextlong  which i assume would really only happen if they had the same seed  and that also seemed unlikely  in any case  i'm on osx 10 8 3 w  java 1 6 0_45 b06 451 11m4406
the protobuf codec is used for the client server communications  it's just taking some user input  creating the relevant protobuf object and writing that over the channel to the server  here's a capture from the terminal where we're repeatedly sending a very small request to the server and we hit the issue 
i will provide an example soon  and i forget to say  the file handle leaks is really related to the bootstrap because when the client disconnect  the frontend channel  client to proxy  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   functions have been called  and the backend channel  proxy to server  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   have also been called  so even when these 4 fonctions was called  some file handle  related to the bootstrap was still open  i checked using lsof  p pid on linux

upon retrying  i too was running into some difficulty in reproducing it  i'm seeing it manifest itself in different ways on mac vs linux  don't have windows handy    on the mac the problem actually shows up as the process utilizing more cpu  when the netty server process is idle  as reported by top  however  on linux there's a spike and plateau of elevated context switches but the cpu utilization remains at 0  and load average stays at 0 00  here are the steps by which i am able to consistently reproduce it  some context   the mac system   darwin elcapitan local 11 3 0 darwin kernel version 11 3 0  thu jan 12 18 47 41 pst 2012  root xnu 1699 24 23 1 release_x86_64 x86_64   java version "1 7 0_04 ea" java tm  se runtime environment  build 1 7 0_04 ea b14  java hotspot tm  64 bit server vm  build 23 0 b16  mixed mode  at this point  once the clients have completed  and there isn't any new work coming into our server   you should see in terminal window 2 that the mac's top reporting a steady 10  of cpu being utilized and linux doing about 4000 ctx switches second  even after 10 minutes of all the clinets having been shutdown  i'm not seeing these numbers come down  i tried the alternative queue implementations with no luck

hmm how should i know that  there may be other resources that releaseexternalresources may closes for me  that i now have to hunt down and figure out what is  and close them  frankly if i provide a timer  then i can have its lifecycle  but all the other resources that are released from releaseexternalresources should still be done  anyway we got a workaround for now  also it is _not_ possible to provide a custom thread name determiner without passing in a timer too  eg we only have this method   so you can use a customer thread name  to have control of the thread names  which helps tremendously in a app server where people deploy many apps side by side

yes  but it might be a week or two  so i filed this in case the original author of the code or someone else is thinking similarly and wants to take a crack at it 
what about bytebuf extends largebytebuf  where largebytebuf is addressable by longs and bytebuf casts to ints  at the very least  the direct buffers should be able to support longs  potentially the pooled heap ones as well 
i can try to increase it but i doubt that will fix all cases  what about handling that status in sslhandler  i think this is the best way to avoid strange behaviors with misconfigured servers 
hi  it was globaly the idea to add a new awaitlisteners which could be notified after the last listener and thus avoid applications developpers to deal with the notification in its last listener  that's exactly what i did in my app's  thank for the answer  julien  le 25 juin 2013 11 36  "trustin lee" notifications github com a écrit  
first  note that we re use the netty promise classes with for our own defaulttransportmessagepromise  at a higher level than a particular event loop  the app uses the bind a thread to a loop model used by netty in order to keep some cross process state transitions sane  the error does appear after it has been shutdown gracefully  basically  during a shutdown  we shutdown several things very quickly  in series  if they all complete in time  there are no errors  but particularly in tests  we set the timing so fast    50ms  and shutdown so many things near simultaneously that all actions and notifications don't always have time to fire before the event loop is shutdown  my objection is not to logging this    it's usually a bug    but the problem is that it's at the error  highest  level with no way to mute it except muting the entire defaultpromise class  a perfectly acceptable workaround would be to add a version of addlistener   or a version of the defaultpromise constructor with a flag that disables this log message or reduces its severity  only a handful of messages in our entire application  all related to explicitly to shutdown  are affected  and the app is designed to recover from losing these messages  anyway 
i use 4 0 0 cr9
yes  the error is logged in an exceptioncaught  it is not causing the server to crash  but the request to not to be processed  stack trace   if the request can't be processed  or queued for later processing   a suggestion is to instead throw an exception signaling a http 503 service unavailable response 
4 0 10 final sorry for leaving that out  
nothing baked enough to propose with confidence  but it's definitely on my mind  my current very rough idea would be to accept a  promise  as an argument to  bootstrap#connect   but i haven't really worked through the implications of doing so 
my way to get unsuccess  may i am fool   1  i am go to that page  https   github com netty netty tree master example src main java io netty example objectecho 2  click on objectechoserverhandler java 3  copy paste in my intellij idea 13 4  ide says me that methods doesn't present in channelhandleradapter  5  when i rename channelhandleradapter to channelinboundhandleradapter   that works 
i just ran the html5 example and tried with chrome browser version 31  it behaved strangely  i was able to open websocket connection for the first time and then when i refresh the page it apears that web socket connection is opened but messages are not exchanged between browser and server  when i restarted the browser it works fine for the first time

i will try to reproduce this on similar environment  if there is any progress  i will update it here 
 normanmaurer works fine  thanks 
well   it do not work   that was what i tried  it stops drain memory but   no connection yet  but by log it seems like that guy described  yes  to get drain memory piece do search in file for "engine wrap"  that is place where it happens      repeated test  but stopped it fast so could get top of log  04 24 17 14 46 872 32648 354 net pasteover w system err﹕ android total fix  code  need_unwrap  consumed  0  status  okproduced  526 04 24 17 14 46 872 32648 354 net pasteover w system err﹕ android total fix  code  need_unwrap  consumed  0  status  okproduced  0 04 24 17 14 46 942 32648 354 net pasteover w system err﹕ android total fix  code  need_wrap  consumed  0  status  okproduced  6 04 24 17 14 46 942 32648 354 net pasteover w system err﹕ android total fix  code  not_handshaking  consumed  0  status  okproduced  53 04 24 17 14 46 942 32648 354 net pasteover w system err﹕ android total fix  code  not_handshaking  consumed  0  status  okproduced  37 that is working exactly as se version  except last line produces 37 instead 0 and it goes infinite 
thanks for the link  normanmaurer   i had already had a look at the wiki and set the leakdetectionlevel to see more and have been waiting for the next leak warning  however  in our implementation  everything looks actually ok and there had been no change in the source code since months before the deployment  until java 8 migration  i hadn't seen such a warning with jre7  the instances have been running almost for a week now  and in splunk  i can see this warning appeared only once per instance  we have 11 of them  and just after our latest deployment  since then  there is no warning any more  we have been monitoring the native process memory usage  in java heap  the gc works well and usage stays stable as expected  but i assume that netty allocates nio's directbuffers outside of the heap and increments the counter  and if the number of references to these buffers is not same as the ref count  then netty is suspicious of a possible leak  as i told  i see only one warning per instance after cut over and no more till today  what would it mean  should i expect more warnings on a continuously leaking machine  or it is fully sufficent to see once this message to make considerations on a huge leak   thanks you for your reply 
of course i grant you rights to include this unit test  thank's for the quick reply
hello  i see that it connects correctly to the proxy but at the end it open a direct connection to the proxied  without sending anything  but since the proxied is not mapped i got a dns error  unresolvedaddressexception   this is why i noticed this behaviour  is there something i could do for avoiding this problem  thank you 
netty 4 1 and no exceptions fired  as the remote end sends the last "kick" packet and closes the connection  the kick packet isn't received before channelinactive is fired  using autoread false as well as autoread true doesn't fix this behaviour  i hope that i didn't break btmdecoder and it's something on epoll level  https   github com ninja  netty blob 6fa4b1528fcc2e210417e6316a6e18944408876e codec src main java io netty handler codec bytetomessagedecoder java#l285 vs https   github com netty netty blob master codec src main java io netty handler codec bytetomessagedecoder java#l323 here's my idea   it should call channel read   to get the last data  like somewhere when epoll detects remote end has closed connection  i am reading some stuff about level triggered epoll and it would make sense to me  or just at btmdecoder#channelinactive level  but adding ctx read   didn't help
 jackoll8868 thanks for your answer  we are not releasing buffer in messagedecoder and messagetosectormessagedecoder  but is it the same bytebuf  if we are using bytebuf slice  code is here  https   gist github com juku 6035053d717d471a49b7a04e87a0abe1 https   gist github com juku 31633535be18071e8570f18736eae7f8
 normanmaurer sure 
sorry for not answering but thank you for fixing it  i'm looking forward to netty 4 0 34  👍

we don't clear about that  it's difficult to recur this exception manually  so we care about a problem   we use  try catch  to hide this  ioexception   can netty connect server again when create a new imsocketthread 
i'm using jdk 8 and windows 7 pro
i did this code  
 scottmitch the version is netty all 4 0 27 final，how to configure it so that he does not throw warn
i'm not using netty tcnative  it is finding the  org apache tomcat jni ssl  class because tomcat has it 
sounds better than releasing manually   
where can i find 4 1 6 final snapshot  and which tcnative does it do i need to build it  we tried using 4 1 5 final with the latest netty tcnative boringssl static 1 1 33 fork22 and observe the same crash  it runs as a standalone program on my ubuntu 14 04 host    sudo apt get install gradle   sudo ln  s  usr lib jvm java 8 oracle  usr lib jvm default java   gradle run  compilejava  processresources  classes  run sep 21  2016 9 13 13 am io grpc internal managedchannelimpl  init  info   managedchannelimpl 543788f3  created with target localhost 4999  run failed failure  build failed with an exception    what went wrong  execution failed for task ' run' 
i could send you the key as email  i would like to use it in production and github is not the right place share a private key 😅

 scottmitch  after reading how publish packet encodes i would assume that messageid in code is the same thing as packet identifier in spec  maybe it would be better to rename messageid field into packetid  can i create pr 
hi  normanmaurer   yes  the dead server means it do not resposne at all  hi   scottmitch   i have uploaded a wireshark capture files for both inetaddres getbyname and our netty dns resolve  for jdk dns resolve  it will query both dns servers  but netty will query only one of the two dns server for every url  dns_resolve zip  https   github com netty netty files 1118894 dns_resolve zip

 xiaoyulalala i have not solved this  sorry
oh    yeah  my bad  misinterpreted it while debugging leaked buffers 🤦‍♂️
confirmed  using 1 thread appears to make servermainbroken work
sorry  it's my fault  i think wrongly the method of onremoval will only be invoked by cleanup task however we could invoke initiatively 'remove' method of fastthreadlocal to release more quickly 
not really  i'm using netty inside a big application that i can't share  is there anything else i can do to help understand what is causing that 
 normanmaurer i cannot share the whole program  but i created a minimal reproduction  please checkout  https   github com marktiedemann netty repro 8248  https   github com marktiedemann netty repro 8248   many thanks in advance  hope the reproduction helps 
thanks  amizurov   new instance per channel  thanks  normanmaurer   we use idlestatehandler when connecting request recieved  the code is something like  ctx channel   pipeline   addfirst new idlestatehandler 600  0 0      in the channelread0   method of a sub class of simplechannelinboundhandler  when 160k clients connected  normally the instance number of io netty util concurrent scheduledfuturetask should be 160k because nubmer of idlestatehandler is 160k  but i got 16000k readeridletimeouttask  finally when i fixed this with my code  scheduledfuturetask drop to 160k  sorry  out of direct memory was not because of this bug  i am still investingating for the root  i think it may be cause by to many direct memory pooled in the stack 
in class idlestatehandler there are       handler should handle the   link idlestateevent  triggered by   link idlestatehandler   public class myhandler extends   link idlestateawarechannelhandler      code  override  public void channelidle   link channelhandlercontext  ctx    link idlestateevent  e    if  e getstate        link idlestate  reader_idle    e getchannel   close      else if  e getstate        link idlestate  writer_idle    e getchannel   write new pingmessage             i have found pingmessage is replaced by pingwebsocketframe  please  correct the doc 
 normanmaurer sorry  i ignored a checkpositive writespincount  "writespincount"  in the defaultchannelconfig#setwritespincount method  i was negligent  sorry  you are right  by the way  can incompletewrite writespincount   0  be modified to incompletewrite false  
 medusar using listener makes the code ugly  the use case of writeandflush   await is i'm encoding msg to a list of small messages and send them later in io thread 
this occurred sporadic in spring cloud gateway  i haven't changed anything because it's out of the box
 normanmaurer i mean that http2client already send  goaway  frame with  no_error  0x0   to indicate graceful shutdown of a connection  why netty http2server still throw  connection reset by peer  exception  
sorry  my bad  i think it is an android specific issue  until now the crash rate is not very high  i will pay attention to it  thanks 
 ocramius nothing actually   i tried that and i got nothing  
 composer zip  https   github com doctrine doctrine2 files 2420784 composer zip  "doctrine orm"  " 2 5"  "doctrine doctrine bundle"  " 1 6" 
actually i have an entity called offer that has onetomany relations with an entity called account  when i call findall   on my repository class it just returns the first record of the database but when i override the method and do this  pre  public function findall     return  this  createquerybuilder 'o'    select 'o  sa  sda  a'    leftjoin 'o sponsoraccount'  'sa'    leftjoin 'o sponsoredaccount'  'sda'    leftjoin 'o account'  'a'    getquery     getresult        pre  i get all the records 
sure  but how do i pass different arguments for different entities  if i want to generate an unique string but with different length for different entities using the same generator  how do i do that 
well it was my problem  mistake in code when defineing resultsetmappingbuilder 
 ocramius here's the idea  https   gist github com michal sk d3d3389bdabd14653a7b10dff1e60632 i was thinking that the criteria builder would maybe omit or have a different way of creating the value objects as where arguments  i'm aware that just 'foo' would result in an exception aswel  so would the right way here be to do a custom query 
thank you for your help  ocramius   item was empty before doctrine persist    my mistake  sorry 
it works on m product in 2 5 0 and 2 5 4  is it expected behavior  whatever zfcdatagrid gets is querybuilder instance and it may too much work to detect how to count entities 
yes it does occur before but the  commit  function "knows" whether a specific or any altered entity should be updated  unfortunately i cannot use the  onflush  event as my library does some preprocessing before any change sets are calculated  it just seems that the  preflush  event should be aware of the   entity  argument being passed into the method  i mean without it there is very little use for the event    or at least i cannot think of any uses  https   github com andreas glaser dc event bundle tree 1 1
 tony esales right  the  order by  could use the index of the alias  unfortunately that will not work for  select  and  where  clauses 
some simple suggestions   autogenerate_never   no message  this is okay   autogenerate_always   "proxy classes are always regenerating and will cause performance degradation "  autogenerate_file_not_exists   "proxy classes auto generate if not already existing  which may lead to performance degradation or failure under load "  autogenerate_eval   i'm not really sure how this one works  given the comment on it in the code  maybe a message about how it's questionable  sorry for the delay 
oh  good point  if it were a config setting in the dbal layer  simply pretending that the fields would not be there – are fks  indexes etc  an issue at all  sure  if you get this config wrong by hiding a field that is actually needed  you might be surprised why the schema tool tries to add it  but  either way  chances are somebody gets hurt  as to how filters could look like  i probably don't get the point    maybe a regex     
 ocramius yes  although the behaviour is slightly different  it's almost the opposite of 2 6 except none of the orders works properly    here's the full test file  https   gist github com sserbin 1904116d9cd241af7af06f68569f7cad
 ocramius
i totally get the code smell here  but what's happening is this entity still needs this property  but it's not stored in the db  so the getter  setter and property still exist  but we don't want it persisted 
 ocramius  doctrine orm 2 6 1   doctrine doctrine bundle 1 8 1 
i hava 2 objects is a and b    objb hava i wanna a and b store in one table  for example  a table hava name and age field 
  qb    this  em  createquerybuilder     select 'i'    from 'instance'  'i'    where 'i id    id'    setparameter 'id'   id   and  just in case it helps  the instance orm yml file domain model instance  type  entity indexes  patient_idx  columns    patientid   location_idx  columns    locationid   id  id  type  integer generator  strategy  auto fields  patientid  type  integer nullable  true locationid  type  integer nullable  true changelog  type  text nullable  true manytoone  form  targetentity  domain model form
i don't understand your question  can you elaborate 
i'll try the test case  but removing the wrong parameter type hint or actually passing an array of strings solves the issue for our code  so i guess it's really a "side effect we used so far" that has been removed  too bad i cannot remeber what we actually fixed back then by adding it…

try this one out 
i was hoping for the teal version shown at http   phantomjs org  
awesome  that's it  thanks guys sorry for the duplicate  apart from reading the release notes are the known issues published anywhere 
 jamesmgreene i'm running some unit tests using mocha phantomjs against a webserver 
the bottom two requests  commented out  to www britainfromabove org uk  same site  worked  last time i checked    whe tried concurrently    if the problemn host connection limit i'd expect it to fail here too  i also checked a asynchronous get request using plain node js on the problematic urls   got status 200  with the full bodies returned  i assume this would send similarly timed requests to the server  it looks like the isssue might be with phantomjs   though it's an obscure case

yes i did  i used microsoft visual c++ 2008  initially i only changed the openssl dir but that didn't work 
hm  thanks for the tip   the problem seem to be environment variable specific  when i run phantomjs from a console  everything works fine  on our production environment  however the process if spawned from a website hosted on iis8  which specify those variables as follow  appdata c  windows system32 config systemprofile appdata roaming localappdata c  windows system32 config systemprofile appdata local userprofile c  windows system32 config systemprofile      but than  i have another problem   if i try to set some other values to those variables  they seem not to be picked up   the specified folder   in example  c  temp    isn't used  example  set localappdata c  temp  set appdata c  temp   echo appdata is  appdata  phantomjs rasterize js "http   korrespondent net" "cmd_output png"
 ariya i'm installing using    head  flag  which i assume is pulling from  master   is  master  branch phantomjs 2  if so  this issue would be unrelated to #12622 
that did the trick  it's fixed  thanks  i know i appreciate detailed bug reports  i'd rather give too much information instead of too little 
no  i am not setting any specific height and width to viewport  setting height and width doesn't resolve problems 
just for the record  when i use console error "foobar"   in the main script context the result  win7  64bit  is   phatomjs doesn't crash in this case but there is an unexpected extra output  " 0 in error"

hi   according to the documentation _  remote debugger autorun yes_ is not required to enable debugging  http   phantomjs org troubleshooting html it's purpose according to the documentation is either way i tried adding it and it made no difference  i also tried the 1 9 8 binary and that didn't work either  has debugging been verified on windows 10 
i've created a test which will show the problem as well as verify the fix works  one thing to note is that this bug test is dependent on the order of the cookies in cookiejar  if for example cookies were sorted by expiration and the ones without expiration dates were first then this bug wouldn't happen  here is a test case that will show the problem  sorry this won't let me paste the file    if you need anything else please let me know 
phantomjs 2 1 still segfaults on my test script 
yeah i was running 2 1 1 on my local mac mini  19 2s   call   and my neighbor was running 2 1 1 on his mac mini  0 9s   call   this is definitely not the case for all os x 2 1 1 installations  but i have no idea what is different on my side  especially since downgrading to 1 9 2 resolved the issue for me 
using 2 1 1 of what  like i said before i am using version 2 1 5 
i test two "bad paths"  1  totally undefined 2  non existent file  well formed  both cause the machine to become non responsive  big red button only   since the machine must be physically rebooted at that point  each trial to narrow this down also does  no input possible   i'll not  or likely not  be able to get any output from phantomjs  or be able to persist retrieve any output  
yes finding the solution for this  that is  why phantomjs could not always return the perfect results  but sometimes it can  now i am using casperjs  this output is much better than phantomjs scraping  do you have any suggestion for this  
 vitallium hey  here is the debug message from  phantomjs gibdd js   debug true    btw  i tried changing  http     to  http   www   however it did not help  i thought it can be a problem with redirect from one page to another  because when you enter to  http   gibdd ru    webpage redirects to  http   www gibdd ru    additional info  i use digitalocean's droplet from frankfurt  can it be something related to location 
i can't right now  but really this issue i created was to have some kind of documentation showing what the errors mean  that way its easier to try and track down where the issue is  i have used debug but it only gets me so far    for example this latest error is evaluatejavascript result qvariant invalid  i don't even understand what the error means  so how can i understand what caused it  you know what i mean 
thanks gist url updated    ldd phantomjs ldd    phantomjs  no such file or directory
ok  phantomjs    2 1 its a basic code   analytics    time on page    0  in the middle of page open  i was try to click on links and others things  because i think that google analytics send data if you move the mouse or create other events 
apologies for the delayed response  vitallium  thanks for your response    upgrading to version 2 1 1 did in fact help  but  to future readers  using a lazy rendering approach may be helpful  this link was extremely useful  https   gist github com cjoudrey 1341747   i also used a proxy which seemed to help when connecting to an internal site  within our intranet   ## for phantom team   nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp i feel the error logging could be a tad more fruitful  again  i am new to the framework so please correct me if i'm wrong    i was consistently given an "operation cancelled error code  5"  this lead me to believe that i had a security issue when trying to connect to an internal site within our company  after some digging  and brute force attempts  i e  simply curling the site   i realized that my issue was not security related at all  the issue was that the site took some time to load all resources  but  setting a fixed interval of time to wait for those resources to load did not cut it either  using lazy rendering  mentioned above  is the best solution as it dynamically waits for the resources to load  i know this is sort of an edge case  but perhaps there could be a way to add some extra logging on top of qt's 'error code 5' error code  hope this helps someone  and thanks again for the help  vitallium 
sean  thanks for response  it turns out phantomjs' fs file conflicts with node's fs file and that was the problem  on nov 17  2016 2 02 pm  "sean" notifications github com wrote

i am using 3 7 1  i would love to give you some code but its confidential  but basically  i replicated the issue this way which crashed 100   although i don't use it this way  it still produces a similar error 1 out of 1000 scene changes  auto scene testlabelscene  createscene    director  getinstance    pushscene scene   director  getinstance    popscene      or replace but it basically seems like it happens if the resources are not loaded yet or something along those lines

you can simply wirite a sublayer using cclayercolor inside the helloworldlayer  set the rect to the right half of screen  then add a cceditbox inside the sublayer  you will find the cceditbox displays normal but without click effect  that means when you click on the editbox no keyboard will raise

 dumganhar in my first step  i download from official website  http   www cocos2d x org   and then download from github   minggo for cocos2d x 2 1 4 zip  i just unzip it and then open cocos2d win32 vc2012 sln and build solution in vs2012 express  get error message like this  error      "   debug win32 watermelonwithmeres"  "debug win32 cocosdragonjsres " and then i also have tried to run install templates msvc bat  then build in vs2012 express again  error is the same 
hi  minggo  thanks your reports  i am not sure if the error happens sometimes it's from bugly  and i have search the similar reports on google  i think the bug maybe caused by the life cycle of surfaceview or hardware acceleration   http   stackoverflow com questions 6039107 android glsurfaceview egl bad alloc  http   stackoverflow com questions 6039107 android glsurfaceview egl bad alloc   http   blog csdn net yaphetzhao article details 48240073  http   blog csdn net yaphetzhao article details 48240073   http   stackoverflow com questions 20152890 bug createwindowsurface failed egl bad alloc  http   stackoverflow com questions 20152890 bug createwindowsurface failed egl bad alloc  should i send this bug to the forum of cocos2dx

 minggo i'm using cocos2d x v 3 2 yes  it is not easy to reproduce  on some devices it not happens anyway  but on some devices  including default android 4 1 2 emulator  it happens always after some actions in my game  it never crashes when app is in foreground  only after locking unlocking device  maybe this is important  i'm using spine animated characters in my game  there is no crashes in ios 
cocos2d x 2 2 3  initially it was working well  but after i upgraded my xcode to 5 1 text is not shifting

hi  i had several  mp3 files and they were in range from 100kb   1 3 mb  but now i have changed them all to  wav files  and after that it does not crash and also the performance of the game has been significantly improved  but the delay in repeat is still there  also we are using 44k sampling rate  is that ok  or should we decrease sampling rate  there were not any more logs  thanks on wed  jun 28  2017 at 2 13 pm  james chen  notifications github com  wrote     best regards sohaib hussain
 pandamicro sorry i don't no how to send a patch to your via github  in cocos2d x 3 8 your added the 'libiconv dylib' library but in ios9 sdk this library was changed to 'libiconv tbd'
 andyque ime  english  us  i tested under ios 8 4  iphone 6 plus  and ios 8 3  ipad air 2  
i found a chinese article here  http   www cnblogs com leaven archive 2011 03 21 1989946 html you could google the function information to see whether we should use it    
 dumganhar do you know is it true that gl_texture_2d can't be multisampled like described  here  http   stackoverflow com questions 6342126 opengl render to texture in iphone fails when msaa is enabled 6343055#6343055  so i can use multisampling only with rendertargetrenderbuffer not rendertarget 
this issue occurs in cocos2d x 3 7  3 7 1  i'm testing on windows7 and android devices  on windows  when i set frame size 640x960  and add a new ui  button in center screen  the touch area is wrong  please check this 
ok i can write a test sample tonight 
here is my code jsb   _self bgaudioid   jsb audioengine play2d _self res bgsound  true  _self bgvolume   _self bgduration   0  _self bgtimerid   _self schedule function       because the loop option can not play audio again at once  so i have to check its current time and reset it 
after upgrade to 3 15 1  this problem looks like fixed already  thanks

 minggo my temp fix for it was when allocating a new __indices to save the previous allocated __indices without releasing it  it is only release on the next "reindex" call  this is not 100  fix  but it did stop the crash from happening  crash only appears on ios  but it may cause unknown errors on other platform  it all depends on what the system does with the free memory  realloc   causes the memory address to be changed  thus causing the pointers to be invalid 
yes

it mustbe no break compatibility。 every coroutine have own luastate，main thread is same。 all the cocos callback is in c++ ui thread， so it mean's all the lua coroutine is suspend  it is wait the lua main thread to wakeup  now the code callback with coroutine luastate  but this coroutine is suspend  so we must callback in the lua main thread 
i created my shader stored in glprogramcache with key shader_name_position_texture_color_etc1_no_mvp this bug appeared when game entered background  android os had no enough memory  clear the game memory then active game my shader can't work  later  i shared the test case

use native platform 1  create your own class with overriding method setposition 
there is no wrong in the engine code  but there is a hidden rule to use scripthandlermgr  i can't do this in my custom spine object  such as   actually  by modifying scripthandlermgr  handlertype to avoid use scripthandlermgr  addcustomhandler

 zilongshanren 比如你一个场景有两个layer，两个layer都有editbox，两个layer是不同时显示的，所以会隐藏掉其中一个layer，而这时候隐藏的layer中的editbox会响应点击，也就是你可以在上面输入内容，也会显示上面。测试样例不想提供了，这个是必现的。web版本找不到settouchenabled这个函数，报错是not a function

yes  but that would take some time  the jni part of my code game is no magic  it's based on  sonarsystems cocos helper  https   github com sonarsystems cocos helper   i'm using  of course  newer versions of the used services    but the jni part  functionality  is the same 
it crashes on random places  while the xcode debugger is attached to the app  disabling the debugger solves the issues  so i'm not sure if is something from apple's metal code or your integration with metal or both 
 aybakana thank you very much for the reply  it says  but i've included the  memory  header  clearly c++14 didn't get enabled  i tried using the methods i mentioned before in my other projects and they work fine

thank you  everyone  for all the feedback  it was truly a group effort to come to a conclusion on this revised experience  in short  the final outcome is to display "start breakout rooms" in both the "manage users" and "actions" buttons  we've decided to display it in two areas because  1  familiarity with existing bigbluebutton flash users  2  a prominent area such as the action button that way new bigbluebutton users _ moderator and presenters _ can come across this important functionality within the first few minutes of interacting with the software    manage users     html5 moderator presentor controls 1  https   user images githubusercontent com 1273169 50057948 b56e8f80 013f 11e9 89c4 40c5bc528a66 png    actions   moderator who's presenting     html5 moderator presentor controls 2  https   user images githubusercontent com 1273169 50057954 c7503280 013f 11e9 8f3d 9172f038bd8a png    actions   moderator   while going through this exercise we also wanted to provide a quicker way for moderators to take back presenter capabilities  which led us to the mockup below  including "take presenter role" within the action button    html5 moderator presentor controls 3  https   user images githubusercontent com 1273169 50057977 0da59180 0140 11e9 954a b37216a28600 png   ffdixon is there anything else you would like to add to the breakdown above

i used bbb install  when i use the computer's own camera or a normal camera  everything is normal  but when i used a very high resolution camera  logitech cc4000e  something went wrong  so i wonder if it's not possible to decode such a high definition camera
yes  i had installed previous version  i tried to get the latest release 
i changed   fallback language   to '  de  ' and restart html5 service  but it doen't work  i used private browsing to join meeting  as new user  
yes it exists so  i think it's successfully converted 
i did the installation by bbb install sh  i saw that there are some files stored in  var freeswitch meetings but thats file are only refered to 27 november  the recording that i made yesterday and today are not there  i follow the instruction suggested and from the iformation of bbb recording   watch seems that bigbluebutton does not recording audio  what can i change or verify  thanks every 2

 ghazitriki will ask the user to check this  though not sure how he can verify     pnijjar no it is not  with chrome and turn server  they can connect 
looks like the issue was fixed in greenlight 2 5 2 
i reinstalled ubuntu and bbb using a us vpn connection  and the problem resolved 
same problem here  with both browsers   so i guess that's not something that bbb can fix 
shell script from a gist starts gdb and make sigsegv happen right to your hands 
yes  this problem affect production use  because we run the risk of losing data 
 kostja because this is unlikely to happen in luarocks  for political reasons  plus  it's trivially doable outside of luarocks  we need to just parse the file and delegate execution to the existing luarocks functionality 
libcurl is not installed on my host machine  in cocker container the version is 
for example  we have huge load on instance and i want to see details   what's going on  with fiber list i got all fibers and information that is useless in this case  because i see  for example 50 fibers with name equals 'main'  all of them were produced by calls or evaluate request through iproto  but this is not clear  it will be good to see clear names for them  for example  "evaluate"  for evaluate requests   "modulex functiony"  for call requests

yes  fixed 
yes  glibc's  dlmopen  provides complete isolation  but fallback can be handled by the host application  i see a solution here and i wish also  antirez would consider it for redis  i'm speaking based on experience made maintaining frei0r and following ladspa  both large third party communities of plugin developers  the solution can be to add metadata that indicates loading options  and more  for plugins  such metadata can be either an external file  ladspa uses rdf  that goes side by side with the binary dso or a function symbol of the dso to be called after an initial  dlopen  and returning a struct of options  then the flow can be  1  read metadata  file load  or dlopen+setup   call  2  if setup   returns full isolation option  dlclose   and dlmopen   the dso 3  pass the dso pointer and process there may be more solutions  in any case i recommend you do consider the isolation flag as a desirable option for plugin developers 
sure  luajit is a third party and we won't to grow our own patchset 
this master instance have local space  we have huge insert rate using transactions to that space  on 2 3 2 replica stop with error in log  with 2 3 1 and older replication works good
i do wonder whether the beamer template should include the command  nickbart1980 suggested  so i won't close myself just yet  but knowing what to type solves the issue for me personally and so i am happy if you want to close 
indeed that was the perfect hint  https   gist github com 1437841 02d609401713aa29e98c75d46d3873e3cc271168 this works now with respect to the correct stdout output  i'll look tomorrow at why i get two identical svg snippets 
here is the chvt html file   chvt html zip  https   github com jgm pandoc files 1200992 chvt html zip  i now see the first line doesn't belong there  "content type  text html"   but i deleted it and got the same result  either way  i can view it in a browser 
great  so i'll close this issue for now 
i cannot reproduce this error anymore and don't now why it has appeared 
#1562 adds track changes support to the docx writer as well  even if it is not documented yet  nevertheless  markdown documents formerly produced by the docx reader  and maybe from someone else  with all track changes enabled     track changes all  and by intention   contains the track changes spans  these should be removed by acceptance in case of conversion to other output formats 
thanks guys re locale  re 1 9 2   i accidentally killed my cabal setup    will try upgrading the server to latest ubuntu   its got 1 9 1 1 cheers justin
then   data_dir filters   seems more appropriate 
as a simple example 
1  there is 4 representations of tables in pandoc and the  grid_tables  representation is the one that fit best with the vertical lines in a table  for me i expected this representation to have vertical lines when first using it   for me the behavior of the generated latex fit with the  simple_tables  representation but not with the  grid_tables   2  for the verbatims  i create a cell with numbers only  version 1 11 1   3  you can use     0 5em   instead of   noalign  medskip   
i'm using pandoc 2 2 1 a basic md file   command   pandoc example md  o example html  will produce  h1 id "title of document"  span class "header section number" 1  span  title of document  h1   h2 id "section 1"  span class "header section number" 1 1  span  section 1  h2   p text text text  p   h2 id "section 2"  span class "header section number" 1 2  span  section 2  h2   p text text text  p   h3 id "sub section 2 1"  span class "header section number" 1 2 1  span  sub section 2 1  h3   p text text text  p  the purpose would be to number only headers 2 and 3 
yes  we write for the web in html  with an editor   to display math on the web  we use mathjax  mathjax supports macro's  see http   docs mathjax org en latest tex html#defining tex macros   one example of a simple macro we use is  we use the same html source to produce latex  pdf and docx files via pandoc  for pdf and latex  we can use the macro in a  latex template to get the desired output  however  for docx  the macro does not work  a workaround would be to use a two step approach by first converting to latex and then to docs  however  i think a better solution would be to enable the existing latex_macros extension for html input 
for example  in tutorial 1 i could teach the code   so  besides coloring  i would like to highlight the added lines  yellow background  for example   i saw the pygments has this ability  but i use hakyll  which uses pandoc with highlighting kate  i saw one example of python and pygments  http   solarianprogrammer com 2012 03 19 syntax highlighting static blog python pygments   even better is the ability to hightlight just added or altered parts inside the line  for example  learningwebgl tutorial  http   learningwebgl com blog  p 370   this feature also is supported by jekyll + redcarpet + pygments  http   zpao com posts adding line highlights to markdown code fences  now i'm indicating which parts were added by using comments like " _   add this line   _ "  if there is the possibility in the future to use the resources  color  icons     to highlight altered content in a code  this code block's feature would be better and more interesting  thank you and sorry if this demand is for another component  highlighting kate for example  
thanks  while i was aware of them i hadn't realized that you could pass custom attributes to them and they're picked up by pandoc  yes  this could be pretty useful  i'm gonna see what i can do with them   
i found it in the  how to add a "table of contents" title in the html template  https   github com jgm pandoc wiki how to add a  22table of contents 22 title in the html template  page while i was looking specifically for that 
i don't know the internal details of pandoc data structure  i know the following feature  org babel's code tangle and weave  i agree with your solution  just parsing  no need to access external interpreters and compilers  etc 
my own error has long since been resolved and my own systems are insignificant for this issue anyway  i opened this isse to raise awareness that manually bumping a version's dependency on hackage breaks the build for all users of debian stable that do not use the latest cabal install  but the one from the debian stable repos  i imagine that for lots of users  pandoc is the first  and often only  contact they make with haskell and as such  lots of them won't know that they need to update to the latest cabal install before they can successfully build pandoc  imho there are 2 ways to fix this issue  either create new point releases when manually bumping  but then again  there's no need to manually bump   or add "update to cabal install    x x x to build pandoc from source" to the documentation 
from  http   shaunakelly com word numbering numbering20072010 html "word allows  actually requires  9 levels" word's lists only allow definition to 9 levels  and you can only link styles down to the 9th level  so the style linked headings go to  heading 9  in word  i think instead of stopping at  heading 5   see docs for    reference docx   pandoc should as well support up to at least  heading 9

ok  this isn't bug  i was wrong  i was wrong again  i had a problem with  confluence source editor  https   www digitalocean com community tutorials how to configure dns round robin load balancing for high availability   but now i figured out that  confluence storage format  https   confluence atlassian com doc confluence storage format 790796544 html  is not html5 but 'xhtml based'  why  according to the specification  https   www w3 org tr html5 syntax html#self closing start tag state  both variants are equally correct  but self closing variant is compatible with xhtml 
thanks for the clarification about    reference docx   i checked my documents further and saw that i hadn't formatted everything properly  now the styles in reference docx are working  sorry about the false notice  but the corruption issue persists  word presents me with a couple of dialog boxes and then says it was able to repair the file  see the screenshots in the previous post   since you had no problem  it's clearly an issue with my system  can't figure out what that could be  thanks for your help with this 
 jgm of course  that makes perfect sense  thank you for the explanation  and for an awesome tool  
more common commands  such as   neq  are contained in tex by default  but pandoc defines in  texchar hs  additional negated relations such as   nequiv   if they work in  html  for example  why not make them work in  tex   too  there is no package defining   nequiv  that i am aware of

i guess that #3537 would be somewhat better than the current solution since  markdown_in_html_blocks  would still be enabled globally  i would still prefer if i could use markdown link syntax inside the table  though  maybe it could be possible to require an empty line before indented code blocks like commonmark  does  http   spec commonmark org 0 27 #indented code block

yes  but simple tables are no good  if you have a block of text in a cell  then it becomes unpredictable whether simple table or grid table is generated  better always generate grid tables  from the user's perspective  extension is a mechanism to tell pandoc what the user wants  an automatic decision to use simple or grid table is ok  if a  +grid_tables  forces grid tables  or a  +simple_tables  forces simple tables  or a  +list_tables  forces list tables  this would also allow to use pandoc to convert table styles

i don't have a mac so all i have is ci log   bash has pandoc binary in path but when build system attempts to run pandoc it returns cryptic error  so it would be useful to know if binary works at least on one machine  that might rule out some redundant bugfixing work

thanks for your response   code git   version git version 1 6 3 3   code  a little outdated but could do  i found the problem  i was trying to install this on a alwaysdata free account and it's limited to 10mb  it's far from enough to get the diaspora code  i'll have to find another way  o 
i would say no  for example i use tumblr and write blog  i would put those into diaspora automatically without any extra application   or do you mean some server side apps  
is it really needed to have a so long tags  or could we limit the lenght of tags 
i've updated the issue  maybe its more reasonable 
i am getting somewhere  i've been experimenting  so far  i have something mostly working  except that it looks like deleted "likes" whose parent is remote may not update instantly  i don't know why  the bigger issue is testing  at the moment i can't think of a way to write a meaningful test  given that we need to test the worst case of a race condition 
 maxwell i think it could be useful to render the whole list  the same way it was implemented in the past   i'll check the code and see if i can do it

yes  that's the correct content type for post request and it works  but for a get request it doesn't  i had to change it to application jsonrequest  see https   github com spkdev diaspora rss bot pull 7  as i already mentioned  this works for  stream  so i think it is correct  btw   if i use application json for  stream i get html output as well  so jsonrequest seems to be required  and if i use application json for  conversations i get the whole webpage including javascript stuff and the like  but if i use application jsonrequest  i get only a html fragment  just the div's of the conversations  so diaspora  or ruby on rails  that is  responds differently to the different request header  which is good  but i doesn't respond with json

there must be a lot of users blocked by this insignificant issue for a week already  although it's fixed in the code  it's not fixed in joindiaspora org and closing it will hide it from the users affected 
 maxwell  that _was_ today     i wrote the issue as i was going through the steps  i don't know if that's related but i have quite a lot of crashes from the thin server  i'd say about once a day on average  and keep in mind i'm the only user on that pod  and i only have a handful of contacts so far   maybe data that needs to be broadcast to other pods gets lost after a crash  and is not queued up again when i start the process again  i created another test user on  diasp org  and i get similar behaviour  i have to wait  10 min for the webfinger to find it    it's not really a big problem but it seems strange to me still  then  i get the same kind of asymmetric communication problems  my new test user sees a public post i wrote way before it was created  but not a public post i wrote 45 minutes ago   15 minutes after the test user was created   the test user got the follow notification  but not my user on my pod  etc  how can i find out what's wrong 
if the person has any contacts in common  also  a button to add the person to an aspect  using ajax   well  that's just my ideas  anything is welcomed

hmm i just retested it with my completely unhardened chromium  and i get the exact same results  when i click on the link in the text it is working  when i click on it in the title of the automagically loaded preview i get the wrong  ho 404 link  the previews of the link work correctly   hovering on the top shows the correct link    hovering on the lower one shows the wrong link  clicking on either of these open the links they previewed   i also stumbeld upon a heise post once where someone commented that the link is not working and then commented again that the top one seems to work  so i doubt its only me  thus i tried again to explain more precise where i clicked    
no dice  the problem persists  i tried hitting the site with chrome developer tools open  but i see no errors  if it helps narrow this down  it doesn't happen on the landing page  but does happen on the sign_in page and stream 
sorry i was not more clear  this was a screenshot of my notifications view from yesterday  october 4th  in the screenshot  you can see that it shows that posts happen in the future  on october 5th  but that is not true  a post cannot be made in the future  there is no scheduling of posts or actions  it should say in my local time when this happened 
right it's ie11  in mobile display mode

 deadsuperhero hi and thank you for your answer and interest in this  as it is right now when i click on an image it covers only a fairly small part of the screen for me    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 10245688 32923898 4d0e95b6 cb3a 11e7 94d2 62454b393713 png   if i right click on the photo and choose "open in new tab" it has the same size  it would be nice if there was an option to go to full screen  even if the file is smaller than full screen this may still look good another thing would be to increase the max pixel size of the allowed images  but i can understand that you have limited bandwidth and the hosting costs money a third thing is to increase the size of the image in the view that you get by clicking on it  as in the screenshot above   this could be done either by "simply" increasing the max pixel size  or by scaling up the image again  thank you for what you're doing  i appreciate it and i'm trying to spread the word to my friends kind regards  tord
i think they did this on purpose on tor browser  any chance the choice for the push permission could be set in the user settings in diaspora  this would have the advantage that the setting would stay the same in any new browser that diaspora users are using 
i believe if you put it at the end then facebook will not render any of the urls but i can experiment with it manually  if it works then always putting it at the end makes sense to me

yes  all shaders i've tried  it affects the gamegear core only 
no  still the same here  if show advanced settings is off  saving menu does not crash   if show advanced settings is on  saving crashes if it matters  im using compiled version  and then used" sudo make install" from libretro super retroarch folder to install it  on a newly installed arch linux 
huh  you're right  so it's just a matter of binding them in the default config 
still having the same issue with the latest commit 
i don't know how to find that  but a quick search on google i found this which might be relevant http   lists freebsd org pipermail freebsd bugs 2013 november 054530 html gdb shows me nothing  it just says program exited with code 02  and bt says no stack 
i had assumed that for my 32 bit host i would need mingw32 and that mingw64 would not work  i assumed wrong  i did not even know they were seperate projects  with the former stalled  pardon the ignorance and noise  i downloaded mingw64 and built retroarch without issue  thanks for the info  since the patch already landed  i pulled and tried building again with mingw32  which died on lack of a dsound h  previously it was also missing a dinput h   actual mingw32 support looks like it could take more work and not be worth it  before downloading mingw64 from the official site  i tried using the  bundled mingw64  http   forum themaister net viewtopic php id 467  you kindly offer on your forum  but that failed thusly   a cursory googling suggested the solution was to reinstall mingw  if you care about supporting this bundle  in particular  i could open another issue

this occurs on any core as far as i can tell  tested with snes9x and vba m 
sorry cant remember i have restart my retroarch config from scratch  the problem i have now is there is no rgui option to disable bilinear filtering only way i found is to manualy set smooth to false in retroarch cfg
you were right indeed  the path now gets set correctly

how i obtain the last git code   when i launch git submodule init and git submodule update this does nothing
 aliaspider i'll have a look and get back to you  that's a good suggestion i hadn't thought of to be honest 
i didn't see anything but i force disabled vsync for retroarch in my driver's settings and it still didn't work 
i used   per this thread  https   www raspberrypi org forums viewtopic php f 78 t 56070 edit  i also tried compiling using the pkgbuilds in the aur  here  https   aur archlinux org packages retroarch git     here  https   aur archlinux org packages retroarch git rpi    and  here  https   aur archlinux org packages retroarch rbp git    all fail at the same part of the compile process with the same errors 
no  i'm not comfortable modifying the makefile and my 'solution' is a hack anyway  if you're curious i just added the bold    q   link   o      rarch_obj    libs    ldflags     lstdc++     library_dirs  a better solution would limit the version of the submodule and maybe talk to upstream if they really need that and if they really wanted to do that  since it's only 1 error   or make a patch to the git submodule or something like that  don't know how to do any of that  so it's not done 
i already have most of the 'plumbing code' code except for the translations  i'm currently blocked on implementing the 'actual feature'  i know what i've got to do  a else if on a if in 'manual_content_scan_get_playlist_content_label' to bail out if not recognized and the setting on   but i want to have a use case ready  so i'm working on transforming the retroplay dats into something 'like' the mame format  to see if it can occur like i want to test it out i don't think it's a good idea to deviate from that format either  after i noticed how many tests it's doing  the only thing i want different is removing the 'filter' of 'only compressed files' and replacing it by having that 'only files from the dat' as default on  because ofc  many cores that could have xmls on a 'mame format' have exotic compressions or none at all  case in point  whdloads are in ' lha'  ' hdf' or ' hdz'  anyway that work might actually lead to a script pr to libretro database  because i'm trying to make it so that the 'description' holds the  x_name  https   openretro org amiga cluedo master detective edit#acd5c8f8 77f8 59c3 8254 775a68b1e32c   derived from the filename  of  most well named  whdloads in the retroplay set  that then can be used  hopefully  to find the 'real name' of the game  and 'images'  either by import of  the images  https   openretro org download  into libretro database  or seeing if the openretro database 'real name' is the same as the 'real name' on the libretro database amiga images  this may have to be a 'fuzzy' search  if possible  because whdloads are more or less constantly churning versions so a exact match may not exist  xpath xsl 1 0 is kicking my ass with how primitive it is  maybe i shouldn't have used bash+xmlstarlet for the script but python    
in the eshop  xml  there is a category called  arg  that passes an argument 
i have edited my op with bisect
i will but i can't tonight    about your earlier comment    i did do the presets after the overrides as i originally had the overrides in place to specify the overlay  res  and shader choice  i simply deleted the line for the shader  loaded the game  and then tried saving a preset 
i haven't thought of that  i'll try it and report back  i usually don't do that  but i'll give it a shot  oddly enough  the regular snes9x  non next  core doesn't exhibit this behavior  nor does the genesis plus core  i'll try to isolate it further 
i'll say my preference although of course this is open to debate  my idea is to have it a separate tab  because favourites  history and this new implementation would then serve three different and equally useful purposes    history is for the latest content you have run  a purely chronological list     favorites is the content you particularly liked and manually chose to include    most played would be a list of titles exclusively sorted by playtime  because of this i was thinking of even having the content numbered  exactly like on the 3ds diary   the way i see it  the ideal scenario would be to have them co exist as unique tabs because of these separate functionalities 
how can i check 
it is windows xp
currently that is the default behavior but it should extract to   platform_dir  tmp  on 3ds that would be sdmc  retroarch tmp  to prevent destruction of files with the same name 
t1254362  i can see what you think but it is wrong because you are considering only the sega genesis 3 buttons controller  look this pictures    233796_detail_01  https   user images githubusercontent com 23250218 34590839 822d5700 f1a0 11e7 9fdb 5c5d48a3e24f png    hori fighting commander for xbox one  66044128 zoom  https   user images githubusercontent com 23250218 34590849 8cb9708c f1a0 11e7 809b 8ae66ab6fdc6 jpg    pa 24131 002  https   user images githubusercontent com 23250218 34590853 93d72ada f1a0 11e7 9823 41a4b71132d4 jpg  in both  they just put the shoulder buttons in line  when the sega created the 6 button controller to street fighter games  the simple and best way was just adding another queue of buttons  xyz   making the layout very similar to the arcades  but the proof that the current layout is strange is just try to play sf2plus or ssf2 of genesis using a snes or ps2 controller  you will have this  y   lk b   mk a   sk l   lp x   mp r   sp now  compare with the original layout of street fighter in snes    81338 super street fighter ii snes screenshot options  https   user images githubusercontent com 23250218 34591172 d08c3f72 f1a2 11e7 97d5 03e9716fb0a5 png  can you see  and changing the layout of retropad to sega saturn and sega genesis 6 buttons controller will be a enhancement to the owners of snes and ps1 controllers too  currently we have  y a b b a c naturally we can do the combo a+b and b+c  but it is uncomfortable to do a+c  you are forcing the players to assign the combo to another button like x  l or r  with the layout below  b a a b r c naturally we can do the combo a+b  b+c and a+c without any kind of extra configuration  
this feature isn't particularly necessary on pcs or systems where you have full access  but on console systems  like the vita for example  even with access it's not the kind of system that supports shortcut creation  so using commandline arguments via shortcuts isn't an option  my thinking was less to make this about catering to specific launchers  which is a complete fools errand i'm aware  but instead providing a dumb general purpose "hook" to take advantage of retroarch's existing abilities from various systems with more limited interfaces  in theory this should be a simple feature to implement that shouldn't require any real upkeep once added  run the commands in this  cfg  then optionally wipe it  ignore if it doesn't exist  for consoles this would be wonderful  and moving forward  it's possible very few consoles and other systems will have as much access as exploits in the past have  so having an alternative method for these systems to deliver their commands to retroarch would be helpful  on the vita and ps3 for example  passing along commands to launch  self files is not possible from their main menu  so you  have  to use some kind of frontend like retroarch  and cannot go directly into a core  even something as simple as a startup cfg would allow systems like a semi compromised nintendo switch for example  to take much more advantage of retroarch via web frontends or other methods perhaps  i'm hoping someone else can see it also as a simple and beneficial idea  certainly not high priority for the roadmap  but a simple feature to include one day  though in my own case i would find it immediately useful for the aforementioned console scenarios 
update i tried playing using bluetooth keyboard the problem occurs the same when i used 8bitdo zero controller  the lag happened  the game stop for a split second when i pressed any button on the keyboard that i set for input in retroarch i think the problem is the keyboard input  because 8bitdo zero controller is keyboard based  that makes the same input for bluetooth keyboard and 8bitdo zero  the nimbus controller works fine because the input is controller button  button 0  button 1  etc 
 twinaphex thank you so much for responding  i'm really glad all core are fixed and everything goes well  but as i said there's something wrong in retroarch via your cydia repo  i hope from  yoshisuga to find a solution for this  i also want to ask you can we run pcsx recomiler  using jit   on jailbroken ios 10 2 please  it's been long time and we really miss this  i also saw  alex793 said every cores are working great after doing some fixes  any idea please 
they all have the same problem 
pico works on the new version  albeit it has way more input delay than gpgx on our windows to windows sessions  the only other cores we've tried are bsnes  balanced  and mednafen  bsnes gave the same error  while mednafen connected but had extreme audio and video stutter  is gpgx's lack of cross platform support due to the core itself or its implementation within libretro 
 retroarch zip  https   github com libretro retroarch files 1106585 retroarch zip 
uh wut  i didn't even remember posting this  i remembered posting another issue  people have been reporting that the latest version of retroarch runs much slower on 3ds  and this doesn't seem to be related to any cores  it's happening with all cores in general 
thank you again for the reply ies   it seems restarting the pc for whatever reason did the trick  no idea why that was necessary but i'll take it  p
yea sure  i have created a playlist  two but thats irrelevant  that i want to hide in retroarch for the time being  a simple conversion of it to an archive format  zip  rar  7z etc  does just that  if i open ra  the playlist is hidden  yet its still there  as an archive  in the playlists folder so a  when i run my backup script it gets backed up  and b  i can extract it at any time to re add it or modify it  most of all  it keeps it easily visible due to the contrast between the lpl icon and the archive icon   im old   p  anyhow  the one place this doesnt hold up  is if you open the desktop menu as opposed to xmb ozone etc  there  irrespective of being archived  the playlist shows in your list  except for it now shows as a blank folder icon with a bunch of garbled text  presumably due to being archived and unreadable  so what i was asking for is to make the desktop menu behave the same as the gui  hide anything not in  lpl format completely from being displayed as a playlist  the step by step would be simply  1  archive an existing playlist 2  open retroarch and notice its no longer present 3  open retroarch's desktop menu and notice that it is still present  in a broken capacity i hope that makes more sense 
no  savestate screenshots are off  since i was playing ff6 for gba  thats where it was happening  but only ever since the 1 6 6 update  this was never an issue before  which is why i suggested there might be a hickup with the newly added undo save state and undo load state functions that occasionally causes this freeze  since they're new  savestate related changes  but its really just a guess  i'm not sure what you mean by filesystem speed  but the time it takes to savestate a gba game when its working is still the same as it was a year or so ago  i'm using a class 10 micro sd  not a fake  and it's not just taking a while to finish  the entire system is frozen when this happens  no reactions to buttonpresses or tapping the touchscreen  which would usually open or close the retroarch menu   this is new and unusual behavior 
yes  this solves the problem  thanks  strange though  that it isn't a problem in the earlier revisions 
i don't have an linux environment and i'm not willing to make an vm  does it not crash for you  just keep using the rgui menu controls until it crashes 
 hizzlekizzle no seems to works properly like a normal window 
it works now  thanks 
 robloach i don't know if i'm doing this correctly because i never had to check the crc of a file  i got them with a free software called "rapidcrc"  then i got the same results after trying to get them with a different software called "gui file signature widget"  dragon ball z  extreme butouden crc  1dfb08dc pokémon omega ruby crc  732f7ad3 the legend of zelda  ocarina of time 3d  crc  6c9329d0 i just compared them  and while oot3d seems to be missing  the crc of my roms don't match the ones shown in https   github com libretro libretro database blob e83f0bef1951e4cd9e8417ea02ba0c7879e2aa52 metadat no intro nintendo 20  20nintendo 203ds 20 dlc  dat i suppose that is the issue and retroarch only recognizes 1 specific kind of dump  is that correct 
so  funny story  it slipped my mind of just how case sensitive linux is  i was pointing the playlist to bahamut lagoon  eng    smc    when the actual file is bahamut lagoon  eng    smc   fixed the case sensitivity on the affected roms and they all work now

it's #7607  c32c98e667 itself doesn't actually build  linker complains about duplicate symbols   but that makes sense  it's the  xdg shell  implementation that has the bug

i understood that the lakka version is different  i'm going to post the error at https   github com hrydgard ppsspp issues  even so  in case it's something of the operating system itself  it's been a long time since except me ppsspp does not work properly for me
 orbea i am not sure if i find the time today  but i should be able to do it no later than tomorrow 
that is possible  making that a default option is best because one of the first things anyone will do is add a controller  this is giving a bad impression  just my two sense  close the bug if you wish

i'm having the core updates snes9x 1 57 in the download options nightly linux armhf  i use the lakka os 2 1 1 version for tv android box with amilogic s905x processors  1 51 ghz and with 1 gb ram  i tested on two tv box models  the two present slowndonw in the certain bubble crab phase of the game megaman x2  in the part when it appears that when big robot fish the game has fall in up to 58 fps  and also tested with old standard snes9x core that comes in the lakka os in the case of snes9x 1 54  1 frame crashes are worse  reaching up to 54 fps  now my doubt is if this happens for lack of optimization of the updated snes9x core for tv box s905x or lack of tv box hardware that i use  stranger than games with fx chips that are much heavier to emulate than megaman x2's cx4 chips and without the use of the video threading option run like a feather without gagging anything at all

i have cores for all the titles  the scan is succesfull on my android and windows setups with the same content  so i assume that the titles are on the database  about having the database file  i'm not really sure  i've downloaded it with the online updater and i have a bunch of  rdb files on    config retroarch database rdb 
sure  this is the expected results  and the results when using 'gl'   1  https   i imgur com 8teocc3 png  these are the results when using 'dispmanx'  notice the screen always scales up to the full 320px height    2  https   i imgur com pcpb7wn png  these are captures from the hdmi output of the rpi zero using dispmanx_vnc  essentially duplicates the hdmi port and sends snapshots via a vnc protocol   i am using it for testing while my spi display arrives 
i apologise  i am new to git and i'm not sure where to begin identifying the point where this failed  this is also complicated by the fact that for the previous full release  1 7 6  shaders didn't work at all  i assume this was to do with the transition from opengl 
i updated all stuff through the online updater before performing the scan  i only have 1 core downloaded  which is mame 2003 plus the roms are valid and named with the usual "8 character" mame convention  they play perfectly on both windows and android if opened  they are in full non merged  torrentzipped format  they are correctly detected and added to a playlist if folder scanned or single file scanned on windows  they are recognized and added to the playlist on android only if file scanned 
normal wireless xbox one doesnt have the issue  and it persists across any core  i tested with dolphin ra vs standalone  as well as n64 and even snes using the "retroarch rumble" cheats  this only occurs in retroarch  the cores i've tried are dolphin  mupen64 plus  and snes9x with rumble cheats for link to the past and yoshi's island  it is xinput as it is an xbox one controller

there is a cheevos token in your config  not sure if its a security risk to share that 
 hizzlekizzle the method you propose would only upscale the last pass  it can work in some simple cases  but the proper solution is a bit more complex 
hmm  i disconnected my second non gsync monitor  the dell one  and ran retroarch and could reproduce the problem every time  i restarted the computer with the second non gsync display disconnected and was still able to reproduce the problem

yes  this happened again  i've written a restart script that restarts the graylog server when no massages have arrived for 5 minutes  i just added the jmap and jstack calls you suggested on the mailing list so when this happens the next time the script will dump the output of these two commands into files before it restarts graylog  i will report back once this happens again

using the elasticsearch api  the problem is that when setting the allowed maximum number of indices in the server configuration  the web interface would only display this exact number of indices  these indices were always open  the only active buttons in the web ui were 'close index' and 'delete index' and the closed but retained indices would not show up  not being presented with appropriate manuals made me resort to the es api  i'm glad to hear that this seems to be resolved in the latest beta  i'm looking forward to testing it by myself  thanks 
yes it does 
none yet  although i only have the 10 40 messages second   just worried as it indicates massive amounts of object instantiation  a way to combat this is typically to use object pools so that objects aren't orphaned   but i know more about this in c# than i do in java  so i can't speculate on the performance abilities of it  good product though

it is the default  to match all   must match all of the 2 configured stream rule s    testing one message that was wrongly routed in this streams says that "it will not be routed to this stream" and that only the facility rule matches  if it makes any difference  those messages were also routed in another stream based on the source  and this is correct 
my use case also requires to mute globally from queries this specific field  as your "streams" one   which is today impossible  no

well  here's what i've done    on the hosts run a journalctl  o json  f   ncat  ssl       graylog server 22201   on each graylog server run a ncat  ssl  l 22201      journald2graylog 127 0 0 1 12201 run a udp gelf input on 12201 that way  i can ship logs without adding any 3rd party log shipper on my hosts  but as systemd is now on every distro  and so does journald  journald comes with the journalctl upload tool  if graylog could implement a journald listener  we could ship logs very easily
yes  i'm using nginx as proxy   etc graylog server server conf  nginx  it was https on nginx with self signed certificate first  now it's http for debug  same result  
maybe it should rather be documented here  http   docs graylog org en 2 2 pages sending_data html#gelf sending from applications a new section "gelf via tcp" just above or below the existing "gelf via http"  ### gelf via tcp you can send in uncompressed gelf via a plain tcp socket  each message needs to be delimited with a null byte  ' 0'   compression or chunking is not supported 
hi  jalogisch   currently i'm trying to create a content pack where i define a stream and an input through java code  the rest url is   api system bundles  both the stream and the input are created correctly but the input is marked as not runnig with the error message that i wrote before
i expect that in the config file  we can specify the frequency for the rest api calls  for example  after login  currently every 5 seconds  there will be a get request https    graylogserver  api system cluster nodes i expect we can config the frequency for this call to another value  like 10 seconds  similar for the following rest api calls  i expect we can config the frequency to a different value  https    graylogserver  api cluster metrics multiple  post  every 2 seconds  https    graylogserver  api system notifications  get  every 3 seconds  https    graylogserver  api  get  every 20 seconds 
need to be able to define user role by another role and not all  admin   for exemple a sub admin group 
 bernd for the 'securely store credentials' part  i'm simply asking to be able to input them in the gui and allow it to be changed  but without showing the actual password underneath  akin to other password fields in graylog like for ldap  so the really low hanging fruit variety at this point  nothing really sinister  i just don't want an auditor foaming at the mouth over cleartext credentials visible in the gui  also is there a date for release of 2 4  i'm having an issue where the authentication in the url isn't actually being passed by graylog to the appliance  giving me a 401 authorization required  same url structure works in chrome   i'm trying to get data from an infoblox grid master via their wapi    https   www infoblox com wp content uploads infoblox deployment infoblox rest api pdf
i can't find the log file    usr share graylog data log  and    usr share graylog data log  are empty inside the container where should i look for the log file inside the docker 
steps to reproduce the problem  1  install graylog server from docker image graylog2 server2 3 2 2 + elasticsearch 2 + mongodb 3 2  on monitored host start containers described in docker compose file  where added parameters that docker will use gelf logging driver and added custom tag for each container  example of container description in the post above   2  start and log in to graylog server ui 3  go to tab system and create input gelf udp    bind address  0 0 0 0   port  12201 other parametes   default 4  next move to tab source   in time period parametes choose any   in search field type for example   error 5  and that's it 
currently just one instance with as many resources as it needs  also recored a short gif when idling on the nodes view to illustrate the effects  https   giphy com gifs xulw8ttalvjzve2v3o fullscreen edit  asking about the mongodb gave actually a good hint  the mongodb uses about 0 2 cpu and 140mb memory  nevertheless other mongodbs in the cluster had an issue with storage being slow  hypothetically if mongodb write back is slow this could cause bigger inconsistencies between different clients than usual without acid  therefore if cluster status is resolved solely on mongodb content  this might explain the unreliablities  i am still waiting on a pr for rook to connect the nvme storage into the cluster  but this should be resolved within the next few days  i'll see if this reduces the unreliablities

i've just tried and i can't replicate it on the kitchen sink  that's strange  i used the exact same code 
https   jsfiddle net 7g4k1rrf 4  i can't replicate the bug using the master branch  i guess i have to switch to the master branch and rewrite some code 😄
i mean that now with fabric i can only move  rotate and scale objects  but i can't animate them  sprite animations like in gamequery http   gamequery onaluf org  would be nice 
hi    kangax    thx for ur response  _are you including excanvas js _ no  but now i do  and my testpage works fine  where can i read about other libs  now i'm using only excanvas js    _which ie version _ ie 8   thanks a lot

i have solved it but there is one more issue when i am creating group its border is not updating sometimes its angle is not proper i am using below code group   new fabric group   text1 clone    text2 clone    text3 clone    rect clone        width  rect width  height  rect height  rect left rect top rect angle    where rect is a rectangle fabric object whose width  height  left  top and angle are using to create a group can you please tell me how does fabric creates group implicitly when we select an object with its angle 
when we export canvas to svg  the document size is based on canvas size in fabric js  and it usually small  so when we convert the svg to pdf  the image is with low quality  to resolve that  we think we should resize svg  much more efficient than resize canvas   and then we found that we can use document size of svg and viewbox attribute to achieve that  then we turned back to fabricjs tosvg function  see if we can change document size   viewbox attribute  the result is we found that we can use viewbox attribute  but we don't know how to change document size  like this    svg width " document width " height " document height "    so we added that documentsize option just for temporary use  i think fabric js should have that option  just don't know if it had or not  and how to use 
its is about the corners  the grips of objects  the cornercolor property already exists  cornerfill is new  i'd prefer to send the complete file to your team  so that you can merge the changes 
ys i want to show some overlay  loading gif  over canvas when script starts working   stops after render  i find after render function in example so i just want to confirm if there is any built in support for before render 
http   jsbin com uhenoki 24 edit html css js output no changes with latest version from repo 
you are correct  i disabled firebug and web developer tools and it worked  i'll try and do some additional research and post back if i find a reason for others  thanks for taking the time 
if you see code in fiddle  i call setcoords method  but coordinated doesn't update 
sure  no problem  http   jsfiddle net pfriedl fl64j  if you view on firefox  safari and even ie  you'll see that the canvas can easily apply a shadow with blur  but chrome does not  currently  i have to render the image to a hidden canvas  perform the "marching ants" algorithm to create a shape around the object  and apply a shadow to that   then copy that composite image to the visible canvas  the result is that the shadows look pretty jagged in chrome  this isn't a function or bug in fabric  but an actual bug in chrome that doesn't seem to have any chance of being fixed  however  i was wondering if there was a workaround in fabric that could render shadows in chrome much easier than i'm currently doing it  the version of chrome i'm using is 35 0 1916 114 m
hi  to use the image as background i need to load the full image  max 4gb  in a window browser and this is not a solution  i think is not a good idea to load the big image in the browser  in my case  i have a service that process the image and creates the tiles and the tiles are loaded into window browser using leaflet  http   leafletjs com  
thanks for replying  yes  i would do something like this  http   jsfiddle net 66bna 402    but with this plugins    leave the boxes outside resize the object  so that when the text is handled not be hidden by boxes 
hi juriy  thank you in advance for your work and your time    yep  i could see of the link from an android without problem  so i assume that the clip   method of javascript canvas is working properly on this device    i have been debugging my app and i realize that it is the clipto that it is not working  i can load  rotate and scale a fabric image without any problems  but i could not apply the method clipto to the canvas  i was using a svg path and i assume that this could be the problem  but i test the clipping with an ellipse and a rect whtout any positive results  i have been trying with differents versions of fabric js  cdn version and 1 4 12  with no luck    i will contonue working on this  if i find the problem i will let you know  thanks 
hi  asturur all of them  there are several custom fonts serving through my application  if it is a system installed font it works as expected  but when i made update it doesn't seem to work anymore there is default font rendered with small size  also canvas todataurl creates empty png in case of upgrade  i tried with different versions node 4  5 and 6 could not able to fix issue  but when in i downgrade to node 0 12 and fabric 1 6 0 rc 1 ├── canvas 1 1 6  nan 1 2 0  └── jsdom 1 1 0  contextify 0 1 15  to these versions it begins to operate correctly again  i guess this is related with versions conflict with node canvas could not able to figure out 
works fine with rectangles
i've put the kitchensink version and the version from the dist folder next to eachother and they are different  so i think that is the problem  i also checked my problem with the kitchensink version and now it works  so it might be a new bug or the dist folder isn't up to date 
yes     this works  thank you 
i use fabric js 1 4 13 version it cannot post in fiddle bcoz its little bit larger project what i do is i design some shapes on canvas and convert canvas to svg then save svg code in db after i retrieve the svg code it looks diferent only itext change their positions little bit 
i can't scale because in my software i add a background image to the paths and if they're scaled the image will look "pixellated"  i am essentially following your first advice from  the previous issue  https   github com kangax fabric js issues 2304  i've opened

i just searched the downloaded dev build of fabric for 'dblclick' and saw references to it  i saw that those come as part of gestures module  part of event js   so i assumed dblclick is supported

well i actually do need it for my project  and the weird thing is  i have an older revision of 1 6 0rc 1 saved which does exactly as you are saying  i am currently afk but when i get home ill post said version and also try to compare them  am 20 11 2015 6 45 nachm  schrieb "andrea bogazzi"  notifications github com

i tried to reproduce this error on this version of  rc 1  http   fabricjs com lib fabric js it works ok but on my project there was this version  https   raw githubusercontent com kangax fabric js master dist fabric js and it doesn't work well  maybe it's older build without recent fixes for retina 
this modified code will only turn the corners off while testing the istargettransparent  i don't think this code will affect re sizing the objects since it only turns it off on the object being drawn on to the contextcache  did i misunderstand your question

i want to dispose in two parts of my app  i've come up with a workaround for the first one  which from my examples are taken   but i still want to dispose in another part  the code for it looks something like that   this code is placed inside a redux's reducer  this allows me have a history of changes  and  generally  add some kind of immutability to a state of my canvas data  which is good in general sense   and this code is called a lot  my background is c#  so for dispose i expect a contract 'clear all resources'  though  i understand that in js there is no such contract  but because this expectation is quite common  if fabric has different contract  it probably should be mentioned in docs to avoid confusion  and i could be sure  that this code wouldn't result in some performance issues  related to leak of resources  if you're right on your assumption about the reason for this issue  i guess  i shouldn't face problems because of that  but if some resources actually leak  it might be a problem  i'm not sure about this one yet  but i think i can come up with another use case  where this double wrapping might cause problems by itself and it's a server side rendering  if i render my react app on a server with node and then render it on a client  i would have to have a new instance of fabric canvas  i cannot transfer it from server to client  so i would have to dispose the first one on a server and then instantiate a new one on a client   though  i'm not so familiar with server side rendering with react  so for now this is only my expectations  anyways  it would be nice at least to understand better what dispose does and what can i expect from it 
it's a bit hard as i'm using a lot of dependencies and my application has become a bit complex  but i found that all is ok with the "mouse down" event  the event is fired with left click one time  and is not fired with right click of wheel click  the problem still remain on the "mouse up" event  i'm sincerely sorry for the difficulties to reproduce this issue   
stop repropduce  cant understand why  hate ios   
that's surprising  it seems to be working fine now  did you actually fix that without releasing new version    edit    have you released the fixed code to npm  because the freshly installed npm version  1 6 3  still has these bugs 
hi  asturur thanks for your prompt reply  i did that but still facing the same issue  the object on canvas does zoom but also zooms the browser  also the url bar of the browser slides up  disappears  when touch and drag the object upwards and when we touch and drag the object downwards the url browser bar slides down  appears   it seems that the touch events on the canvas now conflict with the touch events of the browser 
hey   asturur thanks for your prompt reply  hope you are doing great man  in order to center align all the items present on the canvas  while maintaining the space between them    we first create a group of all the items present on the canvas var mygroup   new fabric group    var i   canvas getobjects   length  while  i      if canvas item i  isonscreen     mygroup addwithupdate canvas item i   setcoords          after the group is created we clear the canvas off of all the individual items canvas clear       and add the group on the canvas canvas add mygroup     center align group on canvas mygroup viewportcenter   setcoords      after the group is center aligned  the below code is used to take all items out of the group so that we can manipulate the items individually var edit_items   mygroup _objects  mygroup _restoreobjectsstate    canvas remove mygroup   for var i   0  i   edit_items length  i++    canvas add edit_items i      canvas renderall      so during this process  the layering order is lost and the items are stacked based on the order they were added on the canvas and not based on the layers we created by bringing items forward and sending backward 
the problem is still occurring after hitting enter    b_cursors2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16231411 18273134 141fad90 743c 11e6 9f86 6e2731ce78d3 png 
sorry the _onresize  function in fabric js  all the changes in this file   i also had to send an initial resize when i setup the canvas initially and created the fabric object   this canvas   new fabric canvas this htmlid   containerclass  this htmlid  enableretinascaling  true       settimeout         this canvas _onresize       0    
 asturur i used  todatalessjson    to get that json string
you're advising to change all image objects to rectangles with image fill  that will disable image effects   
yes you are right i should have mentionned that i build fabric within electron 1 4 3 which uses node 6 5 0 and here is the contextify build error 
try https   jsfiddle net b8ctv990 
text fill is set to #cd3333  there is no correct and wrong  the first one is what i see in the canvas  the rgb for that is 205 51 51  the second one is the actual png  generated with node canvas  if i open both images in photoshop  colors match  if i use the preview and digital color meter tool from osx then both colors don't match 
hi  asturur  i haven't measured it or anything  but it feels normal  the image is generated in a "normal" time  so to me is pretty much ok  i will create the pr 
i guess it must be happening because of some configuration i have  i was just asking in case someone had an idea  the code is pretty standard  create canvas and add text to canvas  the thing is that the previous version i was using  2 3 6  doesn't have the problem  thanks 
 asturur checked  looks like all working good now 
this is how our copy paste now looks  before we added the clonedeep functions  we found that the  props  object that we add to each of our fabric objects was just a reference to wherever we cloned from  so when we would edit a value for one  it would change that value for all of them 
hi asrutur  http   jsfiddle net vijaygurjar yjg7j5lh 1  in this example when object selection box goes outside canvas then selection box border set to red  but i need when text box content goes to outside canvas then selection border set to red  rather then selection box i need warning on text content in rotation case also  
i only need to change the color of characters in the middle of the string  and itext seems to be the only thing that can handle that  which is nice  but the kerning goes off sketch and css can both handle this  if thats what you asked

ah sorry  seems to work in safari only  don't know why  what you see in canvas   img width "261" alt "screen shot 2017 08 16 at 17 24 50" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 8090162 29371158 dc1bb0e4 82a7 11e7 9d66 71867d17284a png"  what you see as svg   img width "292" alt "screen shot 2017 08 16 at 17 24 43" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 8090162 29371203 01821d0a 82a8 11e7 8399 c6d72734f4e0 png" 
that's correct here too now  i don't understand    but i guess we can close it  i think something related to e gpu stuff on osx again 
 utiq i have no idea for that 
nothing is shifted in the example above  the dog is just in the 0  0  so why do you need these 150 shiftings both on image and on group element 
that's the problem   if i only have the serialized json  i do not have the saved pixel size  because it is not included  fortunately  i have do a workaround  because i have the saved pixel size in the serialized svg  i am lucky that i thought "i might need this as an svg  too"  so i saved it both ways 
hi asturur  i have used the latest fabric 1 7 22 and created a fiddle as well  would you please check and let me what i am doing wrong  https   jsfiddle net skvav5th 8 
i understand that  but here is a scenario  my application has two components  one is a canvas itself  and another is kind of attributes position panel where you can change the left of an element  the left number comes from backend and this is an actual number which should be represented in the attributes panel  so  to get the left i'm using   this getleft     function which returns a left based on its originx  if its set to center  which i do need to be able to rotate an element based on center   then we get  like you say  150 5 by 200 5  but take a look  technically it's a center  not left    so in my scenario  the input will display a value of 150 5  not 100 and to make it right i'll need to substruct a half on a width  and then add half of the width later     so  what i think should be the correct way is to have either an object of coordinates or something like that  where left is a left  a center is a center etc despite their origins or to change the logic of the   getleft   function and get the actual left  make sense  any thoughts  tnx
first of all thanks a lott  that repo  changedpi  really worked  not printed yet    better quality in comparison from imagick  '_nothing else should change  not file size  image data  no image pixel dimenions _' i can't say if imagick is processing something  '_upscaling with the dataurl is still the best option for me_' yes  seen your answers and others for the suggestion of multiplier value in  dataurl   as i said at this stage we can't update  because we don't know what may break  but your library has really helped  thanks again  btw i am guessing the repo you have shared for dpi would be separate one or any chance to include code in fabric in later versions  and yes for cmyk colours options  thanks  asturur for help
please take a look at the live example  1  on ie11  go to https   meet stage greenjobinterview net join livemeeting id 103514 and add any name to enter the room  2  click on the second icon from left above 'meeting information' to open whiteboard  3  hit 'full screen' option from tool bar 4  hit 'text' option from tool bar  dummy text object will be added to canvas  5  try editing the text by using 'backspace' or 'delete' key from keyboard  actual behavior  our custom method to delete selected object is called instead of fabric js onkeyup   method  ideally  this method should not be called as the focus is inside hidden text area  however  if you exit full screen mode and do the same  it calls fabric js onkeyup   method  imo  there is no event binding occuring on ie11 full screen mode when we select the text and inithiddentextarea   method is called  note  the above behavior works fine on chrome and firefox browsers  both small and full screen mode 
yes  i have checked they work pretty well in your demos  this is a part of my js

i finally found  after 5 weeks  the source of the problem  if anyone ever stumbles upon this problem  make sure than you are not loading these images somewhere else in your page  basically  i was displaying a list of all added images  with previews  my browser fetched these ones before  resulting in conflicts between the versions of these images  the images in the list were loaded first  and therefore cached  and this cached version was probably used by fabric  but since they did not have the same origin  this would eventually raise a cors issue  so  to solve this  i created a helper that modify the url of these images  simply adding a key at the end  so that it would always fetch a non cached version of it 
i have created fiddle with example  http   jsfiddle net srchaudharys02 da7sp 824  i have fixed with change in fabricjs method   but will be better if you suggest a way  if you want then i will share my fix  thanks

 asturur firefox 59  did not try on other browsers  i bypassed the error by resizing the images to 2048px if they are bigger  with the resize filter   before applying the grayscale filter  although it's no issue for me  because i don't really need images   2048px wide   it's a hacky solution 
attached are the generated files coming from 1 7 and 2 2 respectively  changed  svg suffix to  txt due to github limits for attaching files  i gathered some additional information in the meantime   irritating because the problem seems to flap  meaning it does not always occur  but can be reproduced in all major browsers for long runs  tens of production runs   then all of a sudden the problem vanishes in one browser  what i also find strange is the fact that the closing quote is usually adjacent to the last character with no intervening space  but not in the case of the path    path d "m     " style "   " transform "translate 276 387 71  "    i would expect this to look like   path d "m     " style "   " transform "translate 276 387 71 "    one might speculate that the code starts to produce a new option when the erroneous pattern is present  but then terminates without emitting the closing quote  i currently have a very crude fix in place on the server by simply replacing  svg   svg replace '""  '  '"  '   the deadly pattern  mahalo for looking into this   ig 1 7 txt  https   github com kangax fabric js files 1818171 ig 1 7 txt   ig 2 2 txt  https   github com kangax fabric js files 1818172 ig 2 2 txt

okay  but how do you test fabric js  are you using any tool or doing it manually 
 asturur thanks for the speedy reply  yeah  i think this is mainly down to node canvas so sorry for posting here  does fabric now support canvas prebuilt  that might be the solution    it runs fine locally with the required libraries  but trying to build and host it to the cloud as a web app is proving difficult  thanks again

it's not good smoother experience when editing text on 'itext' widget directly  so i want to popup a input when click itext  and set new text into 'itext' when finish input，at this time i want to know itext's text is changed for doing something
all or specific events that are fired after canvas is loaded from json  eg  object changed  asturur
 asturur it's something like this   so   body  is  buffer   is there any api in in fabric that works with buffers   fromobject  doesn't really do the job
ok  i've been investigating the after render event but still having problems  maybe if i explain exactly what i'm trying to do  someone could suggest an approach  i have an app that allows a user to apply styles to words in a textbox  and it works well  except when the font size is increased  my code adds the textbox to the canvas  then checks its height and if the height exceeds the current canvas height  it resizes the canvas to fit the text  this works well normally  but if the user has increased the font size of a word  or words   the bounding rectangle of the overall textbox does not reflect the added size until after the rendering is complete  so i was hoping to be able to call this resizing function after all rendering is done  then re render the canvas to fit the new textbox height  the problem with using the after render event to do this is that i can't call renderall   from within that event or it goes into an infinite loop and exhausts the call stack  so this doesn't seem to be a workable solution  unless there's some way to re render the canvas from within that event  if this description is clear  can anyone suggest a method to achieve this 
hi  unfortunately i cant share the code or replicate it exactly on fiddle or codepen since this is an internal company work  but the brush that i was using is a custom square brush when taking in coordinate i have use parseint so it cant be floating point issue  the image from canvas is convert to array buffer using getimagedata and was used to write out to the file  even with the usage of pencil brush this issue still exists  on tue  apr 21  2020 at 10 45 pm andrea bogazzi  notifications github com  wrote

no    you can check it by testing with this fiddle http   fiddle tinymce com ccfaab 6

i am using the latest release v4 5 1 
it can't be reproduced at fiddle tinymce com  it must be an integration issue with umbraco  how should i proceed  thanks
by using the  inline  true  option as shown above
unlukliy i can't  i've already tried to set up a fiddle with my code  http   fiddle tinymce com zbfaab   but there my tinymce init   works properly  so i don't know what hurts the editor  the page which contains the editor has several other script  maybe some of those may cause this issue  but i don't know which could be  because the browser console does not show any error  if you are interested in solving this weird behavior  i can set up a page in my application where all the scripts are loaded and give you the access  i'm really sorry  but for now i was forced to use a different wysiwyg editor 
hi mattias  sure  i'm using image plugin  v4 x  not sure what value "x" has  the project i'm using it lacks documentation  and i'm relatively new on it  but i added the minified version of the plugin  maybe it helps  cheers  adrian 2016 12 07 12 41 gmt+02 00 mattias  notifications github com

the event would be used as a workaround to further edit the dialog if the customization options from tinymce are not as robust as needed for a specific project  for example  if someone wants to add an extra tab to the help screen on the fly  i understand  though  that the event is not entirely necessary

hi  jayarjo lets say my template has the following div   div style "background color black"   it loads and is displayed without any issue when tinymce starts  and if i edit that div in the editor  tinymce adds the new styles like this   data mce style "padding 5px "  resulting in the following div   div style "background color black" data mce style "padding 5px "   but when i open the code pluging  tinymce replaces the "style" content with the "data mce style" content  causing the original style to be lost  edit  fiddle http   fiddle tinymce com qbgaab 2 just open and close the source code tool and the styles are lost

well we have large forms in our system and that is a requirement  and even field is a textarea which is bound with tinymce  and we want the text to be formatted and have the capacity to show bold   italic and even underlined text  so we opted for tinymce  it works great for small forms  no complains there but when the instance of the tinymce in the form size go higher  it takes significantly longer to load and inb some cases completely breaks the js  my question is  is there a way to just load the tinymce library once and then attach the intance to the textarea rather than loading the library for every textarea 
thanks for the reply  i'm using tinymce v5 2 0  but  lnewson is correct that this seems to be related to the legacy mobile theme  i must have overlooked that it was deprecated  i'll be switching to the silver theme  which by the looks of it will have none of these problems  thanks to the horizontal scrolling toolbar and popout color picker  
hi  sorry about that but when i was actually writing that minimal js without sensitive data i actually found out what the issue was  th was too big for the world map to fit  i've reduced it to 0 2 and now it's displaying correctly  what i think the issue was is that i have markers in north america and australia which are basically opposite to one another  and the padding around these 2 was bigger than the world map so it displayed several maps instead of one  thanks anyways    leaflet map bounds  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 11183925 10180459 c09b486c 6750 11e5 9175 c83315797d66 png

for game developing it need  if it does not support by leaflet could you please tell me in which side to look in the code to add this feature  i wiil do the same as you did with repeating horizontally  but it not easy find in the code the right plase  thanks 
 danzel what exactly would you need to see in the code  i am limited by my employer to expose too much of the code base  so if you are looking for a particular piece of code  then i can maybe supply it  as far as i can tell you  i have the map layer within a jquery ui accordion that is initially closed at page load  komzpa informed me that hidden layers that contain a map layer  cannot properly acquire map size or something along those lines  so he provided me with his workaround  if i remove the fitbounds   call from my code sample that i provided  the map works properly  but i need the map to center and zoom according to the bounds i specify  and in a hidden layer that's not particularly working 
sorry  i'm not familiar with this stuff either  i can only rely on the uppod flash player plugin and mapsmarker plugin developers guidelines and advice  but let alone the uppod – this problem persists if i embed the youtube code  
that looks very promising  i will check it out tomorrow since i don't have the laptop with me right now 
it's chrome 19  which i'm not sure you even support  works fine in firefox alpha and ie 10  so this may be close able actually 
just tested ll 0 4 5 and it behaves the same way 
updated from 0 4 5 to master branch end now everything seems fine  if you need i can make special page with different versions of leaflet 
i am using a regular mouse with a click ey scroll wheel   razer orochi   each click consistently zooms three levels in or out  note that the same behavior is seen in safari as well  in the os settings for mouse  the scroll speed is set at 3 ticks  but changing this does not seem to affect the problem either way 
ok  it was more complicated than i thought  but this passes for me in firefox and fails in webkit browsers  http   jsfiddle net yxppj 10 
just found the issue #1281  i think they are related 
here is the jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net r4cj9  it shows the bug  the latlng is off by 6 in the jsfiddle example  if you check in firefox you see the correct values 
i tend to expect epsg 4326 coordinates to fall in the range     180  90     180   90     sorry for not being clear  what i am seeing is that they come out further north  south  east and west  so i just added some additional code to check things 
of course  with leaflet   http   jsfiddle net rz6pk  with openlayers   http   jsfiddle net pmtmb 2  thanks 
 danzel the new point is very close ti the old point   roughly 24 blocks or so   mourner i'll try it with master and do a little more research into it  thanks for being so responsive 
the projection distortion caused by the mercator projection should be much less than the scale error  e g  look at this screenshot   scale_mercator  https   f cloud github com assets 2156335 1071340 4e812b24 1474 11e3 88c6 1ab3d5090974 png  if you pan around the map in the area it's impossible to make the scale change enough to make it fit the landscape there

i already used master branch  on the stable branch the map doesn't appear all together  previously i was using this d7bf010f0b8e30e291ed8193fcc52d7f8fe118fd commit 
i back up  it is not reproducible for myself  i guess i accidentally viewed the page on another browser zoom level  which reproducable shows the effect on chrome on some levels  still strange  as the text is still true type rendered  but this is chrome's fault then 
 perliedman yes  i do not find the same issue in chrome  but i tried to use openlayers instead of leaflet in firefox  and it seems that firefox use less memory and cpu than that of when using leaflet  http   jsfiddle net dljup 1  so i think this may caused by the event rather than the image loading 
http   jsfiddle net 7wkkz  it happens when you call the redraw function  at the beginning only 6 messages are logged in the console  when you click on the map  and the redraw function is called   12 messages are logged in the console 
can reproduce on latest leaflet 0 8 dev  branch master  commit c5091ee  code 
here is the jsfiddle   http   jsfiddle net xelloss s6vnm  there is no cdn for leaflet 0 8 dev so i put all the source in it  for testing     ff   work fine   chrome   work fine   ie 10   not working   ie 11   work fine hope this help 
yes  i want to disable the buttons dynamically so they are unclickable whilst results are produced and then re enable them again once the results have been shown 
wait a few seconds and later click on the zoom control  after you try to click in zoom again and the zoom control don't work
i will link it later  maybe tomorrow   im a bit busy today   
i do  but i'm not sure how the documentation is generated  i assume it is   just add the question mark in the code's comment itself  i'm starting a migration to version 1 0 and i'm using typescript so every issue with the documentation is creating a compilation error on my side  at least for the functions i use   same question for  map setzoom    
i've read the readme file of the project and i'm not 100  sure it covers my needs  what i want to do is create a server that can server tiles in any zoom level  not just integers  and present them on a map  for example when a user is at latlng  0 0  and sets zoom to 10 111 i want leaflet to call the server for tiles at address  www mysite com tiles 10 111 0 0 png  the server on the other had will either generate the tile on the fly or serve from local cache  probably a local folder called 10 111 0 and a file called 0 png  but that's implementation details   so the projection is done on the server side and not on the client side  does it make more sense now 
i just test this codes with master  it seems also works fine 
but without that vehicle marker icon geofences circle display about max zoom  if inside geofances circle marker is there that time i click on marker  i set if click on marker it will display max zoom map with icon with popup details about icon and in geofances circle   geofences disappears only marker and popup display  geofance display maxzoom  18 but without vehicle marker  empty circle    i am not using svg circle i cant set in jsfiddle  without click zoom level  4 if click on the marker zooming level 18 
the leaflet example works fine if i load it from the url in a mobile browser  but in my case  i have it integrated it in a cordova mobile app  using ionic framework   i am not sure how i could do a js fiddle for it  i am using a galaxy nexus phone with android v 4 3  a similar problem is mentioned in #733 where the examples are fine when loaded from a mobile browser 
uhh  that might be an issue  i will look into the possibility  but i can not promise you any definite answers before monday  it is already the last workday of the week here  and now comes a weekend

as far as i'm understanding the pictures of the issue #3814 right  it also happens in chrome on android and safari on ios  this issue here does only appear in the native lg g4 browser  which should be chrome 38 but maybe has some modifications from lg   it works flawlessly on the current available chrome browser for android  however the symptoms sound similar  although this issue here is very simple to reproduce  it does exactly take one gesture or one zoom button press   to be honest i'm not absolutely sure whether this is a duplicate or not  but we had never observed such issues on chrome and safari  the g4 and its native browser is the first device  i will try to investigate the issue and will post it here  if i will find something 
this should be the link  https   playground leaflet rhcloud com joh edit html output edit  hover over the 10  a polygon apears  but on mouse out it is not removed  even duplicated with multiple mouse overs  
i actually first noticed it while trying to integrate the wfs t plugin from flexberry into the app  i can certainly add that to the playground if you like  however  it still seems like the issue is that this _convertlatlngs can return nothing which would make the following line   if  hole 0  equals hole hole length 1      fail because hole is then undefined

thanks for your suggestions  when i started i didn't know much about this kind of stuff  actually i don't know so well now either  i simply followed two blogs post telling me how to make the tiles out my big picture representing the game map and then used tms true because with that everything was working fine  so back to the present   i'm more than happy to adapt and do as you said  the problem is that i couldn't make it work they way it should be  when i tried to make the y flip thing leaflet was searching for images with nan as y  by the way do i have to make the tiles again or at least organize hem differently in the folders if i switch tms to false

seems to have been fixed with the new versions of chrome  thanks 
in the top right corner  there is an input with "change value" text  there is a  change  event attached to it  and the callback function will remove the map  then recreate it  in order to dispatch the event  after you change the value  you'll have to click elsewhere in the page   change the value once  1  if you click below the map  the event is dispatched   everything works as expected  the first map is removed  then recreated  don't care with misorder of tiles    change the value again  1  if you click on the map  the  change  event is dispatched as well  but the map that is recreated no longer have events  you can't pan the map anymore 
first a small correction  wcag does not need title and alt attributes  there are several techniques to pass wcag validation  but i'll give you an example  go to  http   leafletjs com  on the first page there is a map with a pin and a small "popup" window  in the upper right corner there is a close button "x"  to make that close button wcag compliant you'd need to add  something like  a aria label attribute  or title attribute   lets say that aria label "close" will be good enough for this  that text string can be added to the code in two ways  hard coded or via a variabel defined in a language js file  if you have a multi language site you'd want to have the option to have german  swedish or  any other language of choice   something like this example  gettranslatedstring "leaflet close button"  "en uk"  or gettranslatedstring "leaflet close button"  leaflet lang   leaflet lang being global and easily changeable on the fly  if a user changes language  if work with "accessibility improvements #3210" is going to be done  this would be an perfect opportunity to implement multi language support as well

i'm very sorry  the ui left js is 2 0 0 version and leaflet is 1 0 1  in my humble opinion  i think that´s may be a leaflet issue because the function acepted a wrong type data  i'm not sure what happened  but i could analyze that everything happens when it goes through the initialization function of the layer  lines 1268 1270  and this happends when i use array prototype     angular collections some times was like arrays and some times like as objects  it's very probably there a messy with that  i´m very sorry not be more helpful

http   jsfiddle net zkc5m 400 
hi ivan  that is a bit difficult  because for that you need to have also webtrees  or do you want to test it in webtrees  in a plain environment there is no problem 
i can reproduce it in windows and ubuntu too  maybe you do something wrong  click using mouse  not in the marker  and then press enter key  
i was updating from  7 and this was a difference  looking at the code referenced  i cant see where  map wraplatlngbounds bounds   would be modifying the passed in bounds object so if the wrapped bounds aren't being returned  why is that function being called  to me it just seemed like a simple typo vs an intentional change   worldcopyjump  does work  but just felt too jumpy and as i said  the behavior in  7 was different 
indeed  with "height  100 " the contributions are visible  so it's not a leaflet bug   i'm sorry for the mistake  
yes  good way to to eliminate reasons for the error  what could it possibly be though  the same code runs on chrome and edge 
i'm not saying this is a bug  but i can't find what causes tiles to load in the source  i'm looking to make my iframe work with all sorts of sites and clearly i'm not simulating the environment correctly

i proposed a patch and #6193 has now been fixed with https   github com leaflet extras leaflet providers commit 975977fe0146b4c84ecb861c2d848aa01ef254aa but there there is an issue with l browser retina since my screen is not retina and retina tiles should never have been requested  as the documentation states it  l browser retina is supposed to reflect a high resolution "retina" screen but amof it doesnt   it only reflects when the browser display zoom   100   i suggest to reopen this issue did you try the reproduce steps  
done #6200
i write that test in project vuejs + leaflet + jest  any tips for me 
we wanted to work with a map which was initialized by a wordpress plugin  code we can't edit  inside a closure  nowadays  due to jquery and co  almost everything is thanksfully done in closures   in such a situation  there is no way to access the leaflet object

 jaykrell we have already been using etw in   dottrace   profiler  for example we use   dotnetruntime   etw provider to profile  net applications  this provider gives us managed symbol information  mappings from native addresses to managed items so we are able to resolve native etw stacks later  the important point here is that we don't need pdb to resolve managed symbols  we get all the necessary information from etw  so to employ etw in mono profiler we need mono to give us native managed mappings like dotnetruntime provider does  and we wouldn't like to require symbol files like pdb  moreover etw is not cross platform tool  so it would be pretty odd to use mono profiler api with sampling and stack walker in linux or mac and in contrast etw with native managed resolving functionality in windows  it brings us to a number of almost different mono profilers  imho it is not indication of good profiling api

our user's project is getting a typeload exception on that enum  but i'd prefer we had the api surface of system diagnostics performancedata available and throwing notimplementedexception than missing completely in the case users include other libraries built with  netfw that may include these types 
jonathan pryor identified an interesting point about this issue  part of the  documented behavior of  system io file copy     https   docs microsoft com dotnet api system io file copy view netstandard 2 1  is  the documentation does not specifically mention whether the copied file also retains the permissions  mode  or access control list of the original file  but it seems like a potentially valid design choice for  file copy    to set the destination file to have the same read  write  and execute permission mode bits as the original file  if the team agrees that  file copy    and  file move    should fail in cases where they cannot set the permission bits on the destination file  then it might be acceptable to close this issue as an intentional breaking change  the recommendation for android developers would then be to use another option like  file readallbytes    plus  file writeallbytes    to copy or move files to destinations on external storage  ### possible changes to  systemnative_copyfile    to brainstorm about possible changes to  systemnative_copyfile    that  might  be interesting to consider  1  call  fstat_    on  outfd   and skip the call to  fchmod    if the resulting  st_mode  field for  outfd  already has the same   s_irwxu   s_irwxg   s_irwxo   bits as the  st_mode  field obtained for  infd   that is  something roughly like     details

 marek safar no  i have nothing more  it's an issue that got moved across repos    but i asked for a test case  from the original reporter    rubo can you provide a test case   that line you mentioned might help  to figure it out  but it could be an issue only when other options are enabled

thank you for your useful informations   lewurm i'll try 5 18 this night   equiclouds that's what i planned to do next  disabling swap file  the situation went worse  so i thought the same idea as you mentioned   but there were no time to try it last night     anyway  i'll report soon 
2  sounds good to me  if we don't find other solution  couldn't we try to generate the branch islands ourselves  how do they look  wouldn't they also introduce relocations 
ah  ok  i corrected it above  thank you  yes     no  but i'm not certain i'm doing it correctly  i might need a little hand holding here  i'm afraid not  it's closed source  hence the warnings above with the fear that this might be marked "can't reproduce"

hi  vargaz  thanks for answering     this' my script for building 
hi  thank you for your response  i am surprised because i just typed   sudo apt get install mono complete so where is my problem please   regards  raphaël ⁣télécharger typeapp pour android ​ le 25 nov  2019 16 05  à 16 05  jo shields  notifications github com  a écrit 
this while loop actually simulated a hardware trigger  it was slow  and i gave it 5ms just wanted to enfast the process  i tried to set to 500ms  it was just growing slow  it didn't make any difference 
the errors are as below   i am using mono as runtime  and i am building the source files as well of whole components  that include mono's source   where can i download this source rpm so that i can include into my source packages together 
hi  lambdageek  thanks for the prompt response and forgive me for the grumpy tone of my initial post  it's been one of those weeks  my sincere apologies  mac os is version 10 14 6 i let the pkg automatically open on download using the  installer   i run an unprivileged account and let the system prompt to nudge me for admin rights during the install  i haven't used mono in  i don't know  10+ years   glad to see it's going strong  btw   the likelyhood it's on this laptop prior to today is low  but i suppose it's possible  there is only 6 8 0  and current  obviously  in   library frameworks mono framework versions  though  i have installed  for the first time  and opened visual studio code today too  i don't know if that's related  i just removed the framework and paths d and reinstalled the same way   anything else i can do  just let me know  regards  iain

 dict copy    looks good  the copy docs mention you can use it  http   docs python org library copy html   thanks for the quick fix 
i got the same error as before  here are my exact values 
django raises "alreadyregistered" exception on all models  it's triggered by "admin autodiscover  " in settings py  might be weird  but i see the whole thing in a browser  
mainly deployment speed  after i've read  this  http   lucumr pocoo org 2012 6 22 hate hate hate everywhere    i've changed our deplyoment  1  generate   egg s for every dependency 2  put them into an "eggbasket"  i e  on a http server 3  use  easy_install  to generate a  virtualenv  from scratch  since the first step only needs to run once a dependency has changed  the third step is vastly faster than with  pip install  r requirements txt   in our case  with many dependencies and especially with compiled dependencies  a virtual environment is now created in matter of seconds instead of minutes  i'm going to check up on  easy_install   maybe i can find a simple solution 
my mistake  i reached incorrect conclusions  i tried running celery as both  celeryd and django celery method  manage py celery   everything from django environment seems to be running fine  update  found the reason  i was running sentry as a semi separate environment  my django app  and therefore celery environment as well  was not using sentry web urls  only sentry as an installed app  resolved this by adding   r' sentry '  include 'sentry web urls'    to celery and django urlpatterns 
i ran sentry upgrade  and it reported "nothing to migrate"  the error is actually logged  so maybe the client  raven  is logging the same message twice  after getting the first error  client tries to log the returned "internal server error" and gets another error  i am using default sqllite and built in web server 
oh  sorry for the noise  it was my fault       i've just read the note about sentry_ prefix in the docs http   sentry readthedocs org en latest config index html
yes it is in the environment
maybe    the only new dependancy is python instagram which does require simplejson with  install_requires  "simplejson" "httplib2"  so this must be installing the latest simplejson  this is in my requirements txt before sentry     should i change the order 
i think i rushed a little  the zip safe issue was real and it fixed a part of the problems  but not the ones that were bothering me  everything worked until i realized i was using the default config and not the one that i've configured and backed up  if a switch to that config the problem reappears  when i was running  sentry help  i was seeing only the default django commands  i started then to change configuration by configuration end encountered issues with both caches and buffer configurations as follows    when caches is enabled sentry is not loading for some reason the installed django apps  so  sentry help  would only display the default django commands   when buffer   configuration section is enabled  sentry start  is throwing the following stack trace  https   gist github com 4554410 these are not urgent issues  as i can live without caching and buffering in development  but i thinks this is a big issue for production deployments 
 markstory  it's via sentry io

thanks  dcramer  mattrobenolt for getting back  we're running    cassandra 2 0 9   cassandra driver 2 1 2  on sentry box    casscache  0 1 1  on sentry box  as i'd already set  i am able to  get  and  set  from the cassandra cluster from  manage py shell  interface of sentry  but not from celery workers    and  there's no ports blocked by firewall within our private network 
notification prefix  ' sentry ' sentry conf py   on default config i have a similar problem 
is it normal workers situation 
since the npm is running with   q   i know is running by inspecting the pstree and netstat  i'll try to reproduce it in my box that almost the same as the server and report back

here is my config 
 mattrobenolt   redis_version 2 8 4  and for redis py i believe  2 10 3   got that for  pip show redis   not sure how to see the version else  innocent   
it does look like that progresses me past the point  then i'm on to an error message about redis  which is covered in the installation section  thanks for the fast reply 
putting   verify_ssl 0  at the end fixed it  but doesn't explain why it's having issues when it worked fine with the 7 x version of sentry  only when i upgraded to the current git master version 
yes  sentry juan cloud  etc sentry  pip freeze django  1 9 importlib  1 0 3 wheel  0 24 0
my other instance works fine with gevent  though i can probably run without it   
 mattrobenolt i try to  make build  in setry docs 
i did install from pypi using the  pip install  command 
it seems to have to do with the requests being made over http instead of https   blocked  the page at https   sentry wokcraft com manage queue  was not allowed to display insecure content from http   sentry wokcraft com api 0 internal stats  since 1456329005 946 resolution 10s key jobs all started  the 'root url' is configured for https  sidenote  getting the following deprication error as well  warning  react render is deprecated  please use reactdom render from require 'react dom'  instead 
no  i didn't delete any files  it affects both old and new releases with uploaded sourcefiles 
it does for me  try a refresh with the network panel open  also would be good to have on https   cdn ravenjs com 3 9 1 raven min js
hey  mattrobenolt here is the output from  docker run  it   rm  e sentry_secret_key 'my key'   link sentry postgres postgres   link sentry redis redis sentry upgrade  syncing    creating tables     creating table django_admin_log creating table auth_permission creating table auth_group_permissions creating table auth_group creating table django_content_type creating table django_session creating table django_site creating table south_migrationhistory installing custom sql     installing indexes     installed 0 object s  from 0 fixture s  synced  not synced  use migrations     sentry   sentry nodestore   sentry search   social_auth  use   manage py migrate to migrate these  running migrations for sentry    migrating forwards to 0268_fill_environment 
wow  this is what i call fast reply  thanks for that   maxbittker hmm might have been for more then a month but i only noticed now  so nevermind the sudden part   mattrobenolt i just reviewed my deploy process and i made a change that is uploading to sentry after the gzip  so that's the problem  thanks guys 
 mattrobenolt the title of issue is the error message 
thank you all for your swift reaction  that's a great user experience   dcramer thank you for this quick report  but these are wrong suggestions  as i wrote  even older release are not working  when i invoke an error in the older release  where source mapping worked  sentry receives a new event  does not pair it with it's older counterpart  and outputs an error which says that it could not locate the source files  yes it does not work after an update  i'll try to find out which version we had before but it was the one "before the redesign"   except sentry version  nothing has changed  of course i tried all the "typical" problems i found around on the internet    sure names are correct  not changed across all the sentry versions we've used   is this form enough     snimek obrazovky 2017 01 03 v 19 26 04  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4154045 21618309 96fdef04 d1ea 11e6 88c4 0e42b2d90947 png 
'postgres'      as long as there is no other db option  pgsql stuff can stay in the main list  and as you noticed  the extra name must stay for not breaking stuff out there 
i failed to get a perfect screenshot  but this is how it occurs in edge 14    screenshot from 2017 04 24 17 52 45  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12389383 25334944 ca9777ac 292b 11e7 8b61 a7bdc4ce8c95 png  turns out this is rather #3542  which is the behavior of  csp 1 0  https   www w3 org tr 2012 cr csp 20121115 #sample violation report  
ah  done

no i do not have   id  in logs    i removed personnal ids from logs  see https   developer mozilla org en us docs web http headers access control allow credentials documentation about this header  this is mandatory cors header if request is containing authentication headers or just cookies  as raven js request is containing cookies  without this header the response content is blocked by my firefox browser 
 mrmitew not sure  this will be picked up by _product_ and prioritized  could take a bit since there's a lot in the backlog generally  the tags indicate this could be a easy first contribution tough  if you'd like to give it a try

hi  with 9 1 2 the error is still there on java projects    python projects work with this query
looking at the code of  metrics incr  and  metrics timing   https   github com getsentry sentry blob d292fd4680274bf638ffb73fa5584593bd0642f7 src sentry metrics statsd py https   github com getsentry sentry blob 8be33e3baa990442dcfc836473c3c8d81ecfe7ec src sentry utils metrics py#l89 i'm still unsure which metrics are pushed to statsd  looking at the metrics that telegraf collects it looks like the integration doesn't work  as i don't see any metrics that has  sentry  in its name 
sorry  i rechecked  i see it truncate at 8000 chars like you said  is there any way to increase this limit number 
  cd onpremise   docker volume create   name sentry data    docker volume create   name sentry postgres   cp  n  env example  env   docker compose build   docker compose run   rm web config generate secret key   vim  env   docker compose run   rm web upgrade   docker compose up  d   docker compose ps i did it in this order  but i still made a mistake
i have logged in as my devops organization owner  it doesn't let me add the integration still  we are using federation and it is a work email that comes from azure active directory  ### my devops organization owner   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 33850520 62954828 ab2b9080 bdb5 11e9 9d2f af4968817172 png  ### my sentry user   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 33850520 62954883 c1395100 bdb5 11e9 9d9c eb9acf5e6544 png  ### still get the same error   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 33850520 62954937 d3b38a80 bdb5 11e9 90a0 3ef0f779dac8 png 
as i understand the process is in public preview and should be available to anyone  but it is only the default process for new projects created in the central us region based on what i read  here  https   docs microsoft com en us azure devops release notes 2019 sprint 146 update#simplify the organization of your work using the basic process   when you create a new project press 'advanced' and select 'basic' in the 'work item process' dropdown 
hi  yes  but there was no   section showing the wrapping chain  it is working in a sense that it registers the error in sentry  however i can't follow error wrapping in the source code 
if i don't modify any options and save it's ok  but if i modify an option  save the option and save the job then it happens  was scratching my head for a while  i had thought it was the new markdown text i was putting in  stripping it out had no effect then i spotted the numerous "amp " in the options url  i really should of spotted it sooner

actually this is an issue while saving the workflow definition  plugin simply executes command remotely using a custom pipe mechanism to forward passwords  not really relevant to this context   say i want to save these lines in step definition  as directly entered in textbox  do_stuff_0 echo  e "do_stuff_1 do_stuff_2" do_stuff_3 exported job definition looks like this   note there's no  m after commands other than echo  not sure quotes have an implication for it  plugin does what is exactly ordered  flushes content as is  with  ms  hence fails when flushed content is executed  i know this is not the best practice to follow  but most of our workflows run this way atm  any insights to where fix might be would also be quite helpful  i browsed grails content but it's not clear where step content is serialized  with  ms   thanks

yes  but it seems to be certain steps  i'm wondering if it's triggered by a certain string  it seems to be when capturing the output of my startserver and closeserver scripts  which haven't changed since rd 2 4 2 which was fine with them  these are  bin csh scripts  bash scripts don't seem to be having the same problem  some shell interaction

of course  some times we might scan for machines for particular file process attribute etc   and for those that failed because either winrm was not configured or powershell script simply failed  or the file process was not found  etc   but the script did succeeded on the some we would love to zoom in on the passed machines and run additional other scripts to save time without hitting all the other failed machines  hope that makes sense

thanks for pointing me in that direction  this problem was caused by a thoroughly corrupted  jaas auth conf  due to a botched git merge conflict resolution  so  no actual bug with auth  just that the error message doesn't mention the problematic file

well i using rundeck for more than 1 year already the only issue is in my new company i just get the taste of enterprise you know workflow  vmware inventory   slack notifications etc something that on opensource doesn't exist at all that would be great to have all the features as opensource and more features that enterprise and just pay per support no per features  just look like fedora and rhel   fedora is the opensource of rhel have same features of rhel but fedora is going more advance in software that rhel and redhat offer subscription for support if you don't want to buy you can also use centos that is 1 1 rhel clone means they are really opensource software and that is the reason why they are great also  as you said rundeck is great product and the people putting the effort on it is great but great would be have full product that we can use and when we have problem any company is much comfortable to buy the support

here's the particular place where vouch generates multi value headers for claims from the oauth provider   https   github com vouch vouch proxy blob master handlers handlers go#l216 here's some references from the http 1 1 spec for message syntax  https   tools ietf org html rfc7230#section 3 2 2 https   tools ietf org html rfc7230#section 3 2 6 so quoting field values seems valid  which seems sensible given you could have a comma in your group name   though vouch is on the very liberal side  quoting everything regardless of whether its necessary  and doesn't handle escaping as far as i can see

hi  ltamaster i ended up switching back to jsch because ed25519 keys aren't currently working with openssh either  https   github com rundeck rundeck issues 4954#issuecomment 502721987   that was the main reason for the switch  i did try the  r flag but that caused issues with the way paths and wild cards were handled in certain file copy jobs  sorry i don't have more info to offer atm  all my projects are using jsch now  best
adding that resolved the file copy issue  thanks  odd that the file copy and run remote command steps aren't affected in the same way  they work fine without the osfamily property  maybe make osfamily required  
i updated the original description  hope it is clearer now  as i said in my last comment  a more descriptive hover message on the 'run again' button would probably be sufficient to reduce future confusion

hey key  i've tried using master as well  the scrollview issue is resolved in 1 9 2 but another issue is presenting itself  here is an imgur album that illustrates my issue http   imgur com a cbat0  all popups in 1 9 2 popup in the side of the screen  this isn't an issue in 1 9 0 1 9 1  also here is a video illustrating my issues with 1 9 1 https   vid me izo0  the first app is on kivy 1 9 0 as specified by buildozer and the second one is on kivy 1 9 1  the name of the app on the phone differentiates between 1 9 0 and 1 9 1 if you can't tell which is which  the right is 1 9 1   all screen shots and video listed are compiled from the same code  the only difference is in the buildozed spec file  requirements   kivy  1 9 0  requirements   kivy  1 9 1  or requirements   kivy  master  i'll get around to posting some code later today if i have time  we can resolve this issue and open one for the popup as well if that would be easier 
that is a way to do it  i already looked into it  i was thinking of a solution in which i just place a config ini in the project folder to enable modules  though adding the modules singleton docs may help others 
thanx for replying  i tried to use kivy on pqlab's overlay  but drag and scale were not working properly  in kivy's config file  i changed  input  default  pqlabs 0 0 0 0 3333 instead of  input  default  tuio 0 0 0 0 3333 and    it's working properly now  i am closing this issue

sorry  no  i didn't have a discussion about this on irc  i am in a useless timezone to generally converse with kivy devs  sadly   i would test that approach  but i have no idea how to use ask_update  it apparently requires one argument  but i don't know what that is  the documentation is rather confusing here   i'm not really sure why i'm invoking ask_update or what the argument might be  maybe a callable i think  but what when will it be called and what will it be invoked with and what behaviour should it have    the docs don't even have an argument in the signature   callback function needs to be called when the texture will be used  richard on fri  3 apr 2015 at 01 34 alexander taylor notifications github com wrote

you build it for the iphone but run it on the ipad  it's supported natively  it runs small and you can do "2x" mode which zooms it in  if you re build for ipad  it will use native resolution  so in short  just build for iphone only and run it on the ipad  it should "just work"

generally i would consider  text upper    to be more pythonic and in line with oop  it might not fit kivy's paradigm  but if it's left as is maybe a note could be added in the api doc  someone with less understanding of python's instancemethod implementation could get confused  str methods are one of the most common attributes i might imagine wanting to use on external objects  but a case could be imagined where type hierarchy might come into play and  cls method obj   doesn't work if cls could be a variety of subclasses  the way it is that case would have to be solved with  getattr  or a widget wrapper method  depends on whether that case is common enough to deserve an implementation change

matham  thanks for the suggestion  like joran says  i think the issue you're seeing is related  but not the same  i've simplified the code leading to the texture id leak i'm seeing and posted it here  https   gist github com flionetti 6d394ae80ba28c77fa7d#file texture_id_leak_simpler py basically changing a label's text_size  which happens automatically if the label's content is changed when no text_size is set  leads to a new texture id  these texture id's are not reclaimed under android 2 2 which leads to crash 
that worked  downloaded and installed http   cython org release cython 0 20rc1 tar gz instead of doing the usual sudo pip2 7 install  u cython step in the kivy install instructions  thank you  
thanks guys  it compiles correctly with cython 0 25  i was using cython 0 24  it might be worth mentioning in the install guide that we have a hard dependency on cython 0 25 now    the installation page lists cython 0 23 in bold  https   kivy org docs installation installation html
i actually start one  and only one  application which _should_ get the initial focus  at least this is always the case if i start e g  chromium as single x app   no idea whether chromium forces the current focus on itself somehow  if this is the case kivy should do this as well   it is not uncommon to fire up one single application w o window manager to achieve some kind of kiosk solution  i also observerd that from some point on  i think it was a reboot  at least the keyboard was working  according to the setting in    kivy config ini   so maybe the keyboard issue is no issue at all and i just produced some noise  i'll do a complete system setup from scratch in order to double check this  stay tuned  in the meantime i also found out how to add a fake cursor via the cursor module  nevertheless i wonder what happens here and what suppresses the system cursor from being displayed  it would be nice to get the system cursor displayed on demand  via show_cursor setting in graphics section of    kivy config ini   so some can implement a display timeout then with   unclutter   if desired  which is my preferred solution 
ok i see now this happen when i use python idle and in console works fine  thank for fast answer   
i packaged my app using the "offical method"  i will try pyinstaller though  thank you very  very much
still happens with 1 9 0
thanks  zeemonkeez  that works  in fact it should probably be the default  in my opinion   in fact now that i look at how logger is being used internally  every single call to logger has to specify where it's being called from  the message looks something like "support  this happened" or "atlas  texture updated"   seems like using module names would help here 
i will probably have time next week  if someone else doesn't make a pull request in the meantime 
i found a kivy launcher 1 9 1 1 download a few days ago  it had the same problem  and it seemed to have more problems than 1 9 0 0   i tried official sample "picture" "touchtracer" with 1 9 1 1  they couldn't run at all  and the splash screen was stretched  wrong aspect ratio   so i doubted  was the 1 9 1 1 an official release  right now i only keep 1 9 0 0  
 keyweeusr good ideas  i just tried about everything i can think of  and it's not crashing  puzzling because i'm running the same way and everything  i guess this issue can be closed until i figure out how to reproduce  sorry about that    but it _really did happen _ ha     
many thanks for the reply  i have great interest in porting kivy to i mx6 that is used in several products with gui  i noticed the sdl2 has support gpu vivante  nxp   freescale i mx6   so i thought to be something i was doing error   i will open the pr soon  thank you 
 dessant not a expert either  but pango handle layout and text rendering  and is using harfbuzz actually  which do text shaping  you give text to pango and it returns a ready to use rendered image  it's more high level than harfbuzz  and hopefully should not be too hard to integrate with kivy  it's used by at least firefox  and gtk+  so it's solid project 
thanks for taking a look at it  i've updated the ticket  if you checkout and build my project you should be able to reproduce it

sure  i can do that this weekend
yes  it work well on desktop
that's already the version of  egl pyx  i have   i have no need or desire to be on the bleeding edge  i just want to run a kivy app on a pi3 without the x11 dependency 
i'm not entirely sure what you mean  i've guessed a possibilities and tried them  i tried creating an on_system_size handler method  but it doesn't seem to ever get called in response to resize events  if you meant scaling via the system_size property  the following code works without applying a division   if you meant something else  let me know and i'll gladly try it 
uhm  no  with this it seems to work for current chrome  will this work for older browsers  too  which don't support native full screen mode  or are they getting the "full iframe" mode 
an alternative repo is perfect  it just needs a semver tag to work  could you tag it "4 0 1"

 gkatsev   you can see in chrome   i am using chrome   version 33 0 1750 146 os  ubuntu 12 04 4 lts
we actually found that the issue was in the way that the video was exported  thank you 
html ids   it's terrible  but it's actually in the dom spec  and it occurs on all browsers  what often happens is someone has an element with an id they want to enable some feature on  and that id conflicts with the name of that feature 
no i have not gotten this to work 
i have chrome version 35 0 1916 141 installed on android 4 4 4 nexus 5

here is a link to an example using relative path for video  http   sandbox saeidmohadjer com video_vjs html if you inspect the video element using a browser dev tool you see it has a "src" attribute  for an example with absolute path checkout video on videojs website homepage  that one has no "src" attribute

 gkatsev encountered it actually  i'll ask if he still has it set up once he gets back
yes  i am loading the demo html file locally  that's actually the way i was hoping to use it though   my project is an offline distribution of khan academy videos  http   ko mujica org    is there anything i can do with video js to improve this use case  any advice for playing local video files in general  thanks for the reply  and your awesome work on video js 
 noob response  i haven't had a chance to setup an environment where i can compile and run tests  i've actually never done any open source work and wanted to carve out some time to figure it all out   git and running tests  etc      and i'm off on vacation for 10 days in a week so work deadline is keeping me busy  but when i get back i'm definitely going to get into this    noob response  on thu  jul 31  2014 at 11 09 am  steve heffernan notifications github com wrote 
sorry what is the native video element 
i created my own version of video js and replaced http    with    and it resolved the problem  so  yes  it does 
i just added playbackrates option  version 4 8 and before  its working  on mouse hover  the playback speed menu appear  after 4 9  its doesn't appear  only works clicks  with videojs 4 8  http   jsbin com bayutu 1  with videojs 4 9  http   jsbin com zoceq 1 
here i recorded a small video  https   www dropbox com s d3kgiy3kadq7y21 videojs avi dl 0 i just click on the video to pause it  not push the pause button  anyone else experience the same  
subtitles shows  if set "nativetexttracks true" instead "nativetexttracks false" this is normal  in this case  the iphone shows 
 mmcc yeah the link that  mister ben posted worked for me as well  after examining further it seems that the problem only occurs for videos that are stored on my local machine  videos that are hosted on the web seem to work fine  would guys mind trying with a local video and see if the looping works  the solution for now is to just host my video online  although i'd much rather get this to work without doing that  i'm running chrome 39   os x yosemite 10 10  thanks again for the help 
 mmcc thanks for taking the time to answer  i am already using the package made by  gityong you refered to but i'd rather do it myself  just to understand meteor better  i'll probably fork it and remove the errors  see  https   github com gityong meteor videojs issues 4#issuecomment 101262320   by the way  i love the video js player  you   heff and the others made an awesome work  i plan to invest a significant amount of time on it  try to make the  video record plugin  https   github com collab project videojs record  made by  thijstriemstra record indefinitely by sending chunks on server and encode them on the fly  and adapt it to video analysis  frame by frame  tags on timeline  "extract" chuncks using a pseudo record button  etc    i am not sure of how it will go  but if i achieve anything worth contributing  i will

hi  actually the url like this   https    myhost download 06836000001ydbcaay  this returns mp4 media file and this works well in desktop and android devices  problems is only in ios 
i noticed that it works when i go to videojs com with vivaldi  this video plays without any problems and they also use the minified version so that should not be the problem right  i tried it with the unminified version but did not fix it 
yes  i was going to but was having issues with the build failing  do i actually need to run anything to update the docs 
exactly
i need to use the css property "object fit  cover" on it  if i use it on its parent  the method don't work as expected  i can target the video in css with  but i have some js to replicate this comportement on ie  because he don't have object fit  i have use the  soviut logic to get it  thanks  
 gkatsev good question  this is in chrome  but visible across browsers   i am using 5 3 
nope  the idea is  1  click the field  change to the next subtitle  2  previous behaviour  mouse over and showing the popup will still persist  you give the user a faster way of changing subtitles  and when the user clicks the subtite button  then of course the field in the little popup is highlighted  should be easy 
we're using  grunt contrib less  to compile less files to css files  in our  grunt contrib less  task configuration we also process a  css  file named  bower css  which has been created by  grunt bower concat   when the less compiler processes the  bower css  file  it throws the mentioned error  because it obviously has problems with the corruptet character in the file  which comes from the  video js css  file  it could ba argued that this is a less compiler bug  although it would be nice if it's possible to remove the bad character from the distributed video js css file

thanks very much  mister ben 👍 stupid mistake
here's an isolated test case  it's using videojs  5 12 0   videojs hls plugin  3 6 7  and angularjs 1 5 x   as you can see the issue is reproducible and it's basically identical to my application code  note that you have to hit run with js  not sure why it isn't auto running the js bin example  https   jsbin com yoziqikaha 4 edit html js output
unfortunately not  i don't have the time to build one out  my full code can be found in my stream site repo  i can provide access to my dev site if that would help  but i won't be able to build out a live test case for some time 
thanks for your fast reply  yes  you are right  i am sending the headers but the issue was with cors in server side  regards  closed issue 
super nice super helpful thanks to your confirmation i'll be able to sort it now with no concern on spinning my wheels  it'll be something simple and obvious i've missed  great to know it works still  i have a question about setting a 'lower' default volume in the 'data setup' part of inline code  in the script example you showed as working via link above there's this     use this or  data setup '  '  to initialize player not a problem if i never find out as i'm happy with the way it works with the script  yet  i wonder if it's now possible to set a default volume in the 'data setup' options  maybe i'll find it in some doc though i've tried and will try again i expect  i will post back here if i find out how to set default volume with 'data setup' option thank you
 mister ben thanks  i think they do support pointer events in firefox 50 
i can't  i realized we're using an sdk  castlabs  that is probably doing some overwriting of the videojs api 
hi  i do not have a reduced test case unfortunately  i will try to see then if kaltura provides links to mp4 files  also i saw that videojs has a plugin that supports hls something like this    source src "https   example com index m3u8" type "application x mpegurl"   hopefully that will work 
sorry for the delay  both methods work correctly  thanks  i guess i will manage to make pr with fixed docs 
then there should be a way to turn it off  i have only just started looking at the code  could someone point me in the right direction about the best way to do this  functions i should start reading   otherwise  reading and comprehending all this could take a while  
 mister ben i just re tested ios  ipad  and by tapping any place on screen the video toggles play state if control bar is shown  kinda like desktop  but with the first tap to show controls 
hi  magikstm i know i cannot prevent user to download my videos  if anyone looks at the code will see the url  but i am referring to the "copy" on the menu  right click on mouse  
where the videojs code and the video element it is controlling are in different frames  on fri   may 17  2019  12 46 p m  gary katsevman  notifications github com  wrote

yes it works with vesion 7 6 0  thx  
so the strong options seem to be  pep8    pylint   and  flake8   the later is actually a wrapper around  pyflake  and  pep8   i filed merge request  1437 as a proposal for getting started with enforcing linting rules  it removes  flake8   and incorporates  pep8   which seems pretty standard for python projects  furthermore  to accommodate the fact that little of this code complies with  pep8  i added  tox ini  with a list of directories to exclude   pep8  respects the  pep8  configuration found in  tox ini   my idea is that as directories are cleaned up  they could be removed from the exclusion list 
hi eric  i've never worked with latex  but google says  cjk extension  http   cjk ffii org   might be needed 
on thu  oct 18  2012 at 5 42 pm  eric holscher notifications github comwrote    benoît
ok  thanks  it builds as expected now 
how about a more reasonable timeout  i think this is just going to push users projects away from rtd 
my project for example  https   readthedocs org dashboard vpn2  if i change the project name  admin    settings    name  to "vpn²" builds are just "triggered" and remain is this state  if i change the name to "vpn2" or "vpn" everything is being built instantly 
yup  thanks  any idea what resolved it 
 gregmuellegger i can't even get the virtualenv set up  see  this paste  http   pastebin com ktmjkvwe   i get this error in particular   i forgot to do this during the paste  but the file  tmp pip build ezd5ca factory boy does not exist 
yes  as i said  no  master  there  and not selecting anything            does obviously   not   choose the vcs default branchname as the help text there says  which would be  master  in case of git   smells like a bug 
thank you for the help   here is the url https   github com noralk testdocs
fixed  thanks 
hey  humitos  1  yes  it happens only with   sphinx_rtd_theme    2  no  problem is still in place when i build locally 
yes  it works locally 
thanks  richardlitt  i have edited the issue  let me know if it is clear 
 agjohnson it doesn't seem to happen in incognito  which is interesting because i tried disabling some addons and it had no effect  you can close this  since it's an addon of mine  i just have to figure out which 
i'm sorry but i could not remember    i've been using read the docs about several years so i may accidentally connect to another user but currently i only know the account i showed 
 stsewd   we don't have any integration configured apparently    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 99779 56859454 5408d800 69df 11e9 801e 0c38cee9ffbe png 
 humitos you're absolutely right  i didn't read the two  conf py s carefully when i submitted this issue  thanks  i added  docs source conf py  as "python configuration file" and at least the last build succeeded  https   readthedocs org projects storyboard builds 5169712   it's kind of weird rtd can't find  docs source conf py  though  it's one of the few standard sphinx configurations 
yeah honestly i have never used readthedocs till now  but it's frustrating cause it's one of the first results on google when searching  but also way out of date so i figured i would update what i could if possible 
 richardlitt i think it is same as issue https   github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 3166
well the issue template is for online projects only  but as i said above im tried to get it to work on my osx machine and i was just following the installation instructions  nevertheless i manages to patch rtd to work with the latest django version which suprisingly didnt took that much effort  https   github com rtfd readthedocs org pull 3305
thanks for the additional help  willingc  i am still very interested in finding out why the build time for this suddenly became 10x longer  we may add more notebooks in the future and would find it frustrating to have our builds constantly on the verge of timing out 
whoops  sorry i left that out  the page that contains that link is  http   docs readthedocs io en latest getting_started html
thanks but  the rtd creates conf py  but not in my git repository  i cant found this file in anyway  all documentation of rtd speak about local linux install rtd  but never about uses rtd web  i not understand how extrat the conf py and other to put in my git project 
yes  the build is with the new repo   the links in readthedocs bar  lower left  that has the "on github" section are fine and updated  but not the link on top right  
yes  locally it works  using pip with   no site packages  on ubuntu 17 10  not sure what you meant by "installing using pip"  but doing this  https   github com afm analysis nanite commit 3ac1eb9dda8aeb8cebbeabe441a3df0f1b965f0a does not help  https   readthedocs org projects nanite builds 8045730 
http   icalendar readthedocs io en latest  internet calendaring and scheduling  icalendar  for python  it was reported the issue to the project maintainer as well  suggesting to update their project theme 
just triggered a new build of latest https   readthedocs org projects clifford builds 7448400 
thanks for pointing that out  i should have showed more of the log  the problem is not that  click_default_group  is being installed _per se_  rather  it is that it is being installed instead of  click   which does not get installed  i wiped and rebuilt and am still getting the same problem 
 humitos every build now  probably we have reached a limit with tex 
thanks  stsewd   i figured as much  but worth checking  yes  this is probably what we'll end up doing  lesson learned  cool  will look into this  i'll close this 
  that potentially fixed it    edit  this only revealed the underlying cause  i was looking for an option like that under the admin part of the control panel  but since it wasn't there  i assumed it clears it every run  now i'm getting new issues which do not occur locally  but i'm not sure yet why they occur  https   readthedocs org projects fplore builds 8213711     edit    i think i've figured out the origin of the new build failure  i use sphinx gallery  which is in my docs requirements txt  the  python  home docs checkouts readthedocs org user_builds fplore envs latest bin pip install   exists action w   cache dir  home docs checkouts readthedocs org user_builds fplore  cache pip  r docs requirements txt  build step then installs those   sphinx gallery  has  matplotlib  in its requirements txt  but without a version  so the latest  3 0 2  is installed  i explicitly specified    2 2  in my setup py for python 2 backwards compatibility  during both steps i believe packages are installed to   home docs checkouts readthedocs org user_builds fplore envs latest lib python3 5 site packages    so i assume an unclean downgrade of the matplotlib package is occurring  see also  this issue  https   github com matplotlib matplotlib issues 11122   how would i fix this  elegantly   adding matplotlib with an explicit version string to docs requirements txt wouldn't qualify  since this would add redundant information that's already present in my setup py    edit 2    and then rerunning the build without clearing the cache gives the initial errors from this issue again  https   readthedocs org projects fplore builds 8215731    so this does not fix it    edit 3    i also  cannot  reproduce this locally  my attempt was to first run  pip install  r docs requirements txt    pip install seaborn   due to  this  https   github com sphinx gallery sphinx gallery blob master setup py#l18 l22   and then  python setup py   force   the docs build fine on my machine after running this setup sequence  this makes it rather hard to debug 
this happened for example in build  8395475  https   readthedocs org projects delira builds 8395475   and worked after wiping the environment in build  8395750  https   readthedocs org projects delira builds 8395750    note that both builds worked on the exact same commit of the repo 
sorry for the details i miss pressed the enter button  i think i can fix this by changing  pylint django 2 0 5   to  pylint django  2 0 4  
what do you mean build correctly locally  i'm not an expert at this by any means 
under settings  it is configured as subversion… there was a mistake  that the default branch was set to latest  but that didn’t dix the problem
python 3 7  sphinx 2 0 1  i can now reproduce the problem locally if i back off to sphinx 1 8 5 
sure  i think i have removed these codes https   github com jsk ros pkg jsk_docs commit cb9ea3e1d6061207dea6847f9f1afbb8729fddf1#diff 684a0ceb2878d48b19612ca360e277ef    ◉ kei okada 2019年7月25日 木  19 49 manuel kaufmann  notifications github com  
that is what i suspected  something wrong with the updating of the search index  i've tried rebuilding the site a couple times  is there anything else i can do to help debug this 
hi  humitos yes 
on the project page i have my project  i'm trying to add translating but when i click the dropdown it doesn't show any projects on the dropdown 
backslash works  i didn't expect the keyboard bindings to still be in effect while using the game pad  i thought it was one or the other 
i am using the beta that was sent out at the end of last month  march 2013   i was playing pokemon emerald  i did not try other games  i can get you a screenshot later today  i am at work now 
yeah it is definitely more of an issue in landscape  but it does affect square and portrait as well  i just think it would be better to have the original artwork as opposed to the washed out look  like itunes does for cover art 
im not sure  i downloaded this a long time ago  i just tried reinstalling and its doing the same thing
i'm not at home right now  so i can't test removing the controller  i'll be home in a couple of hours  so i'll give it a go then  out of curiosity  jvzr  which gamepad were you using  i'll be able to test with a different gamepad when i get home too   an xfx generic usb pad  i also witnessed a crash when trying to use the xbox 360 pad's analogue sticks   i'll report a separate issue when i get home and attach the crash log 
is the crash log the thing that's shown when i click "report" on the "this application quit unexpectedly" box  i'll reproduce the issue and copy that here as soon as i'm at my computer
i tried it in different games  have same result  you just need to run snes game that use different actions on all four or at least 3 buttons  first time i found it in jungle strike when i tried to fire heavy missiles  but it started firing with bullets and sometimes heavy missiles 
 okdana that is precisely the rationale i was thinking  thank you for putting it so eloquently  such a feature would be a luxury really  was just sharing an idea for future enhancement 
it works perfectly with the last pre compiled build  1 0   i tried to compile in order to have access to the n64 implemented emulation  i really don’t know why it seems that i’m the only one to have that issue… on 26 dec 2013  at 19 14  clobber notifications github com wrote 
thanks okdana  i did not have the path on my nas set as the game library location  i had erroneously assumed that when games were dragged into the app  it would remember the path of the games  i tried this and found this option under library preferences  however   my folder structure is like this  games emulators nes roms games emulators snes roms etc  so i do not have a single rom path  i tried selecting the parent directory  games emulators   though this did not seem to work and led to the same error message   i set the path as above  the parent directory   imported a new rom  checked it worked  closed openemu  restarted the mac  opened openemu and tried to load the game    same error message  i tried to go to the path in finder using the "go to" feature   this wouldn't work  i can navigate to the folder manually in finder  but not by inputting the location via "go to"  one thing i noticed  when i go there manually  i select a shared network drive called "diskstation"  then a top level folder called synology  however in openemu the top level reads as   volumes synology i don't know if this difference matters  if i put the directory into "go to" in finder as the  volumes synology directory  then it won't find it  how do i check which protocol is being used to access the nas  thanks 
i did not try 32x games until version 1 0 1  so i can't say if they worked with older releases or not  i have tried multiple roms which support 6 button controllers  i tested afterburner  mortal kombat ii  star wars arcade  and virtua fighter  none of them detect a 6 button controller  i have tried restarting openemu  tried restarting the computer  tried a different controller  tried using only the keyboard  6 button control works fine for genesis games  macbook pro retina 15" late 2013 w  gt750m mavericks 10 9 1 openemu v 1 0 1 829 gfe1aabc release

i've just installed el capitan on a new ssd and i've download xcode and openemu from git today  i had the same problem on yosemite and i thought i would have better luck on a fresh installation  
okay  i've determined that the issue was that the save states i made in version 1 0 4 must have gotten corrupted during the upgrade to 2 0 1  or moved    but i don't think the system would hang if that were the case   when i started the games without any save state  they worked fine  and i was able to create new  perfectly functional save states  this happened with gameboy color games  i'm not sure if it happened with other systems because that was the only one i was using

yes i did  i'm not using any keyboard modifier  neither antivirus  only chrome  but as i said  even reboot and running openemu first didn't helped  as for usb  i don't have anything but external hdd and mouse plugged in  are ps2 keyboards supported by openemu   i am using one

thanks for the response  my primary interest for now is to first understand if it makes sense to have rstudio as a docker official image  steps for doing the same are in the link posted in my previous comment  it also mentions the considerations for making an image official  if that happens  the image comes under docker's "official" image program  they then take over the daily builds etc  also it gets published under https   hub docker com explore    however the maintainence is to be done by upstream
it is strange  i login with another pc which works good  however the original one is still not working even they are on the same session  both clients are on windows 10 64 bit chrome 61 0 3163 100  official build   64 bit   rstudio server 1 1 383 with ubuntu 16 04 3 lts    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 13925196 31398772 9f3770aa ae1c 11e7 8b63 64e80a2847df png    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 13925196 31398789 acf9d52a ae1c 11e7 89db 9346030a0cac png 
i experimented with changing locale and realized that changing windows settings to en us solves the issue  it's interesting that the issues only applies to build pane "console"  the main r console does not have this problem  i e  handles the locale settings correctly  i have updated issue name and added more specific example how to reproduce the issue 
i experimented with various versions of rstudio and machines without any reasonable outcome    rstudio 1 1 463 works fine    removing all the user settings does not help    using rstudio install from tar ball does not help    i couldn't reproduce the issue on another linux machine with the same os and very similar settings  i would like to try some earlier version of rstudio 1 2 as i haven't noticed the issue until around 1 2 1300 versions but i do not know where to find older builds  could some shared libraries on my os be blamed for interfering with rstudio 
sorry  i mean the pop up window after you click 'new connection' button  only livy and spark show up in the options 
ohhhh  yes  that works  for all three—document directory  project directory  and current working directory  closing as user error 
it comes up even if there's no   git  directory  even after a brand new installation  it also up when i choose  open project  and  new project   it's the same behavior as if i run   usr bin git  from the terminal  but what i mean to say is  if i have no interest in version control and never chose to do anything with  git   i still keep getting prompted to install it and xcode because the git executable is  correctly  set to   usr bin git   so i effectively have to tell rstudio and macos that i'm not interested in version control by telling it that the  git  executable is something incorrect 
 kevinushey the report i sent above is from work  i've seen it on my personal pc as well  but can't reproduce right now  i'll send the extra required information on monday 
thanks  kevinushey for the quick reply   r   devtools  and  reprex  ran ok from the os terminal  i've just tried    delete the   rstudio desktop  folder in   home     purged  rstudio  from the terminal   installed the latest daily version    71    the preview  70 1  all versions would crash if i ran either  library devtools   or  devtools   + tab   loading any other packages such as the  tidyverse  didn't crash rstudio
see  that is the problem  as soon as i open rstudio it crashes on me 
it's on the list   
you're right  sorry for not researching the past issues enough  this did fix it 
ok   here is the additional info  it is in the   suggests   and only needed in creating a vignette if a svg graph is missing  correct   on github at  https   github com rkrug plantuml  https   github com rkrug plantuml   devtools  check    gives the same error 
thank you  jmcphers i can confirm th at the moment  i have not yet installed rstudio 1 2  since the compiled version is not yet listed  will try that later 
on the r console  i get  "  r x86_64 pc linux gnu library 3 5"  the above string appears neither in  etc rstudio rsession conf  nor  etc rstudio rserver conf  
here is the info  version  1 2 1335 platform  server  ubuntu 16 04 6 lts  xenial please let me know if any additional information is needed  thank you 
 ronblum after spending some more time on this  i noticed the following more straightforward example better reflects on the issue  please go through the following steps to reproduce the issue    run the following code   it will create a data frame where the type of the first column is logical  and the type of the remaining columns is double    adjust indices of columns to see only columns 50 51  a total of two columns   then apply "filter"  you will notice that the type of column 50  the first column in the new two column display  will be logical  while it should be double 
yes  i didn't know you could have more than one 
i'm editing the  py in rstudio's editor and running the code in an interactive python session at the terminal
 serpico7456  yes that does work  thanks

thanks for the reply  sorry  i do not see that option in my version  i will have to update  i determined my version was 1 0 143 by finding the version file in the program files  let me try to clarify  i get it  it is mostly code and it was a long shot request  this was an "enhancement" idea i had  i was encouraged to pass along  i don't need it     my idea was it is somehow smart enough to check only the words within certain tags  particularly  in the ways rstudio ide is geared toward shiny app development  like maybe when you runapp   the words in the viewer pain that are mispelled are tagged or highlighted in some way 
in r  without r studio  it works fine  there is another mystery    on my second computer  windows 10 also   with the same user name  resulting from same live login   i could reproduce the error either  rstudio works there  issue seems to stem from rstudio    but only on this mashine  another thing  also only on the notebook   when i start rstudio without administrator privilege  it fails  see attachement   the only thing thats different between the two systems besides of hardware  on the notebook  the one with the error   there is an active bitlocker  but not on the pc    fehler_1  https   user images githubusercontent com 35802252 35456455 ca060ff4 02d5 11e8 8466 ba04217a5669 gif    fehler_2  https   user images githubusercontent com 35802252 35456462 cf70f3fa 02d5 11e8 8d96 2ea149561595 gif 
 ronblum nope  i'm not using  packrat   if you're familiar with azure hdinsights  all the packages were installed using "action scripts" which installs the packages on the head  edge and worker nodes when the cluster is created 
nope  it works in the daily  thanks 
my bad  i missed that freebsd kept qt5 webengine at 5 9 5  "www qt5 webengine is a huge monster that is terrible to update  just like www chromium itself is "
this is boost from freebsd ports  it hasn't been built with any special options  and is supposed to work for everything

thanks for quick response  there is a prompt before doing any downloading  and after that the data is cached  so it then behaves like any other data frame  this strikes me as the sort of thing active bindings were meant for  but i could be wrong  writing r extensions mentions wrapping c pointers and database access as examples  either could cause problems if done without the users intent 
upgraded both boxes  works on both 
can confirm also that changing from the dejavu sans mono font that comes by default makes those underscores visible 
i do have a startup script that modifies the library paths  but  find package "knitr"   returns the first path  +   knitr   from   libpaths    
yes  it was related to the font  i forgot i wasn't using the default one  i'm sorry for the disturbance  problem solved 
 jmcphers  i'm referring to the keyboard shortcut quick reference provided by rstudio  as seen following    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 6463211 48741368 d0abc380 ec95 11e8 9eb4 d65a1d9434dd png  it seems overwriting the original shortcut for compiling the rmarkdown document 
tried 1 2  it works  thanks  but there's the other thing i mentioned too  about switching to the correct working directory when clicking on the tab of a source file  eg  i have an r studio project open with file "main r" open in one tab  i also have another r script "s2 r" open in r studio in another tab  technically  i'd call s2 r as a project  even though it's a standalone script and not officially a "project" in r studio terms   this s2 r script is not in the same directory and is not part of any project  it's a standalone script which is programmed to read a csv file that's located in the same directory as the script  although the working directory of main r is used correctly  when i click on s2 r's tab and try to run the program  it says it cannot find the csv file  so i hope y'all could implement the automatic changing of working directory for whichever file is currently in focus in r studio  it'd be a bit help  thanks 
yes  i'm using the same version of reprex for both  0 2 1    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 14981085 46956446 f8868680 d05a 11e8 9781 19b125831792 png  this is the traceback

 kevinushey  i was running an example that i found online  i don't actually need to read  stdin  in general  the issue is that when i ran  readlines file "stdin"    i could not do anything in the rstudio console  i had to restart the r session  the issue that i'd like to have fixed is that the command above should not block the console  could  stdin  handling be updated so that  readlines file "stdin"    just returns  character 0   like rgui does

 ronblum  ctrl+j ctrl+j  et al  work great  even if i remove  ctrl+a  from 'go to start of line'  ctrl+a ctrl+a  doesn't work  but not the end of the world  some key presses produce a conflict warning  however  ctrl+a  isn't one of them  neither is  ctrl+n  which conflicts with 'move downwards one line' 
ok  checking it in my personal computer  ubuntu 18 10 and rstudio desktop 1 1 463  it works but the same version of rstudio  desktop  on the 16 04 version of ubuntu at work doesn't work  both os are 64 bytes
it appeared just once  but i haven't seen it since then  even if i updated some other  ubuntu  packages while having rstudio open  i provided the list of updated packages in case they are somehow related to rstudio internals

thanks  strange  ronblum  sorry to not give more details about the environment  here you go   also  just to be clear  on macos  i hit  cmd   not  ctrl  to produce the problematic behavior  also  i press  cmd  and then i click  i updated my initial post ot that effect   kevinushey the 'real' body of the function seems like something more ambitious to achieve and i believe it's also not necessarily more helpful because there is no point in editing this body  rather  i'd want to edit the call that created the function  as far as the printing method of functions created with  purrr  partial    goes  there was some discussion about that in https   github com tidyverse purrr issues 681 
dear ron  1  same windows 7 build as you 2  i'm actually using the french  canada  keyboard  i see the same expected behavior as you  press twice to have the "hat" accent in french  in any other application  but rstudio ide  actually  i found that the bug is happening more cleanly when i switched from english to french keyboard   1  using windows language bar  i've mapped the sequence "ctrl + 1" to get english keyboard  and "ctrl + 2" to get french  canada  keyboard  quick way to change between language when programming  2  the freeze happened systematically when i pressed the "hat" key after switching from english to french keyboard using the ctrl keys  3  if i switched between keyboards using the mouse  there is no freeze when typing the hat key  i've downgraded to rstudio 1 1 463 and everything working as expected  there is no interference between switching keyboard using ctrl keys and the hat key  thanks for your help  hans
oh  i did search for open issues   i'm not sure how i didn't find those  anyway  i'm encountering the issue on win10    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 18528306 58160492 def78e00 7c7e 11e9 91e4 0034529f8628 png  the system has intel® hd graphics 4600  as of writing this  i've noticed that the installed driver is 3 years old  so i'm currently  trying to  install a newer driver to see if that resolves the problem  the problem does disappear when i force the use of software rendering  but i was rather pleased with the  perceived  performance boost of using gpu rendering 
i've tried to change it and it works  thank you  for those that encountered similar issue go to tools   general   advanced   rendering engine  pick  software   click apply  the rstudio will restart and you should be good to go 
1  i have an hp spectre x360 13t running windows 10 1903  though this issue has always occurred  even before 1903  specs are as here    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 21211494 61143022 bf1e6280 a496 11e9 90dc 4c9b79da11fa png  i think i heard hp makes their own display drivers or something like that  instead of using the windows ones  so that could very well be part of the problem too  2  switching to software rendering didn't change anything  nor did switching to opengl 
r version  r x64 3 5 1 os version  microsoft windows 10 pro   10 0 17134 build 17134 rstudio  version 1 1 456
i reset the preferences  but that did not help  my r installation  i installed the required libraries using  brew  and afterwards i compiled r itself form source  i did not have any issue with that before  the error message is a bit cryptic for me  what could be the problem with openblas  the older version of rstudio starts fine 
the code below runs on my machine in 0 65 and 1 60 second segments  but switching back to the first graph from the second took approximately 20 seconds  counting in my head   and took approx  75 seconds going from the first back to the second   macbook pro  15"  mid 2018  2 6 ghz 6 core intel core i7 16 gm ram
yes  that command completes succesfully 
that worked  thanks
the  libudunits2 so 0  lib is located in   usr local lib    i have no idea if this the standard location for this lib  was the folder suggested by the  udunits2  manual   actually for some reasons  address not found by curl apparently   i was not able to install  udunits2  using my regular package manager  concerning my   ld_library_path   here the list   i did not know that rstudio would use another   ld_library_path  than the one of my global env  where should could i modify that  many thanks in advance 
hi  ronblum  i'm not sure it is package specific or just part of the rstudio help section but i have attached an example of what i mean from the broom package    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 14663215 70759592 0472f300 1d9b 11ea 8dc9 2b763236acb0 png 
the following code works for me with  r version 3 6 2  2019 12 12     "dark and stormy night"  outside of rstudio desktop  1 2 5033  on a windows machine  i am able to create the object  ple4 retro  which i can't do inside rstudio desktop  1 2 5033    however  i did not try rstudio desktop 1 3 776 
hello  no  it still doesn't  touch scrolling works  but mouse scrolling doesn't 
sorry for the delay   drwxrwxr x  user is owner  group is primary user group  actually the home directory is a symlink to another drive  the other users' directories that are accessible are normal  just like the ones with underscores  i've also noticed that once in a subdirectory  manually entering path  parent directory navigation works  you just can't click anything else 
hi  ronblum  thanks for reaching out  i was cloning from an open terminal  and deleting and launching the project from finder  i then tried deleting the repo again from the command line with the same result  everything looks fine in the r console 
so if i do do  new pouchdb 'https   mydb cloudant com'  info   then       does that make exactly one http request  i'd like to do it in the most efficient way possible  i had been going off your docs which say "this method creates a database or opens an existing one "
#1728 seems to do the job  if you've a chrome app to hand  try simply 
my actual use case doesn't involve iframes  but i still have the db info   problem  when i get to my ipad tomorrow  i will make a simple page test  no codepen  no iframe  and see what i get 
this is all i get in the console 
when i set for the first time the listener  all the documents are read  is it possible to re trigger this behavior  read all the documents through the listener  without releasing the listener and re setting it 
i'm confused about last_seq when using the bidirectional sync   option  i have the remote central server with data  and client empty  then i exec the sync    and all data is "downloaded"  then i have from the sync 'complete' event  info push docs_read   0 info push docs_written   0 info push last_seq   0 and info pull docs_read   1230 info pull docs_written   1230 info pull last_seq   1445 i that scenario  if i call changes    since  info push last_seq    i get a list of all documents downloaded  which i dont want to list on this case  on that first "get all local documents not yet sync"  which logic must i apply to call changes    since  x    to get an empty list  "oh  right  i've not yet create any local doc   "  but also  on subsequent calls to sync   and then getlocaldocs    i must get the "this documents could not reach the server " list  hope u get my point  cheers 
i am developing a mobile app using phonegap   it currently works on ios   android  i am trying to run it on windows phone 7  observed that the adapter  _db_name  _adapter for the pouch db object in case of windows phone 7 was returning value as undefined  i tried setting these values explicitly but that did not help  is this a bug  just to re confirm i tried to get prefix property value and it returns _pouch_ correctly as expected 
i have a pretty specific use case for interceptors  but i can imagine other uses  stats  etc  the use case i'm working with is that i'm writing to a custom pouch rest server that requires an  authorization  header 
hm  this might be more complex than i thought  i chased it all the way down to just one instance of db changes  live true   without a filter and it was still eating the cpu  so it seems unlikely it's related to the filter as i'd previously thought  same problem on both idb and websql adapters  in chrome timeline it shows the adapter is stuck in a loop  if i create a fresh database the behaviour stops  if i load the the old one it returns  i'll try and reduce it down to something i can share 
latest pouchdb server and i have not modified the revs_limit  replicating from couchdb 1 6 1 
 nolanlawson it looks fine to me  too  which is what is confusing  what would you suggest for setting up live code to reproduce  the live code is here  https   github com beaglelab beagle tree feature save images but it is a bit of a hassle to get it running  as it is in a chrome extension  i can walk you through it if you feel that would be the easiest way 
arg  sorry there   _i found it_  https   github com cdaringe pouchy commit 1c72f356970d3c6f89c285c1e1968df9bdec40ab   it was all me  i really threw myself for a loop 
thank you  nolanlawson    kxepal hi if i reduce it with length 200  it's ok  but i'm using the function   pouch localdb replicate to pouch remotedb  options  which launch the request for me 
luckily i am working on open source so i can directly point to the issue  the test suite  here  https   github com ehealthafrica sense dispatch pull 19  is failing  in the test suite i am  creating a database  https   github com danse sense dispatch blob 9adac351746f25da0f886d3867de9bc7d3e6d0e4 test main lib js#l92  and adding a fixture  and trying to fetch my fixture again  right after this  https   github com danse sense dispatch blob 9adac351746f25da0f886d3867de9bc7d3e6d0e4 test main lib js#l98   the test fails just when it is run the first time  before going ahead with this i should probably update to the latest version of pouch
i have changed the code into  it is pouchdb 4 0 3 that i use 
sure  below my code  it normally fires up the complete listener but he's getting into a loop between active and changes  i don't know if this is only a cb related problem or a general one 
 nolanlawson thanks for reviewing  you may want to warn users in pouchdb find's readme  since it tries to read   type    with   getindexes    it fails reliably when i instantiate set up indices on my second collection  i'll stay with 5 1 0 until   type    is moved back to  adapter js   i can't express how much i love you guys for maintaining pouchdb  thanks a lot  really 
yes cors is enabled  no errors in the console  this code is inside a loop which call the sync function twice with the same client database but two different remote   
oh my lord  that would make a lot of sense   
you welcome  i know this is far from enough  but that was all i could provide before you ask other specific things  iceweasel  the firefox esr  version is 45 1 1 i thought that i should report the result of linux chromium  version 47 0 2526 80 built on 8 2  running on debian stretch sid  64 bit   but i'm not able to  since page seems to be stucked at a point  it's not working till the point iceweasel does either  and there is no console error output i can see  let me dig some more  ### edit chrome outputs to the console the following error after a long delay 
i will test and let you know for v 5 4 5 
ah yes  that's it  i occasionally hit the 'mobile mode' button to test the page look and if i refresh while in that mode it triggers the switch  wasn't aware that mode changed the user agent  thanks for the help 
oh  you're right  nothing is actually saved in v5 either  _feeling sheepish_  the difference is that in v5  the rest of the javascript can run  it builds  lets my react run just fine  in v6  i get the white screen of death as soon as pouchdb gets run 
well i am doing lots of single updates and not a bulkdocs on purpose  thats my usecase 
hello  nolanlawson  i am glad to hear that   smile    yes this is the cyclejs idea  i have not seen npm tags in their community repositories  what do you think is the next step for starting the organization 
i have got couchdb 2 0 0 straight from the mirror and nothing special  i just had a look in the  var log couchdb current file since the normal log did not show anything  the only thing that somehow looks not quite right is this snippet here   it goes on and on like this  the timeout  5000 looks suspicious to me i think some of my design documents are either not quite right or something 
well  i was manually getting some documents from another remote  couchdb  and trying to put them in my local pouchdb with same  _rev   so that after this step  i can keep both these dbs in sync  since the docs have same _rev id   that was my use case  nonetheless i am now approaching this use case using  doc_ids   thanks anyways  it helped 
 willholley no network errors and no dropped connections on the server  when you reload the app  each database performs a couple request and then stop like normal  in total about 5 requests are made when the app is reloaded 
i have tested in safari and chrome  both browser have same issue 
 singhshashi as simple as native like that 
 daleharvey sorry  i missed some code to point out the time difference   the log stating the  remotedburl  is when i initiated the replication  as you can see  it takes around  35 minutes and 42 seconds  for the replication to become  active  or even start  this is triggered during application startup and there is no interim processing  i believe when we start replication  it should start happening instantaneously but it doesn't  unless i am doing something wrong 
i read pouchdb uses indexeddb by default  and i'm seeing indexeddb size increasing actually in chrome  you can see it by clicking "clear storage" option   1  this is really confusing  two of your developers say don't use auto_compaction here  you can see them  https   github com pouchdb pouchdb issues 4372  here   they discuss not using auto_compaction  2  one thing you might want to know  when the size reaches near 4mb  the size automatically reduces to minimum  maybe equal to actual size  but this does actually increase with each update and it's really frustrating 
thanks  daleharvey so in any of the tests i haven't seen less the 21 for these 3 docs but what you're saying it makes sense  just don't know how to trigger that optimiziation  we are doing individual writes to answer your last question  now  any suggestions that will reduce the network traffic are more then welcomed 
for ios it takes websql and for android it takes indexeddb as adapter 
 antonpilyak i  require  the packages because i'm in node  but otherwise i do the same  thanks though  reading the  pouchdb find  code  i can't even tell how the  fetch  method is supposed to get attached to pouchdb  so it's really hard to debug 
i suspect that this problem is due to the fact that cordova plugins do not work in the browser
v10 13 0
i deleted my last reply because of a change in priorities requests  i know there are plenty of other things to worry about  but are we getting closer to having even a sketch of the api documentation  i haven't figured out the create update side yet    ### high post list update flag create comment list create destroy dmail create artist list update note list create update user list ### low
it's fixed now 
i tried to lump the two together because they both operate on upload date  but  age  _would_ be more clear for this  at least 
sorry  i meant that we ought to have one  i've revised the op 
appears to be a userscript issue when using the bookmarklet  pixiv translation plus modified to trigger on the upload page  
i thought somehow there was  but it turns out there's an odd bug in my date parser  though since  order id  sorts posts by _ascending_ post id  you could have the id sort give ascending artist id and created_at give descending creation date  my primary interest is an  updated_at  sort 
the ones in https   danbooru donmai us forum_posts 147981 and https   danbooru donmai us forum_posts 148030  the error isn't occurring right now  though  the latter are fixed now without me  and the replacement for the former goes through without error  or apparent effect yet  aside from in the history  
yes  again  same browser  opera 11 60 win32   the problem appears to happen if you navigate to the url provided by the hyperlink  which can happen if you open the link in a new tab window 
yes  my danbooru name is kusaga
thank you for your answer  it was just 2 hours ago  i will wait more and see it if get resolved 
sometimes it loads  sometimes it says "picture doesn't exist" 
pretty much any post that's a revision and whose previous version has an artist commentary  either just original or both original and translated  i know copying the commentary over to the new version of a post isn't as tedious as copying notes but it's always nice to have a quicker way  even if it might not get used as much  http   danbooru donmai us posts 1647458 an old post with the commentary already copied over but i think it should work as an example where a "copy all commentary" feature would have been most welcome 
correct  a link to the corresponding page on swfchan  as for categorizing  swfchan allows visitors to categorize files in a few predefined categorizes  some of them could easily be translated to tags 
that is certainly possible  but in this particular case the ability to manually assign sort indexes helped 
there's rodf for ods odt files  https   github com thiagoarrais rodf  but i haven't tried it personally   
one example would be to link to the live site  that this administration interface is for  another example would be when you have a resource that is not directly managed  but you still want to be able to call it  sure this can also be done by linking from the site but it feels like it should belong in the main menu 
yeah  that was the weird thing  everything worked fine except for running tasks from cron  which was 100  fixed by renaming the files in app admin  my cron job is this    usr bin rake  f  srv myapp current rakefile fc import rails_env production  all it does is queue up a resque task  i checked and it was failing when trying to execute the rake task  if i queued up the resque task via console it worked fine 
all file paths look good now  thanks  yup  the only button i see in the wiki on the upper right is   page history    where i'd typically also see   new page   and   edit page    strangely  there's still a _delete this page_ link at the bottom  which i haven't tried 
when i switch to master i get the error in #2399  can't seems to get past it to test the time zone stuff 
in fact  i need to use http   wwwendt de tech dynatree index html to represent product catalog like a tree  and i like active admin    very nice gem  btw      so  i try to cross it together on product's index page ideal situation is  i choose something in a tree at the left part of the index page    i get tree node content at the right part of the page in a table like on default index page of product model  but with corresponding preselected value of filter "catalog tree node"  but i didn't find the way to implement ideal situation  so i just render custom view instead of index page with layout i need  in this case it has to be enough to include only dynatree  js files  because active admin loads jquery in its own js files  but if i do not include jquery js itself on this page i can't get working dynatree  when i include it  everything works but with error mentioned above
it does    what i meant was the layout of the page  in english it's natural to read from left to right so the taps in active admin are set up at the top left  also the tables shoe on the left side of the page while filtering options and other things appear on the right  my suggestion is to reverse the layout  namely a right to left css file to be rendered if the user chooses to apply it over the default css  the taps would be on the right top corner order in reverse than they would be on the left top corner  the tables showing the data would be on the right side of the page also the columns would be ordered from right to left  does that clarify my suggestion  english isn't my first language so i apologize if it's not clear    
ok  thanks  that worked on a fresh install  so i run rails generate active_admin install in my project and it fixed it

i've updated but it seems that nothing changed  i will let you know if i manage to get it working 
hi greg  here is the code  but i had to strip it down a bit   client work   https   gist github com 1704577
solved  filter  associated_markets_id  collection  proc   market all    as   select 
can't because local variable current_user is not available and it throws an exception  "undefined local variable or method  current_user' for activeadmin  resourceds" i ended overriding the filter method by putting the following in the initializers active_admin rb activeadmin setup do  config  module activeadmin           end then i was able to pass the if clause and hide the filters conditionally  filter  merchant   as     select   if    current_user somebody

sorry about that  and thank you for the quick response  yes   adminuser  is used  the thing is we don't use the capability to "admin 'admin users'"  hence no route and no method  besides  we use what i think are the default routes

i can't find a pattern that causes the issue  i've tried  songkick    oauthclient    oauthclient   and  oauth2client   that i can remember   they all cause this issue  the different controller names you've pointed to are from my copy pasting  i get that same pattern each time and i must have mixed in 2 different queries  we have an old admin interface that's already using   admin  and that's not going to go away until we can replace the functionality with activeadmin  would you recommend trying something unrelated like  new_admin

 maartenvanvliet for sure  in my case  i've in my application_controller a variable called  categories and in the active_admin  a page called  categories   that was the problem  to solve this  i created a new controller  called basecontroller and my others controllers extends this one  i think that we can close this issue  maybe  the problem is in my application  thank you

working on it   
see the irb session  the decorated model does not set its id to nil when dupped  which means if you want to copy some models and then save them this will override the original model  sort of like  pseudo code   as the posts here will end up with the same id as the one they were dupped from  they will override the original in the database  thereby the original blog loses the posts and the posts are only attached to the new_blog  that is one of the problems we encountered  there were others due to that exact reason  but i can't recall them atm  i just see the tests that say "it doesn't go crazy when the object is decorated"    
in few controllers

for disposal of doubling nested resources  this error appeared in all simple applications since the last update ror  the only thing they have in common   nested resources is polymorphic

looks like it might be related indeed        something like on every reload an extra reload hook get's added   i'll try to see if i can provide a fix in a pr early july  leaving for holidays tomorrow    
hadn't seen there were two of them  i pulled using  meta_tags_and_tag_conflict  branch name  so i'd say #5895
yes  you are correct  i reloaded the homepage  what do you mean with 'do you have anything in your page tree'   i send your a sql dump of my website 
all the pages of my website are live  i checked this in the database   my website contains information about fences and gates  when i search for the word gate  the search module shows 5 links to pages which contains the word gate  the total result however  above the search result  shows 6  there is a mismatch between the links shown and the number of total results   the website is in dutch so i actually search for different terms  good luck with bug  version 2 2 will be great 
its fix up on newest master branch
yeah  public uploading is such a common source of hacks  and svgs make it pretty easy to write whatever you want into them  you could pretty easily get developers into trouble  the first step here though would be getting the error message to actually tell you what is up  it seems to me that it's an issue with the compressed svg format not having a prolog  if the error said that at least users could fix it

i could do that but then i would have to determine the correct format to insert it as  right  since there are multiple formats the datetime field supports  i would still want it to process it instead

thanks for responding phil  i see it as an extra layer 'above' what you've currently got  i e  in top right  instead of "add post"  display "manage blogs"  on this page  you can create edit delete blogs  ideally  when deleting blogs  we can choose to migrate articles into another blog  although maybe this feature could come later  below that strip you'll need to allow the user to enter the different blogs and perform the current actions  perhaps the next level of links could be the names of blogs setup  instead of the current "blogs" and "categories"   then move categories into the body of the page itself  so that users can create categories for each blog  something to consider is whether users are allowed to create 'shared' categories i e  if the name of a category exists in other blog  will users be allowed to do that  if so  will the category list display all entries from all blogs that share the category  probably yes  but you will need to warn users when they create such a category  another feature for later is the ability to move individual articles between blogs 
hi  philsturgeon    they fixed in develop  i tried to upgrade codeigniter in pyro but no success  anyway i will keep using php 5 3 because of some other reasons  https   github com ellislab codeigniter commit 7b5eb7310e5980ffb23fde8a11261e4a40c3b90e

that is what i wrote
after setting up the "products" page type  connecting it to the "products" layout and creating a page with the "products" page type  i created a default page with the slug "products"  i made this default page with the slug "products" the parent of the page with the page type "products"  i got the page not found browser error  not an error from pyrocms  just by browsing to either of those pages  removing the default page with the "products" slug made it possible to browse to the page with the "products" page type without getting an error   edit  also  i don't know what happens when there is no child   parent relation 
yes it did  thank you

oh  that looks bad  at first i didn't know that git message strips " "  then i tried to amend last commit but there was merge conflict which created another commit  then i deleted whole branch and created new  commited there and felt proud how clean i solved everything   
done https   github com pyrocms pyrocms pull 3085
it's a stream management module  but with a completely different concept than what's in the pro version of pyrocms  much more flexible  it basically acts as a framework to create your own stream based modules  it's well suited for small to large projects  it really is flexible and super easy to use  we are planning to release a first version in one or two weeks 
my original fix had issues  i believe these issues are resolved with pull request below  https   github com pyrocms pyrocms professional pull 129
maybe this is baked in by default at a field level  i just assumed the absence of a namespace implied global  if that is the case  tags are namespaced to their field   what if you wanted to share the same tags across two fields  how would you accomplish this 
well   this isn't something i'm "seeing" so much as something i would like to see  but here's an example of what i'm talking about from craft  https   goo gl wsaqzw
 fryiee   i've been creating my streams via the streams module   i'm not sure if it calls  make stream  behind the scenes or not  typically  i'll create the streams on the remote server via the streams module  then download the database and run  streams compile  locally to generate the models for my dev environment 
the form entry in edit mode 
unfortunately the same error is still present  so i don't attach the same error log again  but it is the same one    i've just cloned the repo  git clone https   github com pyrocms pyrocms git   www   then composer install from the www folder and navigate my browser to the root domain  http   pyrocms devsrv   and got the same error
 rafaelfranca yeah sure  is the way i did it the only way to do it 
thanks  rafaelfranca   a sample app is very good way to test  actually when i create a brand new app  "express" works fine too  do you know why a specific name for select_tag not work for some reason  i will close issue 
looks like it is working in 4 1 2 rc1
hmm  you are right the documentation is not clear here http   www w3 org tr html4 interact forms html#h 17 7 but the example given shows that the newline gets swallowed  i tested this behaviour in all browsers i have here and they do consistently eat the newline after the text area  a quick google will confirm this as well   as an aside  the textarea helper in asp net does emit an additional new line  perhaps this is why all browser vendors choose to swallow it  this blog pots has a nice illustration  http   haacked com archive 2008 11 18 new line quirk with html textarea aspx
i'm using  pry   let me know if you need me to disable it  it happens in all pages  console output 
 georgeclaghorn it's working  removed the gem  removed chromedriver from rbenv shims  installed it directly into bin  and it works now  thanks 
hi  josevalim  i really tried to create at least a failing test case but my knowledge of the rails tests suite is too basic to handle this     in this case  i don't know which is the best way to enable disable this global setting for a single test case   
yes  this appears to only be an issue with the memory store  we did manually test with the file store and did not have a failure  we have not yet tested with the other stores  memcached  etc    i know  rubymaverick attempted to add a  dup to the read method  but in his limited attempt  it didn't seem to immediately fix the issue 
this is not related to that kind of issue  after adding that attachable_type method definition  nothing was changed   jonleighton  this was working on 3 0 7  and then broke when i moved to 3 1 0beta  it is also not working on rails master  on 3 0 7  with the exact same model configuration  the sql query that results from it is as follows 
 spastorino once a new rc is released  i will  still fails with 3 1rc4 
4 and 3 2   guaranteed
the actual use case is more complex  i've just reduced it to the minimum amount of code possible to reproduce  the main purpose of the validation is to ensure the once a entity is created  it never goes back to the original  status   think as a model that can be  created  and once  activated  should never go back to  created  
3 1 0 beta1 and i do not know  i suspect this behavior has existed for as long as we've had delegate  i can write some tests later today for it but really i'm asking if this is a problem or a 'sorry  but delegate doesn't place nice with non instantiated associations'  
just did a minimal app and it is fine  must be something else in my app  will close and wipe egg from face 
well    i must say i'm sorry  looks like class_attribute works nicely  if i write it in that class method like this   i was 120  sure i've tested that    but maybe i just did reload  instead of starting the console again  what a fatal mistake  sorry i bothered you with this issue  regards  noice 
same for me  here's what i get  http   pastie org 1998785 bundle show  http   pastie org 1998792 i could also upload the demo project to github if needed 
the behaviour with  build  is identical to  new  
yep   duplicate

 rafaelfranca i have thor 0 19 4 in both versions  5 0 1 has a lot more of these deprecations than 5 0 2 rc1  but i just thought you might want to get rid of all of them  you can reproduce this problem by running  rails g  inside of a generated skeleton application
you're right  it's fixed in the master branch  e98d747705b953a60c27   but it does not appear to be fixed in the 3 1 stable branch  b88e3687d2c89e3a0b54  
ok  closing issue and reopening as pull request https   github com rails rails pull 2393
 tenderlove just trying to interpret your direction above correctly  so on _master_ we would have functionality that adds error to the model and not raise an exception  i suppose sometime in rails 3 1 x stable  we should add a deprecation warning when deleterestrictionerror is raised that this exception will not be raised in the future  right 
no  that's pretty much it  the problem as i see it is not that the new engine should be saved  or that i should have two engines on the car   it's that there is no way to get the old engine _back_  so if i build a new engine   and then the engine is invalid  or can't be persisted for some reason  the old engine can't be re associated to the car  it doesn't even happen in a transaction you can roll back  because the call to  build_engine  finishes successfully  the database state shouldn't change i don't think  no   but it   definitely   should not put the association in an unrecoverable state 
alright  with rails 3 1 0 rc5 and sprockets 2 0 0 beta 15    app     assets       stylesheets         application css

my bad  something weird in my  irbrc thanks for that 
 config assets digest  seems to already be  true  in production rb  as for 3 1 stable  i seem to be running into an issue with git   my gemfile has   gem 'rails'   git    'git   github com rails rails git'   branch    '3 1 stable'    edit    i wonder if this is an issue with windows   
this is on a production server  which i can't provide  it's pretty simple  though  rubinius with puma and sinatra and activerecord  it's infrequent enough that it will be very hard to come up with a sample  do the stack traces above hint at anything 
just this code  routes rb  i say  default params set on "controller#default_url_options" must override the "routes  default" assigment  but works on the contrary routes override the provide callback functionality to defalut_ulr_option

pardon me  i think i have the wrong impression of how concurrent index work  my initial impression is that the index is perform concurrent whenever there is a new insert update during operation  but it turn out that it is more for already existing huge number of records in order not to lock write  for brand new db  it has no effect  sorry for the misunderstanding

 carlosantoniodasilva i think you're right  i could have a primary key in my example because two customers will never have the same  payment_method_token   i could do that with a secondary index for  account_id  and things would work for my example  however  it was just an example  perhaps i should come up with a better example  i do think the current behavior is wrong regardless of my example

rspec swallows a lot of it  but this is the stack from the rails console 
i have a much larger project system using a naming convention that involves square brackets  and would like to incorporate rails without having to revamp my entire file system  i'm not saying i'm a common use case  but rails should function properly within any directory path which uses legitimate characters on a unix file system  more frustrating is the lack of clear feedback    up until actually loading "localhost 3000"  everything appears to be functioning properly  then an error is thrown  which gives no indication about the actual problem  it may be an infrequent situation  but it's guaranteed to reproduce on both unix and mac os x if any " " is in the directory path  with no indication to the user why the most basic rails deployment is failing completely  after spending about 12 hours on the most basic rails deployment  'hello_world'  and almost abandoning rails altogether  and then filing a clear defect with detailed repro on both linux and mac os x  i confess it's a bit disheartening that the response is to suggest that i rename my directory  given the bug  that's definitely my only option at the moment  but the defect remains  and the effect is pretty drastic on anyone who stumbles into it by accident  seems unwise to leave this issue in the rails code  long term

hi   grant olson  yes  i still get good output when i run the script via the rails console 
extremely sorry for the trouble  it was actually a bug in the application code  thanks for the prompt replies 
 gregmolnar   thanks  but i think it's not feasible  because all models of the "page" type have different attributes  and  having actually a couple of thousands of such models  their attributes can't all be stuffed into 1 single table  as it would be the case with single table inheritance 
sorry  you can close the issue  i found that the bug described at https   github com rails rails issues 4919 is actual for the stable 3 2version  but after i opened the ticket  i found that it was fixed at the last https   github com rails rails blob master actionpack lib action_view helpers asset_tag_helper rb just waiting when this commit will be included in stable version 
this is an invalid issue  i removed all the gems and rerun  bundle install  and everything is working fine now  thank you  kennyj
yes https   github com randoum as_bug  i advise you to display the key of the blob being served in activestorage  diskcontroller#show because when the second test runs  the keys from the first tests are served  and as one of them was deleted  as in spec features product_spec rb lines 14 and 24  the error triggers
sure  i'll take a stab at it 
we're not including mocha explicitly   it's a dependency for shoulda matchers  both were out of date  but updating to the latest version of shoulda matchers  including a bump to mocha 0 12 7  did not resolve this issue 
running the test suite  i got some failures  the method  become_content   could be changed to   however  according the convention  if some xml legacy brings a  type  attribute  which would not be a   type   in fact   this solution won't work  skipping the type
here's the gist https   gist github com ace 5284066 i've included two tests  one for a non existent id and another without specifying an id  both fail after the changes in the mentioned commit  i've checked  wangjohn pr and it fixes the non existent id one  but the one without id still fails 
 al2o3cr it generates that in rails 3 2   it works  so from my point of view we could close this issue  however it should mentioned somewhere as a migration step 
for someone that doesn't already know what these lines do  it could appear ambiguous 
no  the model itself for this demo is 
the issue is reproducible using the tests committed in pull request #10328  a b testing of the pull request should confirm the presence of the fault and its correction 
now i do  and it works as it should  my bad  sorry 
yes  same thing happens on master
i just verified this fix  thanks very much 
i've revised the  gist i provided  https   gist github com fny 0c2f96bc4627f63f7b12  to match the template 
it's the same 
i could but it happen with an empty project  here the steps for installing an empty project     mkdir test bug  cd test bug     gem install rails     rails new  t    test bug     uncomment  gem 'therubyracer'  platforms   ruby"     bundle install     rake db create     rails s  b 0 0 0 0  the problem may be coming from the fact i use vagrant with  synced folder   vagrant file  https   github com jonathantribouharet vagrant rails dev blob master vagrantfile  and rails doesn't see the change of the file 
applying the patch from that branch and specifying  default      works  thanks 
thanks paul  adam on sun  aug 4  2013 at 1 30 pm  paul nikitochkin notifications github comwrote 
i'm not sure  the second one is related to sti  which i don't use  and the first is about caching sql in classes with more than one polymorphic has_many  through  and i have only one 
 crunch09 thanks for providing the test case  i got tied up with deadlines 
building this app fresh with 5  i'll see if i can put together a test case 
 rafaelfranca   adding this into the relationship scope does not work  same exception raised   adding this in the category load query works but does not solve the problem which is about the default scope of the relationship  does it make sense  
rails 4 0 0
unfortunately i don't have any rails 4 projects set up right now  this isn't really an urgent ticket  given there's a pretty easy workaround  so i'll update when i get a chance to test it out 
sorry  forgot to mention the version  which is the same as the other issue i created  rails master 8700e5f56cc4ef27193140e416a580adbe10785f
 gem "rails"  "   3 2 13" 
i couldn't get the template to work  so i ended up creating a demo rails app here https   github com roberts1000 migration_break  this is a rails 4 2 1rc3 app with an empty model called blogpost and three simple migrations to create the table  add a column and then change the column   rake db migrate  breaks for me on windows and mac  if i generate the same application with rails 4 1 9  the everything works fine  i tried upgrading to mysql2 0 3 18  but that didn't help  i'm also currently using ruby 2 1 5  here is the full error output 
the feedback above is completely wrong  runtimeerror   you should not use the match method in your router without specifying an http method  also using match is inconsistent with rails4 changes  this is in fact an issue 
apparently it's the capybara shared connection monkey patch that's breaking things  this has worked in every version of rails we've used it on until 4 1 8  
 pre  code    ajax   type  "post"  url  "   docs" datatype  "json"  data    'id' '    '   success  function  data  textstatus  jqxhr           code   pre 
so the above message is what i get debugging using  byebug   no trace  this is the trace the test expectation fails with   let me know if you need anything else 
 robin850 i am using the current master and still experiencing the issue   chancancode i am using a rails form builder with a  hidden_field  and the value is 0 not the string value of the enum field  maybe that's the root of the problem  thanks for looking at this guys 
rails 4 0 2  i haven't tried on  master  but i can get around to checking 
hi  sorry   ive done the a mistake in my code that causes the error  thanks for your test script that help me pointed out my error thanks again   
papertrail is doing it in  #without_versioning  https   github com airblade paper_trail blob v3 0 0 lib paper_trail has_paper_trail rb#l196 l202   the current implementation toggles a class attribute back and forth in a thread unsafe manner  so even if  class_attribute  were fixed to thread safe   #without_versioning  would still not be thread safe  this is why i have an  open pull request  https   github com airblade paper_trail pull 328  that uses a thread local variable instead of a class attribute  even though paper trail is incorrectly using a class_attribute  imo    class_attribute  should still be fixed  in the worst case  multiple threads should stomp on each others' value  they should not crash with a  nameerror  like they currently do 
i thought fetch caches only if there is something to cache for and was surprised for a moment but if this is wanted behaviour im sure there are reasons for that 
a am validating uniqueness of the ownership for the given account  uuid   so  there are could be only one owner

it's at the beginning  when i start the server  i get this normal output on webrick   i already tried to make a application para reproduce the error but didn't achieve it  i will try it another time  the other question is  if you have a suspicion what could cause this problem  if it's somthing related to the assets or something else  what could help me investigate  because i don't know well the depths of rails  thanks  dominik
 rafaelfranca opps my mistake  it should be one of the commits within this  range  https   github com rails rails compare e2530ca   e0cb21f   i forgot i skipped some of the commits when backfilling  i'll find the commit soon 
oh  i was missing the   config load_defaults   in application rb  so   default_protect_from_forgery   was set to false  it is working now    i think this can be closed then  thank you for the quick help and sorry for the trouble 
hi  laurocaetano thanks for your reply  i am so sorry  this is the first time i join github  i don't know how to use it  but i met a problem when i try to use before_destroy method on model  i want to call a method before destroy the model such as the top model post object  object  at the same time  the method i called also use the assoceation of comment object  but the comment object were destroy before i call the method  so  i want to know how could i call a method before the post assoceation' model comment object destroy  thanks very much 
the code at the top of the issue will reproduce it  in routes rb  it breaks because of the redirect in the routes rb file  define any route with a redirect  then create a test that calls assert_redirect_to to test it

that is a good attempt  the implementation looks very weird  lets review the following scenario   as i understood  any query inside the block will be cached  in my case  unpublished count    the patch only prevents batch query itself from being cached  i would propose to flush query cache after each batch instead  via option or all the time   that would solve my case  from other stand point  i would consider  querycache  limit as more ultimate solution that is not bounded to  ar  batches   it could reduce memory usage inside of general http requests  that requires a research though   
yes    post errors  is set due to validations 
rails 3 2 18
 rafaelfranca i looked that template  seem i have to such power to write a script to reproduction this issue  but i can describe the step to make this issue occurs  it is very simple  here is the step  new a rails project
typeerror  can't cast hash to integer
see the  gist  https   gist github com ojab d148814e5ba119315488  in the first message  test cases for both 4 1 1 and master included 
yes  it is in version control and not listed in my gitignore 
i was not able to reproduce in tests using that template  i added all the gems in my gemfile to the template  and customized the post model to include name attribute  i was not able to reproduce  yet  the issue remains in my app  strange  i will continue trying to create a test that will reproduce the issue 
ok  let me see how i can pare down my app to show it to you  without exposing any ip  i'll be back   
rails  4 1 0 ruby  2 1 2
yes  there was an issue in my  database yml  file  try running  rake rails update bin  and see if that shows you where the problem lies 
 aditya kapoor thanks for coming to help   solved this   
for whatever reason  when i try to do  bundle   it throws me this error   for the shake of simplicity  i have used my installed  rails   you can check the bug reproducible script code https   gist github com passion8 1a420e9326059cc4e43e you can download the executable file here http   cl ly code 2v2g2j1g3k2y download rescue_from_bug rb
i have tried to reproduce this issue on new isolated application  but could not  it looks like some gem in our application is the reason 
when trying to isolate the problem  i finally tracked it down to https   github com newrelic rpm  without it  the problem doesn't happen because activejob doesn't get loaded before the initializers  i'm able to reproduce the problem in a fresh rails 4 2 1 app by doing this  then hitting  http   localhost 3000   in the development log  you'll see that it performs the job inline instead of trying to enqueue it into delayedjob   here's a backtrace of activejob getting loaded too soon  https   gist github com aripollak 2694ccb09b669047ab09 is this actually a problem with newrelic_rpm or is it something that rails should be supporting 
 schneems what about the "on   create" declaration  it should be triggered only created not updated 
line 152 of join_dependency rb has this   joinassociation new reflection  self  parent 
here's a repro script 
hi  eileencodes  thanks for coming back to me  this isn't the same issue  the issue is i can't preload that association with   joins     includes  or   eager_load  
the version switching was a false indicator  the issue was caused by the addition of a gem that monkey patches  enumerable   i'm not sure if that's the cause  but removing it resolved the issue  apologies for the false alarm 
yes it is broken on all versions 4 2 1+
ok  you can close this  the scoping was being added by my controller  eg   since  video video was set  it was scoping the reviews to the video 
yes i can try 
so this is weird even the simple case isn't working as i expected  expected assert_same to return true i e 
comparing  a href "https   github com rails rails blob 8a80e3b6c446931330ad07130603712e8d0a2ff3 activemodel lib active_model validations rb#l394" the activemodel  validations implementation of  run_validations    a  and  a href "https   github com rails rails blob 8a80e3b6c446931330ad07130603712e8d0a2ff3 activemodel lib active_model validations callbacks rb#l112" the activemodel  validations  callbacks implementation  a     the former returns  errors empty    whereas the latter uses the return value of  run_validation_callbacks  as its own return value   a href "https   github com rails rails blob 8a80e3b6c446931330ad07130603712e8d0a2ff3 activemodel lib active_model validations rb#l331"  valid    a  is explicitly defined to return a truthy value whenever  errors  is empty  and  a href "https   github com rails rails blob 8a80e3b6c446931330ad07130603712e8d0a2ff3 activemodel lib active_model validations rb#l334" is implemented in such a way that it passes through the return value of run_validations  unmodified  a   consequently  this failure to explicitly set the return value of  run_validations   can result in  valid   behaving contrary to documentation      the above being said  i'm not aware that the return value of  run_validation_callbacks  is well defined  making the production of a test case that reliably reproduces the related failure to this difference in behavior potentially treacherous  i'll make a quick effort this evening  but if a result isn't forthcoming  it might need to wait until i'm no longer in a crunch 
i have just tried setting up a sample app the reproduces the issue  https   gitlab com rp1 bug rails controller test git i discovered that my issue was with rspec rails  not rails  i haven't tested with older versions   5 1 4 
ok  so you're saying in our code i should change lines like validates_presence_of  book_id   author_id to validates_presence_of  book   author
sorry  should have mentioned  adding activesupport to_time_preserves_timezone   false or activesupport to_time_preserves_timezone   true after the line activerecord  base default_timezone    getlocal does not affect the result  i also didn't see  to_time_preserves_timezone  being checked in the code path mentioned in cause section 
exactly  thanks for explaining  issue resolved    on 9 sep 2015 16 09  "scott meade" notifications github com wrote 
this is from 4 2 stable  but as far as i can tell it effects everything from 4 2 0 on 
 rafaelfranca i've been trying to reproduce this bug in other applications  but i haven't managed to yet  the tests always pass locally with fresh projects  any advice on how to approach making a smaller reproduction case  i will give you the time information when i am at a computer again 
i don't think you need to ask for permission   
 sgrif our gemfile is   maybe if  tdooner posts his too  we can start to get closer  i have not had the problem since 
i'm not sure  i know the connection libraries are quite a bit different between rails 3 and 4  i patched 3 2 stable  even though it's no longer supported it seems to still be somewhat maintained with new 3 2 x releases 
confirmed this is not the case  any of my valid routes that i'm using in my application or that appear in rake routes have this same behavior 
yes  thanks 
thanks for trying it  rafaelfranca  i'm using ruby 2 1 5 with rails 4 2 0 but the similar issue was already happening on 3 2 18 should i try with 2 2 0  i was just a really simple script in an other process  in 15 minutes it went from 80 to 195mb  and i guaranty you that if i rerun requests it will keep growing    also notice the spike at 13 33 25     30mb no idea what could have happened there 
i should note that passing  charset  'binary'  resolves the issue  so the main problem is that behaviour changed between versions   and that the default behaviour is now a bit strange 
sorry  here's the info    ruby   version ruby 2 1 5p273  2014 11 13 revision 48405   x86_64 linux    rails   version rails 4 2 0
https   gist github com onebree eefe5c895076dc81f17e at the moment  i am unable to create a new application  i am currently working on a company project  as far as a db adapter  i believe we use mysql2
thanks for the input  yes  i will prepare a pr for further feedback 
i will give it a try  thanks  the bug might be in kaminari  i'm not too sure yet  but i will reopen accordingly when i find out  i found there is a workaround  is to use the the mysql case statement instead of if so if ever someone else gets this trouble  in your datagrid report  you do   cheers 
 rafaelfranca i've found a problem   it was my mistake    i've forgotten to update  with correct value of env 'domain'  thanks a lot for your support   
sure  i will
easy  what active record assoc generates 
i'm still getting these in production so i'll try  but i'm in transit half way around the world this weekend so it'll be next week sometime hope thats ok

the attribute values are mixing  but i don't think this last problem is directly because of rails  i could not reproduce it using the script  maybe it is another gem problem  after updating the rails to 4 2 4  so  it is just the duplication   
here you go  i modified it slightly to use the postgres adapter

this won't work  but the following should   but checking the sanity of the provided key seems important  as with today configuration manager  puppet  chef  ansible      you may end with an env var that might not be what you want  i had a string in my tests and it was crashing on the server because of the technique used to generate the key by the devops team  changing the default  secrets yml  to quote the value would workaround this issue  but you might consider adding a length check  and a  to_s   when feeding the key to hmac 
thank you for reply  i got the point and fixed the code which is working  just to explain what happened  it was index method under articles class where   articles  was causing error however removing s at the end fixed the problem  the error message pointed to corresponding view where app was failing   i noticed that the variable name under  view index html erb  was written as singular but under  controller articles controller rb  it was pluralized  i changed variable's name under  view index html erb  to   articles  by following pluralizing practice  now everything works fine  earlier i was singularizing variable under controller as it was already wirrten as singular under view  that also fixed the problem  i have been usng copy paste method to put multiple lines of code in c9 ide to avoid typos  it is strange that variable name was mismatched  i have revised the code on guide  it has   articles  as variable name under both controller and view which is correct  i wonder if it has been recently fixed 
just add gem 'react rails'  '   1 5 0' to gemfile and run rails g react install you will see the error 
 guilleiguaran it does not happen when rails isn't involved  i built a sinatra app this morning and it's working as expected  edit  i should also add that i also tried httparty to rule out an issue with typhoeus and i had the same result 
this came up when grabbing numeric values from an external source and not checking any validation  i agree it should not generally be called with infinity  but it should throw an error if it does i would think 
aaah  sorry  that i didn't mention the main point  the project was created using  rails new  and then bumped to version 5  is this expected 
this line https   github com rails rails blob master actionmailer lib action_mailer railtie rb#l69 adds  config action_mailer default  to path  this default messes up some checks before this line too  it seems setting  default  on  activesupport  orderedoptions  instance will return this default for any option that's not set explicitly  in a nutshell this is what happens   is this intended behaviour  alias the  hash#default  
 andreaswurm but with that logic  all the remaining defaults should be removed too   
 schneems all green lights locally  if i remove  image_tag   the website loads  i dont understand 
well  i could give it a try  just to make it clear  there won't be such link and the docs should not state about it  right 
 vipulnsward this is the content of my generated file   config environments development rb     this demo application was generated today 
it might take me a day  this is from a production app i'm writing  i'll write a simple one soon 
 vipulnsward yep i took cable config there 
 st0012 that's great 👍   sorry i don't have time for this 
hi  it was new app created with rails 5 rc1 and mysql db  i tried to create first controller  for now i solved this problem removing root password in mysql 
will do  won't get a chance until tomorrow evening after work  what's the best way to resolve this    an actioncable initializer like i have used to resolve already  based on env variables or an addition to the existing development rb file 
i tried but failed because arel version mismatch  how to run  git bisect  between major versions 
using coffee rails master branch does indeed fix this   thanks all 
i can not  because is private project on production server  generally  i run e g 'rails console' and i get this kind of error 
oh  it's intended to not require its own dependency 
i just created this migration and when i run   rails db migrate down version 232323232  it should drop the table users but it did not i have to manually drop the table in mysql
 maclover7  i started rails at version 3 2 0 and it was already present  re tested today   i opened this because this issue because i stumbled upon a bug introduced by this  and it took me some time to find out the bottom of it  i think this is deeply related to the fact that multiplication with a scalar on  activesupport  duration  yields an  integer  
thanks for catching that  i will update the gitignore and push the gemfile later today 
it's pretty stock  mysql for the local db  and sqlite3 for test 
 maclover7 sure  the following reproduces it in the logs that come out  but not sure how to write a test around it 
in this case the   updated_at  is the new attribute  as it does not exist the legacy database has  modified_date  column 
 rafaelfranca yes  ofc  sorry i didn't do that  to begin with   i updated the issue
 maclover7 i'm have no errors here  just issue with setup understanding  as i understand if i need different connection way  solution is to run independent server  because actioncable server instance able to handle only single handler class  right  example scaffold  https   github com merqlove action cable multi id tree master app channels notification_cable
 sgrif i have no idea what it gives in rails 5  the original issue  #7618  has been there since 2012 and the question there was if it still happened in rails 4  that i can confirm and there is a test script to use   https   github com edogawaconan rails hmt after_destroy   
 utilum this is one part of the route  there are also other models linked to the account   meinac changing to this notation works indeed 
sure   maclover7  the app is here    https   github com moonleerecords moonlee website
you are quite right  there is a mistake in the view code  and thank you for help making this clear to to others who read this post  the point of making this issue was to show was that when this basic mistake is made  the uninitialized constant error message returned by rails 6 seems to indicate another problem in the rails code 
## server puma '3 6 1' ## gemfile ruby "2 3 1" 'rails'  '4 2 5' 'rails_12factor' 'heroku deflater' ## production config serve_static_files   true    env 'rails_serve_static_files'  present  config assets js_compressor    uglifier config assets compile   false config assets digest   true i also upgraded to ruby 2 3 3 and rails 4 2 7 1 and it still does not work 
i have tested it locally  and it seems to work  and i don't understand really why this is happening and when the validation is getting called  but it seems to be getting called twice  once when the proxy is properly empty and once after associated records have actually been assigned  if the associated records are being created together with the parent record  then they would be saved before the parent record is saved  wouldn't they 
 company select 'companies    count  generates   i did notice when digging into this that the documentation explicitly says 
strange  i pressed the up arrow on linux  which should have reproduced the previously working command exactly  but instead resulted in the version you see  with the space  obviously a linux problem not a rails one tho   
 al2o3cr you are right  my custom template have chinese chars  i try to remove them  i found it can execute now  thanks to your reply 
im struggling on how to because it is a situation where the schema migration table has more rows than migration files on disk  we "fixed" it by just removing the extra entries in the schema migrations table then stuff started running  on feb 24  2017 02 45  "rafael frança"  notifications github com  wrote 
i created a test app to reproduce the bug  it comes with setup to run the reproducing steps in docker containers  and has detailed instruction in  readme md  on how to reproduce  https   github com plutino rails test
after adding  application json  to my header  the problem was gone  what i did previously is   however i am not fully understand what is the difference between two and how rails response differently to them 
here is the sql generated   select "locations" "id" as t0_r0  "locations" "name" as t0_r1  "locations" "street" as t0_r2  "locations" "city" as t0_r3  "locations" "postal_code" as t0_r4  "locations" "phone" as t0_r5  "states" "id" as t1_r0  "states" "name" as t1_r1  "states" "iso" as t1_r2  "states" "updated_at" as t1_r3  "states" "created_at" as t1_r4 from "locations" left outer join "states" on "states" "id"   "locations" "state_id" where "locations" "account_id"    1 and  name ilike ' the  '    "account_id"  1    
well i think it's a bug that if you define a date_format for the  db format that the sql is invalid rather than just overriding the  db format  do you know what i mean  it should take my override of the  db format and use it  rather than create invalid dates in the generated sql statements 
thanks  this was a bug in sprockets rails   i've submitted a pr for it  https   github com rails sprockets rails pull 418  
hello  yes i have turbolinks enabled and its rails 5 1 3  i will try to reproduce and send server logs   but at the moment i need to find a way to stream the data only if the the page   dashboards  x  is open  
 gwincr11 thanks  that makes sense  but i think the current behaviour of running callback twice if i want to add an onload event to either type of the controller is not a good user experience  rafaelfranca would like to know your thoughts before closing the issue
 rafaelfranca i'll take a shot at it  i looked into it briefly and couldn't pin down the cause of the problem so i thought i'd open an issue to see if anyone else knew what it was 
thank you for this very quick answer  indeed  i misread  the documentation  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord querymethods wherechain html  and didn't see the example  so unfortunately  this isn't a bug strictly speaking    i would love to see this behavior deprecated changed though 
 y yagi i have uploaded a file when triggering a 404  development log  https   github com rails rails files 1911720 development log 
it wasn't a mistake  however  i got around to fix this  turns out i had an issue where my  a  link was located at a different location than the contents of the  a  link  this was due to styling related changes  i'm not yet sure why this led to it converting from 'delete' to 'get' but correcting the style in my code helped fix this
 rafaelfranca nope    i am using  better errors  https   github com bettererrors better_errors   but that shouldn't cause an issue   img width "752" alt "screen shot 2019 06 24 at 19 56 35" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 11435593 60040894 4e1b3480 96ba 11e9 9e3e f50527c5e660 png" 
i've also been seeing the same issue with symbol joins  during the weekend i will make a test script 
hello  oniofchaos  sure  we use docker so it's not a problem to test it on multiple versions  i've been able to reproduce this error on all 5 x versions available on https   hub docker com _ mariadb  as of now    5    5 5  and  5 5 61   the error indeed happened on a production db with real data 
sure  wasn't sure how to deliver a sample application so here's an attached  zip file  i just generated this new app using  rails new stack_error  and added a file test integration simple_test rb    stack_error zip  https   github com rails rails files 1877802 stack_error zip     rails test 
hey  rafaelfranca  keoghpe i experimented a bit and was able to reproduce the issue with the given template   you see  i now think it's autoloader related  but tbh i don't know enough about the interna of rails autoloading to make an educated guess where exactly the problem is located  somehow the serialize call won't get into already autoloaded classes  once they're opened again    rails version    this time 5 2 0 final  as i updated last night    thanks for your quick and kind help 
hi  rafaelfranca  thanks for the prompt reply  sure  i will put together a pr suggesting some changes to the documentation  do you think it's worth examining whether the correct course of action might be to update the code to reflect the original author's intent and the intent of the existing docs  it seems to me that a more friendly upgrade path is one that provides equivalent methods for the old ar dirty methods  is there a reason we can't do this  thanks 
it works without    order id   asc     on both associations 
after some time uploading and deleting there would be hundreds or thousand empty directories  depending on usage  i don't know just would be cleaner i suppose 
sure  do i just add it into the 5 2 stable branch 
 rafaelfranca  i have sample application  here  https   github com wicky info sample 
see link in first line of issue 
 y yagi thank you for your reply  i'll make a sample application  asap 
sorry  i'm not good with wording  
i'll take a stab at it  but probably that's a bit too much for me  
 rafaelfranca i don't currently have a codebase in rails 5 to test this and it is not an option to migrate to it at this time  if it is not maintained  then i may just fork the latest rails 4 version and fix that  thanks 
edit  i begin to suspect postgres to be weird  since it looks the same from psql  but here is another example of it  notice how it jumps back to that magic number when offset is 0 again   old  actually the system is still up and the query still returns values in the range i showed in the example  i kind of suspect spring to be the reason it still has that same range as it had last time  but the problem itself is somewhere in the offset itself  also adding  order  some_attribute  does only return scattered 'unordered' ids but not a new offset starting from 0  all examples online show offset and limit as one way to page through the dataset  there is load on the database  i don't think postgres would return me the same weird range and also as you can see  the offset does indeed increase around 100_000 when i add it  when i omit it  the result stays at the fixed offset  order does not change things  edit  it does  but only if not queried with offset 0 afterwards  offset 0  returns the same ids as last time  order only changes the ids but also returns the same ids  when i omit order its back at the  900250  900251  900252  900253  900254  900255  900256  900257  900258  900259  
sure  updated the issue to include logging  as you can see  the table is being recreated without foreign key 
sure  here is the link for demo application   https   github com cis ankity demo_app
hi  y yagi   although ruby does track already loaded files  a system set up which includes a symlink to the application and its gems will cause a double require  when there is a symlink  the  __dir__  method of requiring  used  here  https   github com rails rails blob master activemodel lib active_model validations rb#l439   expands the symlink to the absolute path to the file  allowing it to bypass searching the   load_path  for the file and require it directly  this fully expanded path then gets added to  loaded_features  this conflicts with the requires done in  inclusion rb  and  exclusion rb  done  here  https   github com rails rails blob master activemodel lib active_model validations inclusion rb#l3  and  here  https   github com rails rails blob master activemodel lib active_model validations exclusion rb#l3   this is because those requires do not provide an absolute path to a file so ruby must first search the   load_path  for a path containing  active_model validations clusivity   the resulting path to  clusivity rb  does not contain the expanded symlink because the symlink is not expanded when the gem's lib path is added to   load_path   the difference between these required paths will cause ruby to require both even though they are the same file  this causes error_message to be initialized twice  resulting in the error we are seeing  because the error is so system dependent  it's difficult to provide an application which reproduces the issue but after inspecting the  load_path and  loaded_features it is clear this is where the issue lies 
 rafaelfranca no 
no   rafaelfranca  this error only occurs when i run my tests
thank you  rafaelfranca for the quick reply  i've opened the following issue  https   github com teamcapybara capybara issues 2142 however i'm guessing rails has tests on the output of its scaffold generators  including the generated system tests  have those tests picked up any problems   is there a boolean field in them  
i agree that the different behavior in console   server is odd  i've created a dummy app that replicates the issue  https   github com packerbacker89 pg_parameter_64k_issue i was unable to replicate the issue  however  using the template you provided 
it contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values and tables which i have to create  data can then be loaded with the rails db seed command  or created alongside the database with db setup   petercopter
i do have  config active_storage service    local  in  config environments development rb   i have the app in heroku  but there i don't have the setup for activestorage as  service  disk  of course  because heroku doesn't work like that 
dear k s a  that was the whole method  but  to make it clearer  i added the first line  def     and the last line  end  to the code above  it is a sub method of a controller method 
 fxn creating the reproduction case indicated that maybe there is a bug here but it is definitely different than what i thought it was  the failure to find the class here only occurs if i have a binding pry before the first mention of the class  so at the beginning of the seed file if i bind at   at that frame  referencing the class will throw the error  nameerror  uninitialized constant # class 0x000055eae5eb7d70   circulartolinearactuator  i'm assuming i should close this then  if you think that sounds like a valid separate bug i'd be happy to throw up a new issue for it  the issue of  zeitwerk  loader eager_load_all  failing also only occurs if run from a pry repl  again  not sure if that would be considered a bug or not or if that bug could be in pry  it is still very confusing when you see it 
 eileencodes i will research when it broke and which commit did the deed and whether it was oversight or well considered  i am happy to write the test cases as a pr  and also to submit a pr to change the behavior 
generate the following models 
thank you for investigating the issue 
i'll try that  also  clicking on install kdiff did nothing  no error  no progress  nothing  
git describe is a command that returns a string that identifies each commit relative to nearest annotated tag above it in it's history  i e  the tag is older than the commit being described   says that the current commit is one younger than the commit tagged "ver2 4 5" and has a hash of 8fe46bd    would like to see a line of say  describe  ver2 4 5 1 g8fe46bd after the  code commit hash   code  line on the commit tab on the main screen  we tend to use this output when describing which commit contains a bugfix  it is easier than just the has since the tag gives us a starting point for finding the commit 
i think this should be per machine because my favorite branches are not my colleges fav branches  if the settings will travel with the repo it will not be in the "sprite" of distributed system so much  how about adding it to the config file inside  git directory  it is the place that hold all my local branches  how about adding a line there like "fav true"  
i'm using 1 95 as well  i must add that when this problem occurs  an error is displayed in the list of remote repositories  the first item gets cleared and the second one says  "fatal  bad config file line 11 in  get config"  the problem also occurs when editing an existing remote 
2 41   net4 
the error persists one more point  if i set 'check settings at startup' flag it fires 'linux tools  sh  not found' error and empties 'path to linux tools' value at the next start despite i've set this setting to correct value previously  btw  i haven't msysgit path included in  path  variable 
the password is in the url string in the  gitmodules file example   submodule "somesubmodule"  path   somesubmodule url   https   miterosanguest crazypassworrd bitbucket org miterosan somesubmodule git
 spdr870 well  as you can see  this is a pre release version  you linked it in #550   before i was on 2 31 final  the issue persists even after a repair install   kindragon sorry  currently no screenshot  but i can give the top stack trace of the exception  could not load settings  system argumentexception  illegal characters in path  system io checkinvalidpathchars string path  system io ispathrooted string path  gitui mergetoolshelper findfileinfolders string filename  string   locations  gitui mergetoolshelper finddifftoolexefile string globaldifftooltext  string  exename  gitui fomrsettings difftoolcmdsuggest_click object sender  eventargs e      hope that helps 
confirmed  thanks for the fast response 
can i just reinstall 2 41 back over 2 43   
the left panel refers to the branches of a single repository  what i am talking about is something completely different  that is an overview of the status of all the repositories  plural  that are configured in the dashboard 
it just shows the whole content of the file as deleted  and then added again 
well  in blame view  file tree view and maybe others  places where for instance xml code is highlighted 
  issue1535  https   f cloud github com assets 2836207 60169 fa68adac 5bfd 11e2 8a30 05ca746c201e png  snapshot includes  from top to bottom  pull dialog  fetch command's dialog  my "after pull" event's pull dialog  and the about page for git ext 
i did that  and actually  i think it's a bug in github or something  when i'm on a certain branch  it's showing the random "pr ###" branches  but then on another branch  it isn't  i contacted github support to see what they say 
i wonder if the list supports arbitrary objects instead of text  then it could be just something with zero height 
i've applied changes locally  i mean both #5835 and #5854  and was able to run it  thanks 
i don't think that it is a good idea to break older version just like that  i am using version 3 just for testing because it is not quit usable for large repositories  and the other reason is that there is not yet stable release for v3  me suggestion for fixing this  1  add new favourite repositories format support from v3 to v2 2  v3 version works with both formats  when adding new favourite from v3  it will also add for v2  when loading v3  all v2 favourite repositories are checked and mismatch fixed in v3  personalty i would prefer first method  but this is only my opinion  maybe you can think something more appropriate 
the latest  3771d9d95500549d5d8963ef083ebdb1336f205b
yeah  that would seem to be a nice solution  to summarize you mean that the command  "context menu"    advanced    fixup would bring up the commit dialog  the commit dialog would be like the "ordinary" commit dialog but there would be a "commit   auto squash" button   maybe some ordinary buttons needs to be disabled   invisible  pressing the "commit   auto squash" would  behind the scenes  lead to 1  the files being committed 2  an interactive rebase being run which would fixup  meld  the commit into the selected commit yes that would be nice  +1  only that for me this would not be in the "advanced" sub menu as i do it a lot  but i could live with that    
they are the same 
yea  fedora 23  here is the current mono versions 
ah  i made a mistake  the message shows after you've staged the file  the preview works well  i'm using windows 10 and gitext 2 48 05 
 gitconfig is not in the folder 
i think that problem was not with git repository location but empty appsettings gitcommandvalue see pull request https   github com gitextensions gitextensions pull 3358

 jbialobr   that is the only easy for the devs to verify the remote url  making sure that they pull from or push to the correct repo  before they pull push their code from to remote repo

that returns the hash of the branch that i have checked out  _develop_  
i have used 2 49 03 for a week and zero issues  same git  same windows  same anti virus  symantec   now i have switched back to 2 51 04 and the issue popped up after some hours again  here is the command log after the issue happened    log  https   user images githubusercontent com 13408366 44850866 ded1e100 ac5e 11e8 95c4 0be5aada550e png   vbjay i tried but if i do your commands after the issue happened  it shows no difference  if i clone the project again  then the "not responding" issue does not happen  sorry i think i was wrong that it happens more often with fresh repositories  it happens just as well with existing ones 
thanks for the response  i will do as you said  create a branch and submit a pull request to master  if you are talking about after the fix applied  then    yes the dropdown stay open   any click closes the menu  whether one if its context menu or anywhere else 
thank you pmiossec  by disabling console emulator  i was able to perform the command as expected  this is a great workaround 
my knowledge about the code is none existing and at the moment i didn't find the time to work into it 
if one has the commit dialog open  and the original explorer window used to launch the commit dialog is gone  whats the fastest way for one to push using gitextensions  a simple toolbox icon to invoke push on the commit dialog it allows for this 
it may not be considered 'important'  but it's useful  that's why the 'git commit' command provide the '  date' argument  i'm looking farward to it because i'm not using git the "native" way  so i tend to conceal my use case  but  since git contains this option  it's not unconvincing that it's useful for "native" users too  is it  so  if you contributors kindly add this feature to git extensions  it is exciting news and git extensions becomes more powerful  if you don't plan to  git extensions is still an excellent git ui tool for me 
3 2 1 not sure whether i canreproduce but i can try
well    heres another bug 🤣  this is the log saved to a file     this is an image of the log instead  https   user images githubusercontent com 2033345 47566557 0faf5900 d924 11e8 950f cd1b0b30188e png 
looks like it's a duplicate of that one 
the title and description appear squashed in the commit view of the main window after this occurs    git extensions commitmsg1  https   user images githubusercontent com 2559153 49953758 6e289a80 fec4 11e8 8b33 01e8f0fa9fa4 png  they also appear squashed in the commit dialog after bringing the message up from the history drop down    git extensions commitmsg2  https   user images githubusercontent com 2559153 49953817 9adcb200 fec4 11e8 8bf8 aa5057b47a03 png  my changes go through gerrit for review as well  and the message appears less squashed there  but the blank line between the title and description is gone    git extensions commitmsg3  https   user images githubusercontent com 2559153 49953877 c19ae880 fec4 11e8 803e 87adf620c041 png  i have a commit hook that adds the change id seen in these images  which is not affected by this issue  but the change id line gets collapsed into the first line as well if i amend the commit 
i updated issue description  anyway when i build debug from current master and run it locally it is much faster  but it opens gitextensions repository directly instead of dashboard 
hi philippe  this is happening everytime when using gitextentions  when using visual studio 2017 2019  sourcetree and commandline  and powershell  prompt or even the console option in gitextentions it works  still happens after reinstalling git and gitextentions  even after a reboot  note  after killing the proces via the taskmanager i could  for a short moment  a bash console  i could not see what it said because the letters where very small and the console disappered very quickly

so     it's actually caused by  combobox's autocomplete implementation  https   referencesource microsoft com #system windows forms winforms managed system winforms combobox cs 741839591cce46ae  using a case insensitive autocomplete that uses the current text as a source  i'm working on a pr that could be used  overriding notifyautocomplete   i haven't finished testing it yet  and the side effects of such a change still need to be considered  i had the same thought  but the simple fix i thought i was going to make did not suffice  edit  expanding on what i said  i believe that the notfiyautocomplete occurs before it makes it to the suggested lines  i believe they would also need to be changed to allow actually saving the change  but it never gets that far since autocomplete sets the text back to the original casing 
here you go  tom  https   gist github com 976840 i hope this suffice 
if a new terminology needs to be introduced i'd prefer something more neutral and basic   site items  seems like a logical candidate  assuming that everything in jekyll is ultimately inside a collection or another  page  post  custom     
not sure  shouldn't this not be occurring on the current build though  edit  i'll install 3 0 0 and give it a go 
wow  go ahead and just close this  i was up a directory higher than i should have been  sorry for wasting your time 
rethorical question  goal here is to add a config field or more sensible default  feed uses excerpt naked and has opted not to adjust at this point  which increases the content in my web feeds approximately 30 40  per post 
 dirtyf the only thing i can think of right now is to list each member out separately  unless there's an alternative that isn't github's team listing
 pathawks per my original post   this page http   jekyllrb com docs configuration default lists "kramdown" as the markdown parser   i am requesting to change that to "commonmarkghpages" both in the documentation and in appropriate places in the actual code
i was able to track this down  the tags section was just empty   while one can leave out the "tags " this should not result in an error like this

hi i try to use full path and solve it    ' usr local ruby lib ruby gems 1 9 1 gems jekyll 0 10 0 lib jekyll migrators wordpress'  thank you 
i thought the issue is with jekyll rather than jekyll sitemap since only jekyll got updated 
unfortunately my only resolution at the moment is to revert to an older version of liquid  the reason i closed it is that it is a duplicate of  issue #422  https   github com mojombo jekyll issues 422   i didn't spot this when i opened it because of the default filter that was being applied 
sorry  i almost forgot about this  yes  i figured it out  see the accepted answer on the stack overflow question if you're curious 
i will follow the advice  go test the limits and report back  my observation from previous tries told me  the memory it requires in ram is roughly twice to three times the size of all the posts  in my case  if i process all the posts   247m  in one run  the ram usage shows by top command is 450mb 600mb and stay there  if the size of posts is 41m  then it takes 112m res ram

yep  i have solved this problem now cause i haven't add the rss meta on the top of the default html
 parkr what exactly do you mean 
i wonder what could be wrong here  this is tested with ruby 1 9 3_p448 and safe_yaml 0 9 7  tried also installing via gem  which gem influences this test 
how silly i am    i just figured out the easiest way    just execute  bin jekyll build  in the source  no need to install 
i means nested list can not embedded with code 
in fact  when i make this    jekyll makes the compilation without errors
i tried it  and the error had been appearance yet  let be    it's not matter    thanks for all reply 
 mattr  _site

 gummesson  thank you  but nope  the page folders that jekyll creates are not related to any template code  just to verify  though  i did delete all the template code in any layout and built  same issue  anywho  i use  page  there so the template values are passed into my includes  thank you for offering the tip though 
 parkr my system is  windows 7 ultimate sp1 64 bit   i use  git bash  as my console  python is  python27   ruby is  ruby 1 9 3 p448   the output of  which sh  is   bin sh  
well  thanks  i'll try again anyway and tell you about it 
the use case is for jekyll microblogging and progressively enhancing posts based on the presence of specific front matter  when posting short titleless notes having the option to decouple the  title   front matter field from the  titleified  slug from the filename would be convent because it allows one to check if the post has a title field specified in the post front matter or not  for example in the post layout   this sets the title of the page to something a bit more informative than the file name for a titleless short note  the file name is still important because it determines the slug of the post  right now  this liquid only works if i set  title  null  on every post that does not specifically have a title  by default  all posts have a  title  value because they are automatically assigned one based on the file name  unless overridden in front matter   afaict the point of defaults is to avoid repetition in the front matter of post files which is what this change would allow for in this use case 
it wouldn't replace the normal way of placing front matter  it would extend it  if the file has front matter  it would use that  if there's a separate  metadata file  jekyll would read that and attach that metadata to the file  if there's neither  it would do what it currently does with metdata less files  i e   nothing   the advantage is that it allows files to be sourced by both jekyll and other systems with incompatible metadata  currently  if you run a jekyll  md file through pandoc  pandoc will read the yaml front matter as a weirdly formatted paragraph in between horizontal rules  and potentially mangle the start of the file  so currently  while the yaml frontmatter is _simple_  it doesn't play well with others   there's no easy way of separating the jekyll specific information from the content that might be useful to another system  this would theoretically also lay the groundwork for jekyll or jekyll plugins to change how it handles files other than  md  for example  you could attach metadata to css files to programatically generate which css files are sourced by a particular html file with a tag plugin  or attach a caption as metadata to images and have a plugin that generates captioned image divs   c  the suggestion doesn't strictly include this  but if done in the right way  the feature could allow for multiple files to read the same metadata   e g   a  _posts metadata  file could merge its metadata to all files in _posts  with the basic metadata variables that jekyll looks for  this isn't very useful  but when you have a more complicated set of metadata determining how content is generated  it might be a convenience feature 
 parkr i'm a little confused  are you asking me  also  does github pages currently support changing the parser to kramdown  if yes  so  i'm fine with it and this issue could be closed anyway  except if anyone is interested in islands of non processed input in other parsers 
deleting stale and inactive branches is just like cleaning your house  you don't have to do it every day  you don't even have to do it at all  but after some time it gets too messy and you realize you actually have to do it  also  it's less objects and deltas to download   package   chart_with_upwards_trend 
both render the drafts  no error is thrown 
you are right  it’s already possible to move posts into sub folders  but this pattern is not obvious for most users  i’ve never seen its usage in the wild  and as  envygeeks pointed out  sub folders trigger categories creation  my proposal is a long term goal  busy jekyll users  often than monthly  like rails boys or  benbalter will write a lot in the next years  i don’t want to distract them by a huge amount of own posts every time they open the posts folder 
hi  zachgersh  here is sreenshot of my gem list   screen shot 2013 07 03 at 10 37 55 pm  https   f cloud github com assets 2520187 744189 c35136e6 e3f6 11e2 9356 920039edf338 png   mattr  i've searching around for older version of safe_yaml and gogle point me to https   github com dtao safe_yaml releases  i found 0 7 1 version but don't know how to install it  i'm very very new user 
that works  though the reason i tried switching to redcarpet was because my code blocks are not being parsed  they are coming out on the page like this    screen shot 2013 09 12 at 23 27 03  https   f cloud github com assets 1926747 1134497 1d33553a 1bf2 11e3 8ae2 b83118f08dfd png  do i have to specify i want support for liquid tags 
 parkr afraid not  as the 'thread pool' error occurs before the choice of adapter  in this case  wdm  once that gem is installed  is even made  good news is i actually just managed to 'get it working' by hacking in a call to  celluloid boot   as suggested in that sidekiq thread   but i'm currently adding that call into listen itself  which seems unlikely to be the right solution  i wouldn't have thought monkey patching it in from jekyll is the best idea either  though possible i suppose  i'm now digging into listen a bit  trying the basic examples etc  to see what does and doesn't work  i will keep you updated 
thanks for your feedback   parkr the use case is the following  in my  index html  i am looping through all my posts to display them as a list of posts  some of these posts are meant to be posts with a category and a published on date  other posts still fit a category but are more of a general form that i upgrade from time to time  they are a bit like project pages and thus giving them a url based on a published date does not make a lot of sense  therefore the request for a  permalink    categories  title   as  penibelst noted  i could create a page for these type of posts but then i cannot display them in my list of posts in  index html   i hope it is now more clear

i do not have the fixed version nor do i have any version of wdm installed  i'm not changing the default behavior of jekyll or listen currently     force_polling  doesn't change the behavior here   i can get a little bit more precise with my other issue  i change a line in a blog post and changes are applied when refreshing the page for the post  but not when refreshing the blog index page 
it seems inflexible that both pages and posts should be subject to the same styling rules  in most cases  this is good because it makes the styles consistent  but at the same time it makes it less flexible to customization  this is an easy thing to change during customization though  so perhaps i have gone too far in bringing this up as an issue  on may 25  2014 1 28 pm  "philipp rudloff" notifications github com wrote

 axelvoitier i solved this problem after upgrading my system to 10 9 4 with ruby to 2 1 2 and jekyll 2 2 0 
sure  here's an example  build warning  layout 'review' requested in _posts reviews 2013 03 06 the boxing girls of kabul md does not exist  in my _layouts directory  i have review html   and the site builds using the requested layout  does the layout specified in the frontmatter need to have " html" in it as well 
that's exactly was what i was saying  tnx for mentioning this  pathawks
 parkr  asset data url  is useful if you want to avoid multiple requests to the server  it automatically converts images to base64 string 
if there should be only 1 site header page content site footer then it is semantically more correct to have them as id  the benefit appears when using javascript   getelementsbyclassname    returns an array vs  getelementbyid    returns directly the dom element  or null  
 kleinfreund sorry  forgot the backticks  i've switched back to kramdown as i was using redcarpet and that's resolved the issue  thank you 
there does not seem to be a rhyme or reason to the order of the file being deleted  there are a mix of  pdf   zip   jpg   png in the symlinked directory in question  the files that were deleted  6 in total  from 6 different build attempts  are all  pdf files but they were not deleted in alphabetical nor size order  nor in the order that they appear in the file where they are referenced  i'm using jekyll 2 2 0  by the way 
i don't know what _site had to do with it in my case  had exclude    spec and no folder containing substring 'spec" refreshes when you save an article within it  change to   spec    and it works as one would have expected  the match is surely over aggressive  note this is file watch only  the pages are all rendered properly  it's just that regeneration is not triggered 
unfortunately no  any ideas on how i can get some behavior like this  every few weeks i'll be adding new countries  so i'll see more things like fr books  sp books
hi parkr  here is my stack trace 
great  it was me doing a dumb 'replace all' on colons in the body  but this screwed up the yaml  thanks for your help  +1 
sure  envygeeks  i have this chunk in my markdown file 
exact steps  opening a terminal windows in my project root and typing in 'jekyll serve'  parkr running  bundle exec jekyll serve  worked  any idea why 
just gave it a shot  and worked as expected  thanks for taking a look 
 envygeeks possibly  i'm not sure whether it's the same underlying problem or merely a similar symptom with a different cause 
something like would make it unambiguous  regardless  thx for clarifying 
 envygeeks assign will accept other assigned variables  and perhaps other things   but not include params 
 envygeeks this is a tail of strace   and nothing else 
it only affects posts  documents and pages are okay  i went through the code base roughly  it maybe not an easy fix  the code is using  utils slugify  to generate post file's metadata  permalink  or  title  in pre process phase  the permalink is already finalized  we can't easily pass any optional parameter to determine whether to lowercase the title  i'm not a ruby guy  correct me if i'm wrong 
ok  it looks like it's a timing issue  i can't replicate the issue with just running  jekyll build   watch  by it's self  it seems that creating the output files in a directory that jekyll is watching is causing jekyll to run with them before they have finished being created updated  so it ends up making empty files in the build directory  still  it would be reasonable to think anyone doing something similar with gulp or grunt might be experiencing the same issue 
happened again with the  _config yml  change  i  ack 'd through my repo and couldn't find any of those and don't see why i would have any non english characters in the imports  also  it says it's occurring here in the  styles scss  file 
thanks for catching that  i replaced  page excerpted  to  page excerpt  and it sort of worked  i had to use this method to differentiate between full posts and posts with excerpts  http   www seanbuscay com blog jekyll teaser pager and read more   no idea why that bit worked for jekyll 2 x though  thanks for your help

 parkr i'm sorry to inform you that  as of this date  i don't know ruby at all 
thanks for the response   parkr  i guess the short answer is "i can't"  i don't believe 80  of users would use it  nevertheless  here are my own reasons for finding this worthwhile    for the 10  of cases  i don't think there's currently an easy way to combine the     highlight     with a   figcaption     i might be mistaken    am i    i would not have started the fork if i knew of an easier way to add a   figcaption   inside the highlighted   figure     this would only be an optional argument   very much like a   figcaption   is optional within a   figure     even if people don't use it  they often   should     a filename above a block of code clarifies a lot and does not require additional introduction in the surrounding text   this improves understandability of articles significantly  "wait so where do i put this code  oh it says right here "

it allows inheriting the property from the parent layout  for example  in  default   in this case  by traversing the layout up  we can display all the widgets that are defined by the parent  as well as the current layout  i find it enriches the modularity of the template layouts and also help to envision the relation between layouts to be inheritance as in typical oo world

 dirtyf yes i am the author of the jekyll paginate v2  you're more than welcome to include it in plugin core if you think it is good enough  i would welcome more feedback and new contributors  re  the message  it obviously was added for a good reason and i'm all for retaining it while it is useful for the majority of the user base  if it is only intended for github pages though  would it make sense to have a test in there to detect that platform and only print the error then 
it is a good question  since my jekyll folder does not even have any kind of css  or sass scss etc   files  i have something like this  src ├── jekyll │ ├── _includes │ ├── _layouts └── sass ├── main sass and the output is  assets ├── css │ └── main css    generated by gulp js  the one i need └── main css    generated by jekyll serve command  i do not need it  nothing in this file was written by me

 briandiggs  that would probably be sufficient  yeah  needs to be fairly prominent though

yes  that would be the ideal  i think  i was just being conservative for the sake of backward compatibility  ps  if you think it's a worthwhile addition  i can send a pr 
this fails with an error message   howver  if we uncomment the line containing  sys date    then it works  the problem seems to be that ggplot2 passes a vector containing some na components to the  lab  function and one must provide a valid label for them  even though ggplot2 never uses those labels   ggplot2 should not pass these na values to the label function 
yes there are definitely some workarounds and not sure if this is really a bug but it is somewhat weird  though very  r   behavior  to me  the  width  solution is less appealing than the ymin   prop     prop    solution 
the arguments for  facet_wrap  are presently a combination of scale and label customizations  i think  scale_panel  would adopt    nrow  ncol   scales   shrink   as table   drop   dir and  panellab   a al xlab  ylab  would get   labeller   switch   strip position but i admit  i am fuzzy on the general principle of  scale_   functions

thanks for your reply  and sorry for this late reply  i think that i may not ask a right question  i have noticed the lack of any scale for geometry mapping  dose it make sense that create a scale for geometry  like "scale_geometry_identity"  i know it is useless to draw the main plot  but it would be helpful to draw the legend of geom_sf layer  especially when there are multiple layers in the plot  map    clauswilke
seems to work  my guess is that this commit fixes it https   github com tidyverse ggplot2 commit 5e6b1e5daa1599661bf5841353a067e9eee88161  eval_facets    returns the following  rather than the 0 row 0 col tibble from before
this turned out to be an imagemagick problem  sorry to bother you guys 
thanks 
the image download in the browser worked fine from my bucket  while uploading a file didnt work as soon as i switched to 2 5 0 and aws sdk  when reverting to 2 4 5  it immidiately worked again  sorry i dont have the stack trace anymore  is there any configuration change necessary when switching to 2 5 0  the only change i did was changing the gem file to latest paperclip and added the aws sdk gem  i had googled for the issue and some other folks had the same problem and recommended deinstalling aws s3 for incompability issues with aws sdk  but it didnt fix it on my machine  i will try migrating to 2 5 0 with my next build and then i will post the full trace 
in logs i don't see anything  chrome just doesn't load a file  using firefox i see in logs that it is uploaded  anyway i tried it but it doesn't work  i think it's chrome problem  but who knows   
i don't unfortunately   let me know if you find it 
never executed tests for gems  is that the correct command  the tests pass  however in my rails environment i needed to remove the  0 's or else the uploads would fail with the error above  i have executed tests against original and modified version  result is same   pre  togg life ends    gem ruby 1 9 1 gems paperclip 2 4 5 orig   ruby  i test test paperclip_test rb testing against version 3 1 3 debugger disabled run options  # running tests                                                  finished tests in 2 430836s  19 3349 tests s  25 9170 assertions s  47 tests  63 assertions  0 failures  0 errors  0 skips   pre

no  i didn't overwrite anything manually  at least not intentionally  possibly via monkey patch  i'll check    here's how my paperclip is configured 
i realize csv imports are best left as a worker process  but for the size of data we're dealing with right now this works  i use the same code for either of the callbacks
thanks for the help  i attached the codes in you email box 
oh   sikachu i'm sorry  i was mistaken  this was not the actual file  the file was different  using simple form_for and adding mutipart  true to that form solved the problem  i'm sorry i did not close this issue immediately  thank you 
sorry  i just found the email notification of your response in my inbox    i took up this problem yesterday  and found the cause of the error    it was an old initializer in the rails app that fix some tempfile old problems  i guess   now everything is ok  i'll close the issue  thanks a lot 
i have  locatable  concern in  app models concerns   i think first time its loaded in  environment  task via  require 'locatable'  in  const_missing   but here https   github com thoughtbot paperclip blob master lib tasks paperclip rake#l80 it is loaded again via  require "# rails root  app models concerns locatable' rb"   so caching for  require  doesn't work  i patched this task removing this line  and everything works fine in production environment because of eager loading  here's trace of original task 
i made it work in development env  however  it failed to upload in production env  i am still searching for answers 
working variant
i solved it  the problem was i added it the fingerprint for the attachments long after i added the attachments  but didn't set a default value so every attachment that was created before i added the fingerprint had a nil fingerprint and that is why this error was happening

i don't think it will be hard at all  however i used the aws s3 patch that i linked above for the time being
thanks for the input
yes  that's how i thought it should work    
thanks for the quick reply  i will check with the option you have mentioned  didn´t know there is such a new option  but i agree  i think the default should be to not delete previously files because otherwise this option is pretty destructive for a default one  i will ping in this thread if the option workes out for me or take a look at a new pull request 
i just say that if images for fallback are in the folder app assets images fallback they are not displayed in production environment will create a demo a little later
i will try and get to this in the next few days 
sorry for the late response  but the issue occurred when i tried to delete the image after it was set  it seemed like it was deleting the actual image off of the cdn first   then throwing an error when trying to remove the relationship between the image and the object  i am using active record if that helps  i got around this issue by creating a separate model for my upload and deleting the entire object opposed to just the image relationship from the object  if i get some time later this week i will try to recreate the issue in a small demo app 
i think i don't really understand the padrino boot sequence very well  or maybe i need to understand the functionality of bundler better  assuming that "gem carrierwave" appears _after_ "gem padrino" in the gemfile  then this will work fine   the first line requires the uploader  which doesn't happen by default  the second line requires activerecord  swap for another orm as necessary  the last line properly sets the carrierwave root  so you won't have inexplicable explosions when you actually try to use your uploader

i should have said 'mountable' rather than 'standalone' engine  but anyway  the main point is the engine has an isolated name space to avoid collisions with other engines by placing all classes inside a module  see  http   stackoverflow com questions 6118905 rails 3 1 engine vs mountable app the modifications the rails generators make when generating code for a mountable engine is twofold  1  they place generated classes in app artifact_type engine_name whatever_file rb  and 2  place the class definition inside a module i will be happy to do a pull request  tho i'm newbie to git so i will take some time  googling for this issue didn't turn up any results so maybe i'm the lucky first so if you're ok to wait  i'll submit within a week

the  #save  returns true even if the object didn't changed  check this output   just reinforcing  i would like to know when a file changed   doesn't need to be using  #changed   or  #save  
yes i can provide some context  i've a  controller  where a  param  specifies which file this action should use  for example   when  params  file   is  nil  or  empty  it tries to read the directory  however the ruby  file exists  file   also returns  true  for a directory  so it might be more logical to add the  file file  file   method to  sanitizedfile  
i updated the filenames in the first post  in fact i generate random filenames  when a file is fetched  i just wanted to simplify the example a bit  not overriding the filename in picturesuploader  i tested the code and it yields the above result 
we'd maintain only  en  locales in the main repo  and all the translations moved to a separate project with separate  and faster specs   easier contributions and an independent release cycle  we could also add tests for consistency across translations  currently broken   users of  carrierwave  who might need additional locales could either add  carrierwave i18n  gem or simply copy paste the needed locales to their applications 
 daniel g  it worked fine for that situation but will store wrongly incase i reload model  user  
i did  but it was just a trace of the templates rendered that led to the access of the image  but it's an error that occurs regardless of where i access that image  i think i may have messed something up in all honesty  when i removed the call to the avatar  there was a simillar error in my serializer

that reminds me of another question i brought up previously  maybe requires a separate issue  the view page displays "subjects"  the edit form says add "tags" these are not necessarily the same thing  a subject is specifically what a work is about  a tag is far more general and invites tags for genres  and looser associations  those tags are useful  but what a work is is different from what it's about  should there be a subject field with structured taxonomy and a separate tags field with unstructured folksonomy  and would it be possible to filter by a combination  it would be useful to sort by two tags  i e  subject and fiction  eliminating the need for all the "subject in fiction" tags 
yes  we will need to write the tests  if i describe it  i would say we use a node js test framework  mocha for instance  write down our selenium tests  integrate it with travis  just need to provide access key   and that will pretty much do the work  i have not seen the current testing environment here in the codebase yet so if we are using some other framework for testing that will do as well  the important point is to write tests with selenium and integrate our browserstack with travis 
good questions  here's my example in the open library  https   openlibrary org books ol27305075m all_of_science  i had no place to put 'printed'  so i just had to put it alongside the publisher  that creates confusion  the reasons i would say we would need to add the printer  in addition to the publisher is  1  people could get confused when looking at the copyright section of a book as to who's the publisher and who's the printer  2  as seen in the example  books get reprinted  so that's important too  so that's another bit of information  in addition to printer and city  the reason is that knowing that something's reprinted relates to copyrights   and whether a book's out of print or not  should it be under publisher or printer  if a book's just printed without a publisher  wouldn't it say 'self published' in the publisher section  or  maybe it could be blank  who publishes is  i believe  quite complicated sometimes  in general  whatever people know gets filled in  so if people know the printer  but not the publisher  that gets filled in and vice versa  how does it affect the ability to search by publisher  it's going to be more accurate  as now instead of unavoidably added a printer to the publisher section  it gets its own section  so if people can't find what they need to by publisher  they find the book by printer  so the info doesn't go away  just switches to another category  how do we categorize each example  if the first example is the printer  then add that info to that section and likewise for the other example  the only thing is that when adding a book  adding the publisher publication date should not be a requirement  instead  we would need new identifiers  i would suggest the copyright date and having either a printer or publisher to add the new book in

alright  hope my story won't be long  after downloading the zip  i only unzipped it  found the cmakelists txt file  and replaced it with the one that was in the openbabel 2 3 1 directory  which i built yesterday   then i ran the program  autodock covalent  which uses pybel   openbabel  the output you see is right after i ran this program  originally  i installed the openbabel 2 3 1  installed the python bindings  ran setup py in the openbabel 2 3 1 python directory and also installed eigen2 and copied its directory to  usr include  everything seemed fine until i bumped into this dlfcn problem  that's when i saw the new cmakelists txt on the github page and only replaced it with the one that is already in openbabel 2 3 1 directory  at this stage  i did not install anything new  i ran the program again  and the same error happened  when i reported this  you provided the openbabel master package and again didn't install anything  just replaced the cmakelists txt file in that package with the one in the openbabel 2 3 1 folder  maybe i should install the openbabel with the new package you provided all over again  thanks

hi keenan  thanks for the tip  yes  cloning the node before adding it fixed the problem  was the problem my fault  "nodes are supposed to be cloned before added to other documents"  but i cannot find any reference to this in the nokogiri documentation  or a bug in nokogiri  what about the depth of the cloning  when using the default depth is not enough 
i did not provide them 
just tried it    and it is the same problem  the problem is not specific to os x either 
thank you for your confirmation  i change nothing  but it is working when i try it today   it was not working yet when  flavorjones  commented  https   github com sparklemotion nokogiri issues 1541#issuecomment 251383008   😕  
yes  with utf 8 it works  the issue is that i'm processing 3rd party html and some developers are really creative when setting their charset    at nokogiri level  is there anything that i can do to make the same gem version behave equally in linux and os x 
yes same thing happens with 1 6 8 rc3  i probably should have mentioned that in the original issue  i just backtracked through the versions to determine where it broke 
ok  here it goes  to reproduce it you can use docker  dockerfile

hi   flavorjones and  flavorjones   thanks for your time in advance  1  what problems are you experiencing  we have one production server and it is working with xml mostly  we generate xml from hash array and also parse xml string into xml document using nokogiri  what i am facing with  is that nokogiri is eating 80mb of ram to generate 5mb and memory won't be release  so our server needs to restart often  2  i am using nokogiri version 1 7 2 3  script  orgs array contains more than 8000 elements  looking for your response
 flavorjones thanks for helping me out  when i do gem install nokogiri   platform java it installs well  however  i thought that for jruby i need to use jgem  am i getting confused  after i use that command to install nokogiri  when i try to run my ruby program that needs the gem  i get this 
the example is a different language  it shows the advantage though  https   jsfiddle net  the jquery api is very easy to test online  it gives a big advantage for projects like cheeriojs compared to nokogiri  another example along the same lines  https   npm runkit com npm
 flavorjones the reason you weren't able to reproduce the issue is supposedly owing to alpine linux 3 11 release  i've updated the original post  please try again  the trick to reproduce the issue is to have the system  libxml2  of a different version than the one that comes with  nokogiri    nokogiri 1 10 7  comes with   libxml2 2 9 10   2    then requiring  rmagick   which is dynamically linked to  libxml2   loads the system version  as a result  nokogiri  is bound to use the loaded system library  not the one it was built against  so  it complains  resolving this issue will supposedly eliminate the ability of other gems to force  nokogiri  to use the system  libxml2   and the need to  check  1  the  libxml2  version for that matter   p s  i'm not a c programmer  but the guy on stack overflow says the way it works now is incorrect wrong   1   https   github com sparklemotion nokogiri blob v1 10 7 lib nokogiri version rb#l40  2   https   github com sparklemotion nokogiri blob v1 10 7 dependencies yml#l2
here you have all documented info about extendscript http   download macromedia com pub developer aftereffects scripting javascript tools guide cc pdf i have used js beautify for years with this language without problem except now with the #include
i honestly don't know how it was produced  it comes from a site that was linked to by a spammer in the comments on my website  my link scanner automatically detected and flagged it as suspicious  i just assumed the script was made using a standard p a c k e r script 
this is only an enhancement purpose  the script works but i think the api could be better  my suggestion is right above

a checkbox on http   jsbeautifier org that replaces all variable with long ish word  img width "609" alt "screen shot 2016 06 13 at 11 33 39" src "https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1148376 16002974 b78d94d0 315a 11e6 8f8d 18e3ca36d7ef png" 
forgive my pool english  cry  when i run the cli with   r  flag  it will display all the files passed to the cli  such as i have some files
sure  this is input  which is also the expected output  was the output of previous version  
please excuse me  i actually wanted to post this issue in a  different repository  https   github com drewhamlett brackets beautify  
my indent setting was 4 spaces  and i just noticed this option    screen shot 2015 04 10 at 10 23 11 am  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4411118 7093154 a2e3c4b0 df6b 11e4 8302 c08b9948e567 png  which unfortunately also indents only the first line of the html markup 
the problem is simple  my file on atom starts out with crlf line endings  after atom beautify  the files have lf endings  this is unacceptable  that's it   no more  no less  but i don't know where the problem lies  is js beautify failing to even consider the line endings already existing  or does the problem lie with atom beautify not telling js beautify which line ending style to use  i find it curious that komodo's beautify js plugin does not suffer from this problem 
#421 covers quite a bit more than i would be looking for in terms of the comments in javascript files  though it would cover it and the rest would certainly be useful  that aside  there is no mention of the strings being split  maybe another option specifying max string length to add to that list would suffice  would you prefer that i move the commentary over to that thread and close this one out 
this is our  jsbeautifyrc  if that helps  we are using grunt jsbeautifier
after enable automatically format when a file is saved 
this is not one item specification  is a combination of  promise    class  and  keywords   the syntax for declaring classes and objects allows you to use reserved words as function names within definition the object or class  for example  here this code is also valid   but according to the specification  code must remain unchanged after beautification  promise catch  http   www ecma international org ecma 262 6 0 index html#sec promise prototype catch reserved word  http   www ecma international org ecma 262 6 0 index html#sec keywords class  http   www ecma international org ecma 262 6 0 index html#sec class definitions objects  http   www ecma international org ecma 262 6 0 index html#sec objects
surprisingly is that the error is not reproducible on the same pages  but still happens now and then for different pages  js beautify v1 6 3 is used by express beautify 0 1 3 so i can't directly influence the version of js beautify i use  still the fix seems simple  just surround the statement in question with if       guards   i applied this fix by hand and my webserver stopped crashing  but ofc it would be better to have it in the upstream 
sorry for the fuss    i'm using vscode and there was some collision between the internal beautifier and the plugin   
the rest of the file uses tabs but right now wrapping parameters use spaces instead of tabs  i'll create another issue for the second point  on nov 27  2017 2 43 pm  "liam newman"  notifications github com  wrote

from  tpope vim pathogen  https   github com tpope vim pathogen   pathogen uses  git  repositories to manage vim plugins  typically  users will manage their entire vim config using  git   adding plugins as  git  submodules  see  my vim config  https   github com tlvince vim config  as an example   a nice side effect is updates can be synchronised trivially using   in this case  the entire ledger repository would be cloned as a submodule when we're only interested in the vim components  pathogen also expects the plugin to be in the top level of the submodule directory

thanks for your help  i just pushed this up to github and tagged this commit point  see https   github com stevecj headway tree jasmine issue 505

i can make one and upload  can it depend on the operating system  it is win7 x64

i'm using  2 0 0    latest version included in  karma jasmine 2_0   if the expect is called outside  currentspec   then it should be some timeout issue  thanks for the tip though  i'll check our asynchronous specs and any other possibly offending construct 
example 
 wyuenho  good point  it shouldn't even exist in that package unless it were to be altered to support node specifically 
yep  that helps  now i'll can see why the spec failed  thanks  +1  and overriding the stack property  or actually having one one in the first  place is something i'll suggest to the peg js maintainer   screenshot from 2014 07 28 12 34 45  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 927609 3719413 0bfac874 1643 11e4 996b b4e26188e93b png

looks like it might  is there a public api which can be used to retrieve spec suite ids  i didn't find information in the documentation about that parameter for  execute   did i miss it or has it not been documented 
we had this issue by using the jasmine sbt plugin  https   github com joescii sbt jasmine plugin i just checked the require code and it seems the plugin relies on jasmine 2 0 3 so maybe that is the problem there  i will create an issue there  maybe they can upgrade their dependency 
awesome  i did eventually get it going  jsdelivr should make it even easier  though  thanks 
my apologies   this is happening in phantomjs  1 9 8 running with karma   no overwriting of  console log    as far as i can tell 
so is there any other way to do it

i found out the membership search problem with version 3 0 17 on centos 8  and then i read the main branch source code  i guess the behavior of the following code need to change to dynamically generate  " s ldap userdn"  inst  name  attribute name  this will be a breaking change because the attribute name is referenced in membership_filter of ldap instance configuration  src modules rlm_ldap user c line 42    retrieves the dn of a user and adds it to the control list as ldap userdn  will also retrieve any      attributes passed and return the result in  result  line 199  mem pair_update_control  vp  attr_ldap_userdn     0   fr_pair_value_strcpy vp  dn

tested on centos 6 5 and 7  python 2 6 6  on centos 6 5  and python 2 7 5  on centos 7   apache web server in both cases  version 2 2 15 on centos 6 5 and version 2 4 6 on centos 7   on both machines trying to run two web2py instances with web2py 2 9 12 gave the same result  the first acessed address worked and continued to work while the second accessed address resulted in web2py crashing with the above message  on both machines reverting to web2py version 2 4 5 temporarily solved the problem  i have also tried with web2py versions higher that 2 4 but i got the same error 
done   thanks ilvalle by the way   why we don't see an activity in web2py irc channel   also uservioce ideas requests are not used
sqlform behaves the same  if i am commenting all the fields from the model that have a is_in_db requirement the form is generated  it worked ok with 2 9 12   i'll give an example of such fields   i'll test now with other backends 
i replaced gluon packages dal with master of https   github com web2py pydal yes  its fixed  it would be great to have in web2py  thank you 
maybe i missed the point  what i'm trying do is to render my grids all together and ajax false seems to be the way to go    but   simply changing ajax false doesn't work  is that the designed behaviour  anyway filtering args as you suggested  grid   sqlform grid q  args request args  1   formname 't s'   idparent  raise the same exception 
wasn't much more too it   basically if i put that line in model file then it gave me the error when validating the login form  however i have pulled down latest version as of today with the auth refactor and problem no longer recurrs so closed the issue
i'm afraid i don't understand  what do you mean 
request vars is an empty storage object  there can't be a typo because i'm running the same code with python 2 7 and python 3 5  it works fine when using python 2 7
there are some files in local  database folder  like a local cache right   these files constantly changes over time and that leads to errors such as “insecure string pickle” when several ppl use local web2py process but with connection to production database 
i am using python 2 7 while my live server is working fine  https   jupiter midnight30 com jupiter articles call json org_info jupiter_id ao this test server  with the latest web2py https   jupiter7357 midnight30 com jupiter articles call json articles org_info jupiter_id ao fails because my function in controllers articles py doesn't declare any arguments   articles_service json def org_info        now  i could add 'jupiter_id' as an argument to the org_info   function and it'll then work on the latest web2py but a  what changed  and b  if i post to a function i get the same behaviour  ie works on "old" live code but not on "new" test code  but as its a post i don't have an argument to add to that function and so am stuck  on sun  3 mar 2019 at 21 45  mdipierro  notifications github com  wrote     carl hunter roach bisham barn owl group  http   bishambarnowlgroup blogspot com   runnymede ringing group  https   www runnymederinging uk   founder of midnight 30  https   midnight30 com  download great careers app  https   itunes apple com us app great careers job search on your side id977007868 ls 1 mt 8  jobs at great companies you can commute to 
oh my gosh  it should have been a combination or suguestion   
sure i'll have a look
what would it take to make it work  can we ask #neo4j for a method for this  destroying and recreating a new relationship under the hood transparently would be a pretty bad idea    where is start_node  used now  does it need to exist  private and or exception sound like a good answer

 cheerfulstoic thank you for the naming suggestion  but i'm a little bit confused  are you suggesting to change the association direction  it's only a semantic detail  by my point of view  saying that a user owns a post and post is_owned_by a user seems more expressive than user things_owned a post and a post has owner a user  what do you think   subvertallchris   what is your opinion here  by the way  i must learn to close opened issue when solved  sorry    
well  i'm having some strange behaviours like the one above  i restarted the machine and that error disappeared  but  i added the latest part of the query and the result was not as expected  without raising exceptions   the difference is in the  where  i r object    i_r_object     why the parameter name in the first query includes the initial  i    if i remove the initial i  it succeeded  2 options  1  my fault in the query or 2  an error in the parm name generator 
sure  in the mean time it can be reprod by simply doing the following anyobject find  name    "any text"  #returns nil without error  since it does not exist in the db  anyobject create  name    "any text"  anyobject find  name    "any text"  #errors out
for the following yml
yes  name and email property is defined in user model  but when i pass params object into new method  its initialize params with empty hash  why  
ok i thought it was still in place  so we use create_rel instaed   if this is consistent  should i add a section "how we add undeclared rels" to the wiki here  https   github com andreasronge neo4j wiki neo4j v3 declared relationships
   rake neo4j install edition env  
actually  yes  as a new user of the api i was expecting where and rel_where to accept the same parameter changing only their underlying context node and relationship  respectively   i think rel_like would be a better name here because what you are sending as parameter is an example of what you expect
in my case  i have several relations between same object with same properties  e g  two records for '4 sep'  student1   visited  date  '1 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '2 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '4 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '4 sep'     math  need to remove 1 specific record  okay  now developer can add unique index to date  though it is sort of headache  and what if business logic actually allows to visit lesson two times a day  morning evening  this is   not mandatory   to work with relations in each app architecture  but it often happens  another example is some roles like this   john   repairer    bike's garage   john   senior repairer    car's garage   john   manager    car's garage  yes  on web form of relationship management we can add logic  which will filter by 1  person id 2  place id 3  role name this is instead of simple search by role id  this adds certain headache to developer  how should i filter  if +filter by role name will be enough  or need to see if there is another properties  customer told  that there might appear role ranks   1  5   how it will reflect on business logic later  gosh   instead of simple search by role id    and ruby by itself is designed to save developer from headaches  what is required in described examples  is  match     r   uuid   rel_uuid         return r and if relationships will be indexed   nothing scary in such request  it will be probably even more efficient  than 1  lookup through nodes a  2  then through nodes b  3  and then find relations between them yes  they cannot be indexed by schema index  strange why  though maybe it will be implemented in future in neo4j   though legacy indexes and auto indexes allow to index relationships  http   neo4j com docs stable auto indexing html http   neo4j com docs stable indexing relationships html maybe it is not easy to implement in neo4jrb now and schema indexes preferable  but except technical issues i don't see for now why relationship ids aren't desirable  why neo4jrb should prevent usage of intuitive convenient logic
ah  sorry  destroy  works  i was confused by old docs  https   github com neo4jrb neo4j wiki neo4j  rails persistence#destroy and delete and wasn't able to find in new docs how to delete records 
yes  it can wait  i was planning to work on a feature i'm building using active job sometime early next week 
thanks brian  actually i was able to solve the issue by using  as a default fallback message in my  code en yml  code  file   after reading the other thread comments decided to post it here in case the recommended fix makes sense  i e  however i'm aware that both devise   simple_form are plataformatec's gems and thus very tied to active record  please close the issue if the fix doesn't make sense for neo4jrb   in any case i'll be doing some tests with formtastic in order to review if it's better suited for activenode  can you please point to some   emberjs   examples  
hi  not sure how to do that  the only eager loading documentation i was able to found is http   neo4jrb readthedocs org en latest activenode html#eager loading but it seems on per request bases  cheers  david
yes i included the concern after the neo4j  activenode  but anyway  thanks to  subvertallchris  you solution worked perfectly   y 
hi brain  the returning method works with the count as strength  which orders the highest correlating users  but i'm having troubling accessing the enumerable after the return  trying to figure the best way to deal with the problem  most likely some kind of map method from neo4j core  on tue  jul 14  2015 at 12 51 pm  brian underwood notifications github com wrote 
ok  i'v changed the version  i've tested more versions before posting and forget to change back   i've changed the config neo4j session_path to 'http   localhost 7474' instead the local ip and now it works  thanks for the quick response 
you were absolutely right  it was this line  passing symbols solved the issue  i think we should update the documentation  https   github com neo4jrb neo4j wiki neo4j 3a 3aactivenode
hi  progm thanks   this is what we were using   do you think we are in the clear to make the switch to the new branch 
it makes perfect sense  thanks for taking the time to explain  i also see your conundrum  in order to print a warning  you would effectively have to respond to the idea that the gem is being run in a rails project  which creates an explicit coupling to rails  i suppose you could print such a warning whenever a command is forwarded to neo4j rake_tasks   but i suppose the most reasonable way to deal with this would be to just put a line somewhere in the docs 
yes  thanks for your swift response as always

this was the reason why the shortname was added  thank you  would be nice if there at the bridge settings would be an option to allow message from the webpage to be sent without shortname  maybe it would help to change the text from  prefix message subjects with the   to  always prefix message subjects with the      
in our list  the default setup is to send all messages to moderation there is no exception just to make sure the messages are not sent accidentally  so  if i am sending a message to the group  i have to wait for other moderators to approve  but we don't need that situation  i can review  similar to preview  my message and approve it if everything looks good 
 davglass hmm  when running on my local server using my own comboloader  even though it receives the correct response  200   it still downloads the css 3 times  when i inspect the requests in firebug  i can confirm that indeed  the response is sent correctly and a status code of 200 was used 
thanks for you quick response  you inspired me  here is my old code  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel get 'id'   modifyrowmodel    finally i updated to this  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel get 'id'   modifyrowmodel getattrs      now it works like a charm  but if we can use like this  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel    that would be wonderful 
i will do pull request in the future  gotta become more familiar with forking yui  sorry about that  just a small change should have been made a simple pull request by myself  
probably caused by the same bug  but i can't tell  i don't mind merging this ticket into #1343 as long as it's addressed 
yes  we can't do anything about it    it is a mozilla bug  i tested the raw event for the expected zero and concluded that information was lost in event facade or on the way to it  the fact is that it is always zero  "the button and detail properties only apply to the mouse button related events  not mouse movement events  for the mousemove event  for example  both properties will be set to 0 " https   developer mozilla org en us docs xul tutorial more_event_handlers redirectlocale en us redirectslug xul_tutorial 2fmore_event_handlers the solution they suggest is to account for what buttons are pressed on  mousedown   that's not easy to do in yui  is it  at any rate  i would prefer these properties to be undefined  rather than incorrect 
yes  it affects 3 10 3  here's a simple test case  https   gist github com brunobasto 6002949#file testing yui 3 10 3 custom events wildcard would be nice if you guys were able to include that in 3 11 0  thanks for the quick answer  satyen 
i don't think this is new behaviour but i can check  i just ran into another regression so i need to go back anyway  i'm using a global io header mechanism  this mechanism is bypassed in an io form scenario when upload   true  yui add 'msa io'  function y    var origio   y io  globalheaders      '0 0 1'    requires    'io base'  'event custom'      
yeah  i'll do that  give me a little bit to set that up  what do you think about it for the other components  though 
you should scroll down to the end  when the scrollbar bounces back  the issue happen  i use ipad 2 with ios 6 1 3  here is screenshot    image  https   f cloud github com assets 414082 1104135 6834d6cc 18e5 11e3 8f2e 189f3e02cd51 jpg 
i assumed you guys were trying to get away from using flash all together  so i suggested removing references to using the flash component in the examples  so new people don't get tied up with it

ryuichi  the reason to allow for “no”t setting the env parameter is for performance reasons  when the ‘env’ parameter is set  yql will do a backend http request  so the default is to hit ‘datatables org’ for all requests  in my case  none of my tables are part of datatables org  i don’t need that backend request  brock davis 404 345 3440 yid  brocktriplets from  ryuichi okumura  mailto notifications github com  sent  tuesday  december 31  2013 2 56 am to  yui yui3 cc  brock davis subject  re   yui3  yql request defaults env parameter to open tables  no easy way to turn off   #1509  ah  i understand now  yql module set env parameter to the community tables at datatables org as default indeed  i think it's basically works fine  why do you want to turn off the env parameter  — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com yui yui3 issues 1509#issuecomment 31386945 
i should probably explain more what i was am trying to do    i have a repo of yui3 modules which i want to be able to build and test on it's own  without the need to link to our  non yui  combo service  i can run the tests via  grover  if i install copy of yui3 in this repo  so rather than ask each dev to checkout yui3 i wanted it to be automatic on  npm install  of the repo dev packages  so i tried via npm  as you said  i can simply  npm install yui   but this seems to give a slightly different tree to what's in yui yui3 build  and installing via the github url gives the above error  installing via bower makes more sense  to me anyway  in that i want yui3 the front end lib not yui3 the nodejs lib  it also seems to install quicker  and most importantly it works   
hello  unfortunately  this is still an issue for me  i can show it a web conference if needed  please let me know  thanks  sridhar
 okuryu  thank you for the response  i'll file an issue on the correct repository 
yep  that would solve this particular issue 
hey  thanks for the answer  i tried sleep already  but didn't work  the funny thing is  that the same tests actually work on my colleagues machines  and indexing works perfectly in development environment in my app  any ideas what could be wrong too  
the "rescue" does not work within my application  too  here is a simplified snippet of code   despite the "rescue" the exception is raised  btw  the option "ignore_errors" is working fine  but i want to catch errors by myself  my environment    ruby 1 8 7  2010 12 23 patchlevel 330   i686 darwin10    rails 2 3 10   sphinx 0 9 9 release  r2117    thinkingsphinx 1 4 1
ok  so it is defiantly that line  i tried that code out and had the same problem  i then changed the code to  where "active   true and expiration   # time now to_formatted_s  db  "  and got a new error 
i'm getting     i think the  match '  '   is the culprit   but not sure how to remove it 
not really   and now its consistent   the first request it errors out  and after that its fine 
its rake ts index
btw  this line also gives an error of column does not exist   the first column name is not surrounded by double quotes 
thnks pat  and i am sorry that i wasted your time  this is the old logic that i used before sphinx and has nothing to do with the sphinx  there is search method that's conflicting with it  sorry

heh  you're fast  i found the issue  and it's my application's fault  not ts's  i'm not completely familiar with this codebase  but the model in question had a  set_property  min_infix_len    3  attribute set 
thank you   that fixed it  is there any way to reference a field conditionally based on class  edit  i e  some of the fields in the "polymorphically" associated classes are different 
hi pat  i had run ts rebuild  but doing it again produces an error  error  index 'site_core'  sql_range_query  error  function array_agg   does not exist line 1     al_class"  0 as "sphinx_deleted"  array_to_string array_agg       hint  no function matches the given name and argument types  you might need to add explicit type casts   dsn pgsql   postgres     localhost 5432 ppe_development   which is a bit odd because it's a perfectly valid postgres function  could this be to do with the fact that it's interfacing to searchd as mysql 
 pat thanks for replying yes i do have cron jobs scheduled using whenever gem  but none of them are relevant to thinking_sphinx except  i assume  searchd  is fine here
i have this errors approxinmatelly one per day  but i use sphinx only in admin panel  not in users interface  i will install monit and send you logs after i get results 
 +1  cool response   and i can confirm that this is resolved  
i actually rewrote  to_param    even if i commented out the  to_param  method  it's still the same  i'm sorry to have gotten so many errors  thanks

 pat i use    rails 4   thinking sphinx v3 1 4 and in model i define like this 
 pat we're at latest setup  i think   sphinx 2 2 11  and  ts   3 3 0   the thing that it has worked until recently  we're trying to backtrack everything step by step but with no success yet  do you think it's remotely possible that timezone and locale could interfere with this 
i've tried to isolate the problem to be able to reproduce it  but no luck so far  the project runs rails 3 2 22 2  it works fine on ruby 2 1 and 2 2  but not on ruby 2 3  in the glance_search gem it just works  tried with rails 3 2 22 2 and rails 4 2   i'll investigate further 
first  thank you all contributors and you pat for this project    it's cool gem  and second  thank you for fast answer and fix this issue  all work fine  ps  side effect   mmm    i monkeypatch ar batches#find_in_batches default batch_size 1000    50  and several script in my project changed not good  it's was day not good solutions  we will not remember it    for future may be made "batch_size" option of "thinkingsphinx  index define"  example   popular news site  we have article model  small count  huge content   need small batch_size we have comment model  huge count  small content   need big batch_size
thanks for quick answer  pat it would be great to add mention about automatic invoking and maybe even example how to do it with every deploy  or maybe only when thinking_sphinx config changes if that is even possible  yes  i'm using shared paths  here is my ts config 
sometimes once every few days  sometimes more  i didn't notice any exact periodicity  sphinx  3 0 3 mysql  i don't have access to the server now  so i don't know the mysql version  thinking sphinx  4 0 i got a call from a customer describing a problem  a few hours later he said that the site was already working  this means that the connection was first lost  and then appeared  i looked at the cron and saw there the periodic re indexation  it is possible that reindexing somehow restarted sphinx  or thinking sphinx 
edge rails from two days ago  some commit yesterday broke view rendering for me  
we're using formtastic 9 8 with rails 2 3 8  we're not using the rails_xss plugin 
http   pastie org 1044987
it works with the wrapper 
in this example i have project has_many tasks and a lot of unassigned tasks  i'd like to enter id's of tasks  that may be found for example with autocomplete  and submit to application  currently it's submitting as string  is there any way to submit as array 
it is erroring on line 424 which is not rescued  try testing it again with a single attribute and pass an object to semantic_form_for  pre   code  class foo attr_accessor  attr end   code    pre  this works   pre   code     semantic_form_for  foo   url    ' ' do  f         f inputs  attr       end      code    pre  this errors   pre   code     semantic_form_for foo new   url    ' ' do  f         f inputs  attr       end      code    pre  which is expected since the symbol fails the conditional check on line formtastic rb 423 and is rescued on line formtastic rb 426  but when passed an object it passes the conditional check and gets the undefined method error since it is not rescued on line formtastic rb 424  hope that helps 
i created this example  schema rb create_table "posts"   force    true do  t  t string "title" t text "body"     end app controllers posts_controller rb def index  search   post search params  search    posts    search all end app views posts index html erb    semantic_form_for  search do  f         f input  title_eq        f buttons       end    when i try to go to http   localhost 3000 posts i get this error  undefined method  new_record ' for #class 0xb5f6a094
never written any     i'll definitely add asap  can you point me to a good primer 
that is probably the cause  i was working with another package that wanted url things capitalized so i set the inflector  i am going to mark this closed as it's probably to much of an edge case to bother worrying about 
add_column  members   interests   string created field shows  displayed as text          ""   "workshops"   ""   ""   landscape   ""   ""   "" when above formtastic line is in the edit view file  none of the checkboxes are checked 
your first guess was right   i had just changed the default language and let an empty i18n file  silly me   sorry for the noise  and keep up the good work 
it is true  i was calling "form semantic_fields_for  user company do  company "  when it should have been "form semantic_fields_for  company do  company "  sorry  this issue can be closed 
i am using ubuntu 10 04 and firefox 3 6 6   didnt try other browsers os' so far  think that makes a difference 
i'm not sure why it's happening on my system  but i can stop it happening by adding " lib    false" to the config gem line  is it normal practice for rails init rb to require the library  isn't that usually handled by the rails gem loading code  which makes line 2 of that file redundant  also  by the time that init rb file is loaded  is it reasonable to assume the formtastic lib  dir is on the load path  that would mean the line could be changed to just "require 'formtastic'" which would avoid the file being loaded a second time 
thank you  it worked   i had  symbol in my form  can you try in the code to instantiate a  object from a  symbol and thus overcome this issue  
rails 3 0 0  ruby 1 9 2  formtastic rails3  0 9 10 0   hmmm seems to be an old formtastic version  i think i will go to 1 1 0 and try again 
yes  this work with 1 2 1beta  btw it is rails 1 9 2  rails 3  thanks 
i'm currently outputting checkboxes in a grid format for a setting hours open for a restaurant  the x axis is for days and the y axis is for time in increments of 15 minutes  so the checkbox is for an attribute named is_open  checking a box for a particular day and time means that restaurant is open for that time slot  with the field type being a boolean and the two x y describing the checkbox there is really no need for a label  of this is a has_many relationship and these are nested attributes  can't really see this applying any other way 
i think you could do it in two steps    # do the dumb approach  as you suggested     which gives allows us the ability to do things easily  # later do the "smart" thing  which amounts to a working "stack" or perhaps a simple rule  like  if in a form input  then wrap in li    true   makes it easier to move to the eventual solution  but certainly  it was a "surprise" when it didn't work 
heh  my fault  will edit it right now to work fine  thought  errors  work the same as  errors full_messages   but it's not  the difference  for example  some locales could have errors format set to    message    and in current version it will print out  name name is blank    so it's not correct  or you want to have    attribute     name    right now it's impossible without monkey patching the  semanticformbuilder  or creating own builder  may be i'm wrong    but right now i miss some features like  https   rails lighthouseapp com projects 8994 tickets 3768 patch add full_message option to validations but those features it totally related to active_model

excellent question   turns out i was using 1 2  not realising 2 x was required for rails 3 1  facepalms   everything now working with 2 0 0 rc2  thanks for your assistance 
yes it's about 2 0 0 rc2 and rails 3  sorry for mistake 
sorry i forgot to specify  rails 3 1 0rc4 ruby 1 9 2  linux  formtastic 2 0 0rc3
yep 
i did fresh new vanilla rails test app with formtastic gem 2 0 0 rc1 and ran the formtastic install generator
"studies show that those side by side inputs  as opposed to a nice uniform series of labels and widgets  actually perform way worse in user testing " you are operating on outdated info there  or you aren't thinking of specific cases where it makes sense  like with an expiration date  credit card numbers and security codes  for too general of an accusation to make  either way it seems like  wrapper_html    false is a logical feature but we basically went with your #2 response before reading this  thanks for the response 
it's common to give the listed element unique ids for javascript manipulation  formtastic uses fieldsets inside a wrapper li input for nested records   something like that anyway  thanks for your response  ryan
ok  and how can i put html in the  hint attribute 
im new in rails  so i didnt patched anything   s im using gem 'formtastic' gem 'formtastic bootstrap' is it what u meant  
simple  i wanted to access form element  i wanted to append some html to it  so needed handle to it  though i had single form on the page  wanted to have a clear way to select it  so found  namespace would assign id _ namespace  to it  but not found working  i ended up using   "form formtastic"

what perms are needed  i actually created a new new app with 3 20 mojo and it works fine  i am using  debian squeeze 6 0 4 perl 5 14 2   perlbrew  original app generate by mojolicious 2 98 i think it may be a fact that the app was generated by old version  on sun  aug 5  2012 at 2 06 pm  marcus ramberg   reply reply github com
then it is more a unix fork design problem rather than a perl problem  imho  rand   is crucial and i suppose many modules use it internally  there is no safe way of keeping developers from stepping into this pitfall 
i think that to avoid security and other risks you should give for endpoint mojo user the feature to configure hidden method like    app  routes  your_has_name_allow_action qr   x ac00   x d7af       then the  line 53  https   github com kraih mojo blob aea16c61fd730a14053539332707ff3f770e7277 lib mojolicious routes pm#l53  would be like   return     h    method     index  method  '_'     0       method      a z         endpointuser_allow_qr     method      endpointuser_allow_qr        
well  mojo could try rename   itself and if it fails use a non blocking copy via it's ioloop
sorry for the misleading wording  it's the helper 'dumper' coming with mojolicious  plugin  defaulthelpers 
 jhthorsen we have 9000+ routes in our app  i have created a small example app with   mojo generate app and added this to myapp pm  here is the resulting flame graph     http   i imgur com ujsktbm png  we make 100 request for each of the 100 last routes  so we have 1  cache miss and 99  hits but the run time is dominated by mojolicious  routes  lookup which is used in the miss case 
yes  it was chromium queueing requsts to the same url  the case is closed  everything works as expected here 
well  now i'm not sure if i'm reading the spec right  rfc 3986  3 3 paths  says which is backwards from what i initially read it as  i was assuming this was to account for things like the protocol relative css usage  but it's the other way around  so apparently the url  is  valid  which means mojo definitely shouldn't be returning the first bite of path as the hostname  and dropping the real hostname   so i amend my initial expectation  the path should be returned as "  fred fish" since that's allowable   hmm  https   stackoverflow com a 20524044 reads the rfc backwards too  so it's not just me   it comes out of the regex okay so i'm wondering if the double slashes are triggering another call to mojo  url  but i haven't poked deeply into that 
i mean  doesn't it depend what you mean by "normalized"  that's a bit of a subjective term  normalized in terms of what  what's normal here  if you think this is the right way for things to be  i guess that's fine  but it's a change from how things worked before  and it is not clear from the overall context of this commit that it was actually intended  the whole sequence of commits is a bit tricky to understand  since it seems to involve removing this "verbose mode" then putting it back again  so i figured i'd just file an issue so you can check whether it's intentional and desired or not 
when your app does something memory intensive but not very often  so you lower  accepts  value to release memory back to the os  afaik this  or memory leakage  is the primary use case for similar setting in other web servers  e  g   httpd's maxconnectionsperchild  https   httpd apache org docs current mod mpm_common html#maxconnectionsperchild   in my case setting  accepts  to 10 resulted in several dozens core dumps a day on a modest 2 rps 
my plan was to factor out the important bit of  json_has  and reuse that to decide whether to spit out an alternative message 
imho  warnings in this use case has no sense  i know it is easy to avoid them  but if the meaning of this function is cleaning blanks  the warnings are useless  i could understand better if there are only one warning message from the caller perspective  not the internals of this sub 
i looked further into this issue and it has nothing to do with factory girl  ruby 1 9 chokes on non ascii characters by definition  i overcome this by putting  # encoding  utf 8 as the first line of every file that had non ascii characters 
 file exists   will return true but the file cannot be loaded using that same path  on windows  
yes  joe    i'm sorry  i looked for a way to delete but couldnt find one 
i don't think so but i really don't know much about the pickle or factorygirl code  i just found that some cucumber features stopped working for me and i narrowed it down to the latest factory_girl  the deprecation warning also was a tip off   we might need to consult with some of the core maintainers of pickle to be sure of what is best  it might be helpful to still have a #factories method on the registry that did not return the sequences but ultimately you have a better idea of what your api should offer

strange  i just grepped the factorygirl source and found no securerandom  i also removed the deprecation silencers from my project and am no longer seeing the warnings i remember seeing when i opened this issue  i guess this issue is closed 
adding  rake  to gemfile with  require  false  doesn't solve the problem  as you can see rails is doing it internaly  https   github com rails rails blob 3 0 stable railties lib rails application rb#l213 so there is no easy way for workaround  i'm pretty sure that this will break lot of applications tests  because there are bunch of methods that can be often used as attributes in activerecord models  i e   task    rule   etc  method_missing is evil    
hmm    looks like going from factory_girl_rails 1 0 1 to 1 1 0 seems to have fixed the issue  i'm going to close the issue 
i have factory_girl  2 0 4  and factory_girl_rails  1 1 0   and they were up to date before the rails upgrade 
yes  i can create a new obj with customer new  the problem disappeared after the dependency on factory_girl_rails  by factory_girl  was dropped and factory   was replaced with factory build    somehow factory_girl developed dependency on factory_girl_rails in my system  still don't know why   with factory_girl installed  gem check required factory_girl_rails to be installed  however when both factory_girl and factory_girl_rails installed  they generated conflict with duplicate error  after hours of failed tries  the conflict dependency mysteriously disappeared after rebooting and reloading the system  thanks 
i'm aware of overrides and traits  but alas they don't seem to solve the problem i'm trying to address  specifically  i don't want to load up n factories when only a tiny handful of these will ever be used in a given test  the fact that my tests must load a number of factory files before i can do anything is a little disappointing  i like it when my tests are isolated and are as explicit as possible about their structural dependencies  having this would be a bonus because i'd get all the usefulness that factorygirl provides and yet still be assured that i wouldn't load anything beyond what was minimally necessary for the test to run  the answer may just be "well  that's not how factorygirl works right now  sorry"  and that's fine too  i can still use it with workarounds  but before i give up  i thought i'd ask around a bit 
no  you're right   i had been seeing this behavior and thinking that ar assigned an id which wasn't happening with fg  they do both work the same  closing this as a non issue 
wow  i actually tested    forgery  internet   before  which didn't work   but    forgery  internet  worked now  thanks   
that's what i ended up going with  i was just trying to figure out if there was special syntax that handled those types of scenarios that i had misinterpreted missed  thanks 
thanks  i just used "bundle update"  what should i use instead of "factory"  i am so confused by docs for fg4 and old ones    
in a large project context setup is the most complicated part and it is always flipped no matter how you define it  in general  i feel like this feature gives additional flexibility to generate data with factorygirl  which is its main goal  i don't want factorygirl to decide how should i generate my context  it's my job  just want a flexible tool to do it  ### live examples  https   gist github com 5795005 https   gist github com 5795040 ### simplified version of live examples  that is too complex to show real code i am doing things from your code example about 3 times a day  in a team of 5 people it is 15 times a day average  let's take the following association chain 
 djcp i tried that  the error persists 
thanks
my goal in the above example is not to use the  foo  factory  just a bad example  i'll update the attribute name accordingly so it's less confusing
 promoderates good point  i'll change all  doe  references in the code to a similar string  would be great if we can look at getting this merged once i've done that 
 joshuaclayton only one factory file in the project  this is the full output in the terminal  is that the backtrace  sorry noob here  
yes  you can  i've now created a fork at http   github com jlh prawn and pushed what i hope is a real fix for a real bug 
same code  just put some static code for bug reporting purpose  text is actually coming from database  i can update the script to include the same text if you want

thanks for the comment  looking forward to the change 
yeah  i think you're right that this is caused by #268  it seems like the issue i'm having with the color swapping only happens on page boundaries 
at  574 152   i e  just where it has been before the bounding_box   canvas 
maybe 'custom styles' isn't the right word  but in the pdfs we build  we use a mix of font weights  light  normal  and bold  
i keep getting this error message   so i have tried changing the font to a ttf font as adviced  did it  as i described in my initial message  but i still get the same error  i simply don't know where the problem is and how to solve it   
 pointlessone i have pushed a repo to replicate the error 
yes it works wmname   "qtile"   didn't work wmname   "lg3d"   works well also works if remove wmname package from system
doesn't replays
thanks  i'm researching an alternative approach using screenlets  i'll let you know if i still need this issue resolved once i have clarified my requirement 
i did some testing  and the sleep line did seem to make for a great work around  but just as i was writing this comment  the issue reoccurred  here's a screenshot    screenie  https   raw github com gist 3775670 b7b2bbd27ffbc5c87838b02b7b708f94b45f7206 textbox 20redraw 20error png 
ho    weird  
tried with the latest version  still happening with kde4 and kde3 tde   window is messed up after restarting qtile  not redrawn and all the tray icons become windows 
i'm using 0 10 4 seems to be fixed in develop
this worked thanks

hello  i replaced the whole widget folder with the one from your repo branch and it works again  thanks on 26 09 2014 18 57  tycho andersen wrote 
i change the title  actually now it doesn't work with html5 videos  it stay on the browser window but dont go fullscreen  browser  chromium and firefox
on my system two of the  so filenames are slightly different so i'm using  libpango and libpangocairo should have been installed through apt  i used  dpkg  l libpango 1 0 0 amd64  and  dpkg  l libpangocairo 1 0 0 amd64  to locate these files  i'm not sure if this counts as a bug or if there is a more system independent way to write this  but it's a step beyond the documented installation instructions i had to take

this won't be enough because the battery is not necessarily empty when it is in the "unknown" state  the batteries are not discharged one after the other  first one battery goes 5  then the other one is discharged 
good point   i have attached my log file   qtile log  https   github com qtile qtile files 1686571 qtile log 
 display  0 xrandr  with the abovementioned situation outputs   it appears the error i mentioned does nor occur in conjunction with the situation in question 
i can  and that is what i do for almost everything  but that requires a patched font instead of obeying  fontconfig  rules for some reason  i've still to find a patched font that doesn't  in one way or another  butcher the original  what i resort to now is a  textbox  widget for each icon  with a custom font that contains _only_ icons  and a standard font for the widget itself  the trouble is  i can't set icons for dynamic widgets this way  such as the battery charging indicator 
firefox 63 0 1  i did not try any other version  just this one  i'll play around more with this today and see if i can come up with any more information about the problem

we don't have emojis  unfortunately this will be a hard one to track down in the console  it seems related to rails autoloading and is sporadic  so probably depends on the order in which things run on a new process  will try to pin it down if we see another case
the performance downgrade i'm seeing in my benchmarks with that change is   it's the big emails  attachments  where this change is slowing things for 100   also  my test suite time with this "improvement" is 1 62 sec and without it 1 48 sec     you can check out locally by disabling that change

 jeremy is it related to this  https   github com mikel mail issues 1038
sure   i haven't encountered this in production  but i was working on a refactor of a notification system that would have been able to do some fancy tricks by passing  mail  message s around and then calling  deliver  in a centralized location  but given the common usage pattern in rails of invoking  deliver  directly on the mailer  it would have created this risk  so   abbreviated 
hi  ahorek  thank you for your response  some software is known to modify convert messages in a subtle way  e g by converting the transfer encoding to 7bit  quoted printable  or base64  or removing trailing spaces   it doesn't matter for many users because the meaning of the message is preserved  the message will be delivered  and will be readable  that said  when you're going to sign your message with open pgp  and probably some other tools as well   you got another problem  such alterations typically invalidate the signature  for this reason  both rfc 1847 "security multiparts"  and rfc 3156 "mime security with openpgp"  make restrictions on transfer encoding  they require that the signed message part is encoded either as quoted printable or base64  and has no trailing spaces  and this is the only reason why i want to force the transfer encoding of my choice  the problem is explained in detail in rfc 3156 section 3 "content transfer encoding restrictions"  and somewhat in rfc 1847 section 2 1 "definition of multipart signed"    https   tools ietf org html rfc1847   https   tools ietf org html rfc3156
ah yes  sorry i missed these since they were closed  i'll test the 2 7 1 rc1 gem  but looking at the patches from #1168 i am pretty sure it will solve my problem  thanks 
sure  attached is a sample pdf with an image and code to reproduce the error   yo pdf  https   github com mikel mail files 2647022 yo pdf  mail   mail new mail attachments "yo pdf"    file read "yo pdf"  file open "yo out pdf"  "wb"    f  f write mail attachments first decoded  system "open yo out pdf"
hi   jeremy  thanks for the quick response  i just tried both 2 7 1 and 2 8 0 edge and the problem is still reproducible on both  if my reading of https   github com mikel mail pull 1062 is correct  it only added support for the utf 7 binary encoding and not the utf 7 quoted printable encoding 
an all_headers config setting would be sufficient for me  but the way the header_filter is implemented right now it would make sense to convert it into a setting itself 
i've tested today again  and it works  what's strange  i'm supposed that there would be a configuration issue related to serving media  although i haven't changed nothing 
not sure if you got my emails or not  i can't see them here   but anyway  this is the error message i get  template error in template  library python 2 6 site packages django_debug_toolbar 0 8 4 py2 6 egg debug_toolbar templates debug_toolbar base html  error at line 49 caught attributeerror while rendering  'template' object has no attribute 'origin' 39   div  40    for panel in panels    41    if panel has_content    42  div id "   panel dom_id   " class "panelcontent"  43  div class "djdebugpaneltitle"  44  a href "" class "djdebugclose"    trans "close"     a  45  h3    panel title safe     h3  46   div  47  div class "djdebugpanelcontent"  48  div class "scroll"  49    panel content safe    50   div  51   div  52   div  53    endif    54    endfor    55  div id "djdebugwindow" class "panelcontent"   div  56   div  57

 tim schilling thanks  i guess reading the documentation would have been a good idea  as a long time use of the beta version  i was expecting a drop in replacement  changing that setting fixed the problem  i still think this is a bug  if  debug_toolbar_patch_settings  defaults to  true   it should support core django features  like custom user models 
 aaugustin  it was caused by a  bug  https   github com etianen django reversion issues 241  in django reversion  sorry to bother you over it 
oops sorry  copy pasta'd version from django extensions  my app doesn't understand the   debug    routing on a sql explain  reinstalled from master  same issue 
i was reading the readthedocs org documentation  which claimed to be the latest version  i've since closed the tab  but i remember checking to see what version it was  and it said "v  latest" but didn't list any other available versions  when i go to the readthedocs org site now  i see that the latest docs have the new panel name  and the 0 11 0 docs have the old panel name  the webpage must have been showing the old docs but claiming they were the new ones  very strange 
it does fix the problem  thanks for the quick feedback 
if you ask so nicely    closing as superseded by my pr in #559 
i'm using chrome   chromium  latest  i'll test it out on other browsers and report my findings  thanks
sorry for the late response  i think the traceback is useless  but anyway here it is   i don't understand while it autoreloads just after starting  i didn't modify any code and it does it everytime when djdt is enabled  you can find  my custom user model here  https   github com 1flow 1flow blob feature django 1 6 oneflow base models py   and  the contents of my virtualenv here  https   gist github com karmak23 11305946

my models py  omitted a few lines    before that it was zenusers just after the debug_toolbar entry in installed_apps
no  this is not a error  just warnning but it cause http 500  the last few lines like 
 xavierdutreilh you're right  my mistake  sorry
note that debug toolbar middleware recommends going first  but it works better if it's after whitenoise which should be first  ala   serving media files isn't slow  what was slow was all the profiling and stuff being run on all the static content requests  note from whitenoise project  i run my development using gunicorn and most of the static requests tend to be 304 responses  machine was getting bogged down trying to profile requests that weren't needed  it's actually usable now  not running ddt on prod

development web server not start up 
yes  i have it set in there  the toolbar displays fine and the rest of the panels work  so this problem seems to be cache specific  this is the rest of my config  debug_toolbar_patch_settings   false debug_toolbar_config     'show_collapsed'  true    internal_ips    '127 0 0 1'  '  1'  '10 0 0 49'  on mon  jun 1  2015 at 2 34 pm  tim schilling notifications github com wrote 
i would have if i was a bit more fluent with python packaging  very limited experience here sorry      as i mentionned  i don't even know if it's actually technically possible to do something like this  but anyway   the best fix amha would be to plain remove the requirement on django 1 7 and clearly document which django version is supported  i know the information is there   i found it browsing the tags on github and finally installed 1 3 2   but it's not obvious on readthedoc   that's what most django apps do fwiw  debug_toolbar is the first one i've met that tried to update my django install  my 2 cents   
which code did you use 
there is no error anywhere  as i said it all worked perfectly in django 1 10 4  it is even broken in my samsung tablet  the 'hide   ' tab does work  but none of the others function at all  this is my dev env settings

usually i spend a long time to ensure that every application's look'n'feel is as similar to others as possible  regardless of the used toolkit  so yes  for me the ui font setting is totally unnecessary  although it might be useful to retain the fontdiff setting   other users may of course feel differently     fontdiff  i remember reading about one person who had a similar problem with exactly the same fonts  but with a gtk based application  unfortunately i couldn't find the link now   so the actual problem may be deeper   
i do not have a     colarc  i have a     cola   i also don't have a     config git cola  
thanks  i think you can add a function  but i may don't use it  too  i now understand  
i don't think it's a dupe of #174   git cola  keeps the preferences for the session  i'm on ubuntu 12 10  running  git cola  1 4 3 5  i know it used to work  but it's never worked on this particular machine 
looks like it isn't and i was wrong  i'll have to check next time whether it's slow with a normal commit  in my mind  committing and amending are the same thing  so my memory about this is unreliable 
i am on 1 9 4  i will upgrade and re open this issue if the problem persists  meanwhile  thank you for your time 
hi  davvid  on the time of opening this issue   latest commit on master was 59e686e099abe0a3ff7da7e35e9bc8ca0d1b4b39  i can confirm  that build from this commit still reproduces described issue  however current latest commit from the master 4409089292cbdf86282c54a4b7e95d2d8e48f3fb doesn't have the defect anymore  so  we can close this issue  i think  anyway  to prevent such a case for new users in future   i would still put a step with  git checkout  on latest stable and tested version

the revert fixed it  the "success" list comes from calling table   on the query table  for some reason  we decided to make table   return a string instead of being void  i don't think fitnesse does anything with the result  so changing table   to not return anything also fixes the problem  however  i'm guessing a similar problem will occur if the query method returns list with an element that has    in it  see https   github com gshakhn fitnesse commit da9bf793bc1d4b01551e6f94ecacfb14f3e23835 for a test case 
i've updated the issue layout so you can more easily read it  if  like you said  it's the same  i'm fairly certain that it's the same problem  since i also used jdk 7 
not sure why you say hundreds of rows is fishy  we switched to slim few months ago but this issue is common in both  this is a very common use case  all of our tests had to be refactored to smaller tests  had been trying to resolve this since a year now  yahoo groups never responded 
one question regarding integration tests is how to manage the versions of dependencies  would we check master branches  latest maven versions  which java version to use  e g  we may move dbfit to java 8+ some day         it can be this way to kick it off quickly if it's acceptable for fitnesse  dbfit is just one of the fitnesse clients so a general solution perhaps may evolve into something more complicated  e g  separate project or sub project

thanks for your help and sorry for the delayed response on this  it looks like the issue was just in the weird version  not sure how that happened  a more recent one fixed the problem  if it's still of any interest  the memory usage would grow to a normal size at the start of the test and then spike right at the end  after the test was finished  memory usage would not decrease  running the test multiple times did not cause the memory to spike as dramatically at the end but did increase memory usage over time  again  the newer version of fitnesse fixed the issue so it's probably not an issue any more 
this happens in every single search i run  title or content based  whenever the search is complete  that seems to be the pattern   this does not occur when doing a properties based search  which i thought was kind of peculiar

jediwhale  thanks for your great idea  really  i started to localize test page which produced stackoverflow exception and i found it  the issue is that i have placed a reference for page1 on exactly this page1  e g  there is following page with path suite1 suite2 suite3 and in content txt file of this page there is following text   include  suite1 suite2 suite3
it's bombing at this point     any ideas from that 
i managed to get it working by changing the method name to   public boolean checkifsorted list  string   values    so  this is definitely looks like a method naming issue  i would like to know the rules and why   issorted   cannot be found by slim system 
 six42 for example  if im testing a list of apis using the restfixture  i'd like to pass a root urls using a properties file so that they're all in one place  i could define them all in the root but i'd prefer them outside of fitnesse files  currently  i've added them into  plugins properties  but was just wondering if there's a way to pass multiple properties files to fitnesse so that fitnesse plugins config and my properties are separated out 
yes  you are right  keetron   adding   define slim port  0   solves the issue 
 jeremycarlsten i put my jar as you said and i still have an error 
to ensure highly available sut and abstract the web server from running the test  it's not a big issue but is nice to have    i'm can think of some workaround to do it but i want to know first if fitnesse slim support it out of the box 
we are using our fixtures  included on classpath   so i suppose it will be translated to symbols  right now i increased heap to 8gb and looking what is happening there  for you request   i will try

okay  so i went to recreate the problem and in an effort to remove as many variables as possible i tried things from the command line instead of from rubymine  which is my normal environment   the segmentation fault only happened when running it in rubymine  from the command line it became a normal  if surprising  lexing error  as it turns out  i had rubymine using 1 9 2 and my system default was 1 9 3  switching to 1 9 2 on my system yielded the expected segfault  i have not investigated 1 8 7 or 2 0 at this time  in both cases i am using gherkin 2 11 6 on a 64 bit windows 7 os  i did a search for that mkmf log file but the only one that turned up on my whole machine was for the ruby debug base19 gem  here is a gist of the files that i am using to cause the problem  https   gist github com enkessler 5233587
sure  i will send one later today 
sorry after hard time to dealing i found the core of this issue  i assumed that the two presence in the before hook means that the one should belong to the background part  conclusion was  that my support env rb has been loaded two times  therefore every hook has been executed twice  this should have been part of flow control in before after hooks  now it's clear  that background doesn't have before hook  however  regarding scenariooutline examplerow   i found in the web  that order of scenario types which should appear in before after hook should be following   before    1st scenariooutline   per every step   examplerow  after    x times   examplerow   1x scenariooutline am i correct 
i'll work on this asap
we're just using the default json formatter with a guard against people who monkeypatch time now with timecop  https   github com circleci cucumber formatter it looks like it would  but we would need a way to hook into it from outside of the test suite  similar to what we're doing with custom formatters 
i tried with 2 0 0 beta 3 and the result is still the same 
e g  a step like    i delete the      w+     project    and then this call will not be matched   step needs to be modified to this for such use case to work     i delete the    "  w+  "   project    but now i read https   github com cucumber cucumber wiki step argument transforms it looks like the transform step is matching individual matches instead of whole step string  i guess that this feature just can't work this way  maybe another transform hook is needed if whole step string is to be transformed 
 cucumber   version  gives 1 3 17  backed up by gemfile lock 
checked on "v1 3 19" and "v1 3 17"
i can parse the output to detect my specific problem  but it isn't generic solution  here is more info about exit statuses  http   www gnu org software libc manual html_node exit status html cucumber is very specific application  which should fail even if it actually works  so i don't know if it is possible to follow any standard convention  however status 0 is always success and every other is an error  so the simplest thing is to define at least 3 exit statuses  0   success  1   cucumber error  2   failing specs  but there might be some conventions i don't know  i'm curious what other people think about it 
 tooky thanks steve  good to know that  but i think it will be worth to clean up our step definitions  unfortunately not in the near future which was the reason for this issue 
hey   mattwynne  thanks for your reply as in the example above  we just want to have the printed message from a step can go with the step name printed by cucumber pretty formatter  otherwise  as you see above  the message printed from step1 " in step 1" is above the scenario line    kind of messy    any suggestions  thanks
thanks for getting back to me  here goes the gemfile   i am using refinerycms and am trying to upgrade to version 3  had no issues before the upgrade   but the upgrade has affected quite a few gems  i am getting no stack trace for deprecation warnings  please let me know how i can switch it on for cucumber 
 danascheider i'm on a really tight schedule right now  and would not be able to participate  thank you for offer  i understand  that it's possible to do that already  but have not checked 
 luke hill sorry i don't have a simple repro for this as i found it only when profiling some code on my side where i had extended from the existing json formatter and noticed that this method getting called a lot and spending time when there was no ned to calculate the length of the step like the pretty formatter requires  when i dug a bit more into it i noticed the typo and overrode on my side to increase quite a bit the performance of the json formatter 
 aslakhellesoy need your assistance please

hi  odbc was installed using http   www odbcmanager net  i have it all working fine on 3 0 7 but as soon as i try to install with 3 0 10 i get the compiler issues 
that is correct  and it will be a single commit patch 
how would you suggest me to do that without having a database  it's not just as easy as posting the python code    thank you
sorry  the dockerfiles were missing gcc  so here's the corrected ones 
yes  i installed microsoft odbc driver 13 and it worked  thank you for your response

here is an odbc trace of the above test case   odbc log  https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc files 2242321 odbc log 
i did try that and i know what kind of problems does it solve however in these cases it didn't help it's strange because the exact same query works perfectly with database administration software but with pyodbc it only works after i start removing parts of the query  i kept on experimenting for hours and i couldn't reach any reasonable conclusion on what exactly is causing these errors other than the query being "complex"

i was on 4 0 24 when i first got the issue and updated to 4 0 25
will do  working on a good example now   it seems my trivial one doesn't reproduce so there may be additional complexities here that i'm trying to track down  not sure if i'll be able to get an odbc trace for you since i'm not an admin but i'll speak w  our dbas and see what i can do  on tue  feb 26  2019 at 9 49 am v chojas  notifications github com  wrote

adding "encrypt no" to the connection string still returns the same error  openssl version is openssl 1 0 2k fips on the red hat machine  i will work on setting up wireshark to analyze both cases  thank you both

yes  most everything needed to reproduce the issue is in the project linked above  github com bpaterni simple blocking eventlet by default  app py will use the pyodbc only mssql implementation to produce 15 parallel long running queries  the hang should occur after the 15th output of "pre busy mssql" on mon  feb 3  2020  09 10 v makouz  notifications github com  wrote  
i've followed the steps in this link _https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc wiki troubleshooting  e2 80 93 generating an odbc trace log_ and tried to generate trace  but isn't working  any suggestions 
yes   i'm also using the latest odbc driver 17 for sql server  but previously was using the 13 instead and both show the same issue  
 norman that make sense  my workaround is the same  i won't be able to tackle this anytime soon but agree with you on supporting any character type field as primary key   thumbsup 
i'm using 2 3 4  norman  i just checked that while in a console i could create my model as expected with a correct slug  although in the mentioned scenario  i was creating model entries from a rake task  as soon as i get back  i'll check if it has anything to do with the text encoding in rake tasks 
thanks for the quick response  i was finally able to reproduce the problem on a fresh app  it's related to devise  if you have both 'devise_for  user'  in the routes file  and ' user     history'  in the model  in the same app the error occurs  removing either of those gets rid of the problem  here's an app you can clone to reproduce the issue  https   github com sohara historytest you'll need to have an account with heroku and use the following command to make sure you create your instance using the cedar stack  heroku create   stack cedar let me know if there's anything i can do to help  i'm no whiz but i'm happy to keep looking 
yup  sure does 
my bad   workin now
yes  it's    slugs be unique only on a per user   how  please  me help  
yes  i want to be able to set the slug updating any single postcategory record 
in fact i don't have it  i won't be able to test if that fixes this until next tuesday  as soon as i can spend some minutes on it i'll tell you  but looking in the model table should create problems if there's more than one locale active  right  we have been using refinery a lot lately  and in some multilocale sites   that's why we get quite surprised but this bug  s however  we've been thinking and we never had more than one page or blog post in more than one locale with the same title  i'll look into it and try to post an spec test to chek if it fails  maybe it's just under very uncommon circunstances that the bug arises  thanks 
nothing unreachable   just wanted to skip checking of existing object to avoid raising exceptions  and just get  nil  
thanks for your swift reply  i am using the globalize branch  git remote  git   github com norman friendly_id git revision  b80dbf1b9c2253bb043943756d13479a0c688b90 branch  globalize specs  friendly_id  5 0 0 beta3  activerecord     4 0 0 
i'm not arguing in favor of changing the behavior of  find   but maybe of overriding  find_by_id    try  sounds like a good workaround  so i'll do that 
this was fixed by https   github com norman friendly_id pull 720
 parndt thank you  i found the error  it was in our fixtures  we had a     saved as the slug  thank you for letting me know   2f        that was the key 
 parndt yes  thank you   it totally does work  but it breaks the finding of pages because ruby thinks   html  is a method  not just part of the string 
thank you for your reply  i delete the  emacs desktop ant it works well again      the version is emacs 24 4  maybe i should try another version

i update your repo and merge to my repo and update melpa  it works well now 
sorry  i found the reason is the lein  if my project have no dir named  checkout   the lein will search the maven repo for the source  so i create the  checkout  dir and  ln  the dependence source to it  this is solved  
i am not very clear about all my environment   my emacs is install by homebrew like  it seems faster a little   but it useless when editing large files  hope these info is useful  thanks

1  start emacs 2   c x c f  to open  for sh  3  type  #  usr bin en   then type  tab   but the problem is not just in one place  it appears in the following cases    shell scripts variables    python with anaconda    ruby        
i don't make any change to the configuration  i just turn up the emacs and c x c f a new file  with m x makefile mode  it's good when i just edit the file with tab  but when i save it with c x c s  the tab just become to 8 whitespces 
yeah  it works with your updated repo  thank you for taking time to fix this minor issue  would you briefly explain  for someone who knows little about emacs  how you solve the issue  besides  you suggested  in https   github com purcell exec path from shell #setting up your shell startup files correctly  that "config files should therefore set the environment variables to their exact desired final values"  but  that can be out of some users' control  in my bash_profile  for example  there is "export path " users zhfu anaconda2 bin  path"  which is automated added by anaconda2 installer  apparently 
not quite  there are plenty of valid reasons to invoke a shell command  such as vagrant does  providing a convenient wrapper around virtualbox and other vm's  however  many uses of shelling out are entirely superfluous  such as using awk from ruby  or perl 
if you believe it's a bug  then i can try attacking it from that angle  i just wanted to make sure i wasn't doing something dumb 
yeah  sure  i traced down the piece of code that raise this error 
you did a great job  anyway  thanks  keep it up  i have more feedback  maybe i should contribute a little here as i can know 
it does look like the bundle locked on an old version  closing 
yes  it can work as a solution in this case  but should this kind of code raise  instance variable assumption  smell if it's clearly not what it is  but actually opposite  i'm not assuming that this instance variable exists  i'm checking if it is 
still happens with the current master  i will try to reduce it to a simple test case and update the issue

 chneukirchen we're running a template rails app running on the torquebox stack  i don't think torquebox uses one of the included handlers  my understanding is that the handler is supposed to translate rack's headers hash into a string of newline separated key value pairs to send as response headers  obviously  this ticket can't be fixed with rack's hash data structure given that a hash cannot have duplicate keys  however  maybe i am misunderstanding the contract that rack makes with its handlers  are you saying that the handler  not rack  is responsible for translating

re examining the parser rb i now see that we scrub the filename  so this shouldn't be an issue  i was checking this on rack 1 5 2 which was different  the issue with 1 5 2 was that unescape would produce a invalid byte that was then fed into '  ' and 'split' methods which caused the invalid byte error  i guess it seems to be already resolved in master 
running the minimal version of the test suite works on master  i'll patiently await the next release  thanks    
i'm seeing th produces the error message  it's weird because i went looking at a older app i did with rack server pages and i was using just redirect   all over the app and it worked as expected   
yes i figured that out  and it's stated in the specs i pasted above  but i was particularly interested about the rack specs  i do have myself tons of custom middlewares that expect a hash and was just surprised to see that it's not defined in the specs 
 ioquatix can do  how do i know what went into 2 1 0  is it okay to move everything in “unreleased” to 2 1 0 
it also seems like it should work to me   rack  static 's constructor initializes a file server by passing the root path it receives to  rack  files   which in turn expands the path with  file expand_path  to get a full absolute path  could it be the rails web server  eg puma  applying some restrictions so that content outside of the rails app directory cannot be served 
good god no    the thing i did    total hack job was    this  i realized that if 2 0 8 works  i will use that  so i forked it  and make a branch for myself off of 2 0 8  i added in the samesite cookie and then re bundled my app to use that rack  my branch of 2 0 8  so now my app works as usual  and the chrome browser worked too with all the samesite none settings    i am going to be scared moving forward but for now it buys me a little time

hello  thank for your answer  i've switched over to em epoll and set the em set_descriptor_table_size to 60 000 now  i also changed my code from the ruby http lib to em httprequest  that also caused some crashes  now it seems to work fine  i had no crashes anymore  the interplay between rabbitmq  bunny  and the websocket server works great  my test script created 5 000 connections without crash  to select    it seems it's not validated that the descriptor size is lower then the current connection size  maybe that would help to avoid the crashes or unpredictable behaviors  best regards  alexander

it would be really convenient if the filter could take an optional language param to override  i assume   the accept language header coming from the browser  the use case being  we'd like to respect the browser on the main site  but also serve language specific subdomains  eg fr ourshop com  that always only serves the shop in french 
 fw42 honestly  it's not matter of the template or variables  even if i try example from readme   it's not working  no error thrown at all  also when using render without     errors property is not being populated 
hi  pushrax  here is the backtrace  
we had version 3 installed and now upgraded to version 4  now it runs fine  thank you very much 
it works  thanks  kainjow   
the decoding error does occur before the buffer overflow  i'm not sure how to switch between mp3 and aac the proxy software is a corporate installation  so it's not entirely clear what they installed  as i only have access to the proxy url to redirect traffic through  pianobar does not crash  it merely skips to the next song 
it's useful to access all of pandora's features strictly through the terminal for efficiency  pianobar seems incomplete without access to at least the important pandora radio features  i sent you an email by the way 
oh yes  yes it did  let me investigate my system 
yes  that patch fixed it  thanks 
hi  config is the one copied from github and i have this   the _echo  l_ is what i only added  i'm a beginner in bash so i'm not sure if it's the script can also be the problem  thanks 
not sure what happened  i thought i had git head at that point  i ran 'make clean' then 'make' and 'sudo make install' and it all worked just fine  i can't repeat that problem now

i removed the last post because it contained some private material  i can resend to you directly if you prefer   
nope  applying that patch did not do the trick what _did_ fix it was changing  however  that caused an architecture mismatch  c99 builds 32 bit binaries by default and i had installed libraries via brew  which probably uses the default architecture on my system  adding a " w 64" option to c99 to force it to build a 64 bit binary instead of a 32 bit one got it working  https   gist github com 883786
if i delete the control fifo at  home  user  config pianobar ctl and restart pianobar  the playback is continuous again  i'm going to ask jreese  the author of the script i'm using to control the fifo if he knows what's up  his github page  https   github com jreese pianobar python but i doubt it has anything to do with his script  because if i just run "touch  home    ctl" and run pianobar  i see this problem  did anything change in how you read the control fifo file

in the version of make i have  the    will override the environment variables which are set outside of that makefile  the openwrt cross compiling system depends on these to hand off the proper flags  in openwrt  they use a different compiler  or wrapper for the compiler  which is not c99 by default  so it needs the  std 99 flag  using wrappers for gcc is pretty standard from other cross compiling environments i have seen 
i don't think i'm behind a proxy  i don't have to configure anything proxy wise  as for audio format  i'm using whatever is default  i haven't configured anything special 
sorry  posted this in the wrong thread  will move to pianopub 
indeed  i shall work see whats up  however as said before if i play mixxx  or lmms while also running flash i can switch from the two  with pianobar i notice the inability to do this until pianobar is killed  on thu  nov 3  2011 at 1 06 pm  promyloph   reply reply github com wrote

sorry for the false alarm  it was indeed a network issue  k9 web protection program for parental control  the linux os was crunchbang in vm 
i applied that patch and it worked for me  thanks for the fast turn around on that  i might have patched it myself this weekend  but you're quicker 
i have both the proxy settings in pianobar set and http_proxy variables set 
look at the network traffic  when i pause a song downloading stops  unpausing does not cause it to resume  when i skip a song  next  downloading continues but there is no output and pianobar shows that the current time in the song isn't moving 
i recently installed pulseaudio so maybe it's using that  i don't have '   libao'  what do you recommend i try for default_driver

sorry  i forgot to explain that  after a long time listening i got the following message from pianobar  when i try to log in via web browser the pandora website return the following message  if i log in with another account it works normally  so  i assume they blocked my account 
i'd say in response to this  yea however  you bring up a good point with  in that case i'm inclined to agree  too bad    it would be great to have things like  songplay    songpause   and  durationremaining   etc   but it's not worth it in that case  thanks though  i still love  pianobar  as is    
so i looked at that earlier but i have no other problems with my connection at all  i did extensive testing to see if anything was wrong with it  this is on a raspberry pi and i have turned off ipv6 because that won't affect anything in my internal network  but i did that probably over a year ago and i've been using pianobar on it for a very long time without issue  no settings changed  this just started happening out of the blue  i was curious if others have been seeing it recently as well since my setup hasn't changed at all but pandora has been a bit weird for me lately  i'm also not getting the "trying next address" error  i'm getting the "connection timed out"  my connection to everything else is fine so i'm not sure what's happening here  i was hoping others might be experiencing it 
i'm using whatever version of pianobar is in the ubuntu 15 04 repos  i'm not sure how to check the version  i didn't have ffmpeg installed  i just rebuilt my machine recently  but this issue was happening back before my rebuild as well and i did have ffmpeg installed then   i have installed ffmpeg now to what is current in the ubuntu repos  ffmpeg  7 2 5 7 0ubuntu0 15 04 1 
it's definitely a bizarre issue  since i hadn't changed anything about my pianobar usage for a while i suspected it might be a server side thing  i can reproduce it for the 4 that i lost yesterday     "frankey   sandrino"     "french traditional radio"     "rjd2"     "wax taylor"  i can re add all of those when i start up pianobar and listen to music from them  but when i close and re open the application i get another  and the station is missing  i also lost a    "yoshida brothers"  station today while attempting to reproduce it 
oh  i forgot you have to have quickmix station selected before that  it would be a good idea to add that to the note  for example "not a quickmix station  please make sure quickmix station is selected " or something  thanks for the answer  works now

thanks for the suggestion  3 4 fails to build  missing linux perf_event h header file  but 4 1 built ok  this has allowed me to build the latest version of pianobar successfully 
don't worry  it's just an estimation given by company  i'll do test usage so the real life stats will be available  then i could do better proposals and or patches  thanks 
great news ari  i think we can keep the closed milestones on the calendar for reference  and maybe is easier to program  not sure   on a project should not be too many milestones on one month and we can already filter the project  can´t we  thanks 
well in our company  about 18000 employees  we have project management software  but they are all either too advanced and cumbersome to use or too simple aka  the confluence tasks  the problem with being too advanced means that everyone hates to use the software and neglects to bill correct times to the plan  the problem with too simple is that it is impossible to do any time tracking and project billing  thats where i think jobsworth could have an real advantage  niche  by being simple to use for regular users  but also more advanced for the hardcore planners  keep in mind that people hate to do stuff they shouldn't need to with the right software

it looks to me  like the problem is that the parse method expects params in the form of a normal get request from the url seperated by " "  key1 value1 key2 value2        instead it should expect a normal hash params from rails  or is it me that misunderstood something  the params hash i received from quickpay and tried to send through  activemerchant  billing  integration  quickpay  notification  new params   was  "msgtype"  "authorize"  "ordernumber"  "0133"  "amount"  "2500"  "currency"  "dkk"  "time"  "120320225554"  "state"  "1"  "qpstat"  "000"  "qpstatmsg"  "ok"  "chstat"  "000"  "chstatmsg"  "ok"  "merchant"  " company "  "merchantemail"  " email "  "transaction"  " transaction_id "  "cardtype"  "dankort"  "cardnumber"  "xxxxxxxxxxxx8050"  "md5check"  " md5_checksum "  "controller"  "checkout"  "action"  "callback"

looks like it's an ar issue  thanks for investigating  https   github com rails rails issues 22723
 yahonda i have check release17 which contains same bug  release18 master seem to be ok  i will submit a patch for release18 if this looks good 
ok  i will thanx   oooophh    i dont like google groups because of ugly interface and i dont understand why this feature is absent on github 
this is not really the point  once everything is indexed  the incremental index takes care of indexing  the real issue is when one wants to add another field to index  or changes the data  or any action that would require a full reindexing of the data  this does happen  whether we like it or not   the problem is that architecture of sunspot requires indexing through the rails  or ruby   which is slow  indexing millions of records can take days  at several hundred records per second   where as solr on its own can index at 10's of thousands of records per second  while sunspot is a very nice concept  i am not sure this is appropriate for large amounts of data   
thanks for the response  i am indeed using transactional fixtures however having that callback in my factory doesn't seem to work for me  the callback is working  it's the   index   method that i'm not having success with it  i tried calling it directly in my tests for my factories  and also had no luck with that  any ideas

after doing some test  i found out the condition that categories will disappeared  when the yaml front matter ends with       instead of         i made a mistake when i said i tested this  i thought i have  but either there's some other problem or i wasn't paying attention   the interesting thing is  even if the yaml front matter ends with        the categories page  http   0 0 0 0 5001 _categories  will then be empty  but at the end of the page those categories are there  if you need  i opened a testing repository in  ickc gitit test categories  https   github com ickc gitit test categories   the instance that categories has broken is when i did the last commit   changed yaml ending to        you can see from these 2 pages  1  http   0 0 0 0 5001 _categories 2  http   0 0 0 0 5001 test categories the former has nothing  the later has categories in the end   i attached my conf here  https   github com jgm gitit files 229038 default conf zip   where the only thing changed is the location of the wikidata

thanks ken  i have checked that i am using freetds 0 82  i will make the upgrade to 0 91 and test if everything works  this have to be next monday  because now i don't have access to the sql server  thanks 2011 9 2 metaskills   reply reply github com 
i'm really sorry ken  for now i'm just a blind kitten in ruby and rails     i'd love to  but googling tutorails isn't a quick way to mastering ruby    probably i'll try 
activescaffold  a 3rd party framework i am using is marshalling a largish ruby object in the session  i agree that this is dangerous  it works under mysql  which is what leads me to believe to that there is something that the adapter is doing that it shouldn't  but at the same time  it is dangerous to begin with  i am going to switch off of activescaffold instead of worry about this 
getting started on that now  i'm not sure if i should just use quote_table_name in with_identity_insert_enabled    or search for the problem elsewhere 
doesn't seem to be working for me without a  freetds conf  file  removing the  dataserver  configuration entry gives an error   was hoping this could work without only the  database yml  file  but not there yet 
unfortunately i think this issue is localized    i'm thinking the index was screwed up  i re synced the environment and it went away  i think something was whacky with a last sync i performed from prod data to dev data and when i did that it was screwy  hoping this issue stays away     sorry again 
i'm getting clarification on the problem  i think it might be on my end  will close if its my fault

sorry  figure this out  i removed the attr_writer in the model  it causes trouble  i do not know why this is causing trouble  maybe rails 4 changes how it acts 
i'm on ubuntu server 14 04  and i have the packages freetds bin  freetds common installed  with the version reporting as 0 91  going from the gem output though  it looks like tinytds is trying to load it's own version of freetds  1 0rc5
added in config application rb   activerecord  sessionstore  session table_name   'dbo sessions'  solved the problems  how can i set a general schema 'dbo '   activerecord  base table_name_prefix   'dbo '  does not work  thank you for your answer 
happy to help  it's better  but not quite there  everything seems to say that this attribute is now _datetimeoffset_  which is great  it even will keep from changing the timezone automatically on assignment  but something is happening when i actually save the object   prior to the current change  the timezone would get casted on assignment  just to check  i also tried using the  skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes  method  to see if that hook is appropriate  but the behavior was the same  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord timestamp html

i have one common callback for all models  i have tried to resolve the issue by disabling that callback but no luck  many of the models have no callback but issue is arising in those model's create update operation also 
appreciate your help even though it doesn't appear to be this gem  freetds was installed via homebrew  i've never encountered this before using freetds and this gem  i have an identical application with the exact same models  but using postgres as the database and this error doesn't happen  so i naturally thought it was due to the change to sqlserver 
just sent it to the mailing list  according to the prophecy   pre  setmathfont asana math otf   pre  did not work 
debian squeeze is using tl2009  maybe with some minor changes  in tl2010 i do not have the problem either and i think i am going to use it from now  however i had to install the i386 version to avoid  issue 96  http   github com wspr unicode math issues 96    just in case it turns the issue to be easily fixable   big   bigg  etc  are ignored as well 
i did  you find it at  http   gist github com 609545 meanwhile i realized that the problem is not directly related to unicode math  loading fontspec instead of unicode math creates the same problem  in fact i found that it is enough to load the eu1 fontencoding  this points to a bug in xetex 
it works perfect with the nightly build  thank you 
sorry  i forgot to add  usepackage lualatex math   btw  i'm afraid that with your patch  lualatex embeds the font twice  xelatex embeds it only once

i cant always prevent that some objects contain functions  should i copy and preprocess every object before i pass it to object toquerystring    
tim  thank you for explaining that  i think there's still an issue  though  my code above was awful  haha  so i wrote a more robust example here that you can copy paste into a  xhtml  i used the function      idea that you expressed in your last code example and still no dice   so if you click "feed the cow"  and the "ask the cow " he will still say he's not satisfied  when he should say he is  right

 swhiteman thanks for the prompt replay 👍 i don't get the whole picture myself  but the general idea is  i have a huge model that contains a time out function that handles updating items  so it will make the  xmlhttprequest  then updates the items 
i actually wish it didn't return to the default file when i save it   
typo 6 0 9 rails 3 0 10 rvm 1 8 5 ruby 1 9 2 i tried that commit and i got the same behavior  the fix for me was to replace app views articles _protected_article_content html erb with this line  playing around with the settings field in the contents table  setting it to 1  would fix it for the view but broke it for editing  changing that view file above fixed it for both editing and viewing

as i understand the spec  headers only start on blank new lines  in this case i'm interpreting that to be outside of lists  should they start inside lists as well  in the metaexample it's shown that gfm doesn't consider ul to be an area where markdown h1 would be rendered 
version 1 3 1 i tried your example in my terminal and i got the same result  however  when i build my site with jekyll  or when github does it   the output is still as described above      hmmm     i wanted to show you my markdown file  so i just made a gist  and it is displaying correctly     gist of the markdown in question  https   gist github com jeremy edward bauerle 2118b79c63e86afeae8b#file 2014 07 03 the first post md   but it's still not display correctly in the post itself    here  http   jeremy edward bauerle github io blog the first post    are gists still using maruku   i'm going to toy around with various parser to ensure that's the problem  
 gettalong it's not minimal  but close to  it's actually supposed to render some bootstrappy thing  https   gist github com morandat 64031638f916b2e0a1c6
agree  yet i am trying to reproduce the way github processes markdown for jekyll  we have documentation with a header   and the id on github is  propertysubpropertyvalue   to maintain correctness of anchor tags on both the html and github markdown  i was hoping to be able to select which spans to include or not include    or just have default behavior in this case be that like github 
ok  it isn't a wrong output it is more like a general problem of how kramdown treats    and doesn't recognize    sometimes you want math to be inline  like so    text   inline math here   other text   that's how stock mathjax works and produce effect like so    example  https   i gyazo com 38f538b23a0eaf05926ae515f7c6733a png  and sometimes you want display math bahaviour  in stock mathjax you would do    some text    display math    some text   and will receive this effect    example  https   i gyazo com b66760f3acc3c992e37af3abbab538f6 png  but becuase of kramdown only understands    and treat it as inline math all my math becomes inline  i know  of course  that you can wrap something in html block and tell kramdown to skip it during parsing  but it seems dirty and comlicated  is there a way to make kramdown differ   and    
i want to quote backtick  code     code    i'm using kramdown on jekyll  sorry for being late  #### input  #### expected output gfm   code     code  #### actual output kramdown with gfm input option   code      code 
you are right  when i view the actual source  it is nested  but it appears that safari un nests it in the inspect element box 
it certainly would 
it happens after clicking install  second screen after entering shop url   openssl 0 9 8r 8 feb 2011
i cleared the browser cache and cookies  tried in ff  chrome  and safari  all reproduce the same issue  i'm running  6 0 4  on a fresh rails build using the generators 
quick question   any setting i can update so that when i refresh the browser i don't have to sign in again  seems like i'm killing the session somehow   ok  back to the issue  yes  but if you look at the gem page here  https   github com shopify shopify_app and then go down to this section  shopifyapp  sessionrepository it still has this   class shop   activerecord  base def self store session  shop   self new domain  session url  token  session token  shop save  shop id end def self retrieve id  if shop   self where id  id  first shopifyapi  session new shop domain  shop token  end end end
i did run it and it is what i have at config initializers shopify_session_repository rb
  create an app with certain scopes and install it to a store   change scope of the app and deploy   go back to store to login and you are not redirected to authorization screen to give permission to new scopes
yes  i did corrected the scope but still same issue  i havent tried locally because the redirect will have issues so i push to heroku and install from there  the app installed but redirected with that message  the app wont open from the store either

wow  yes it's working by upgrading  activeresource  with version  activeresource     5 0 0    thanks 
actually  i determined that it works fine if you disable the embedded app functionality 
yikes it was on a fairly large project that i haven't looked at in quite a while  it was running 2 3 4  i resolved the problem by using the btelles faker fork if that helps 
it does fix the problem  though i'm wondering why this gem has to be added  because it's already in rails 
i am not using faker in a rails app   it is a simple ruby script   is enough to reproduce the problem 
yeah thats the main reason i asked  i didn't know if there were ai gems that reverse engineered nlp concepts to construct sentences based upon provided syntax points  for example  you could provide the verb  sentence   faker  conversation sentence verb  "run"     "i went for a run today" faker  conversation reply context  sentence     "really  i went for a run yesterday " if it does not exist  it could be an interesting project  but i'm trying to think if there are other potential applications to make it worth the effort  i think it probably goes outside the scope of faker  my initial thought is that it will be easier to just construct these manually for now 
it's in the project folder  so   sites project lib locales en gb yml
perhaps writing a script to find all end points in the yml located here  https   github com stympy faker blob master lib locales en yml and calling   length  on each element to get the length of each end array could be an option 
 faker  date between 1 month ago  time now  no_weekends  will not give you a date that is saturday or sunday one month ago for example or  faker  date between 1 month ago  time now  weekdays  will only give you dates that are mondays to fridays
 vbrazo  sushant12 this problem caused in faker 1 9 3  i solved this problem by upgrading gem version
it is not loading  yml files from faker's lib locale i had the same problem with english  and i'm using redmine  eventually what worked for me  is having stuff from en folder appended to en yml file in redmine's  config locale en yml and removing en  and leaving only one faker  then nesting other translations below it  then it worked properly    but the conclusion is it's not loading  yml files from it's folder  if app already has i18n done  the way redmine 4 has it   
i would love to do that  but i'm not very good with the build system  i'll look into it to see if it is something i can attempt 
happens in at least chrome  15 0 874 106  and firefox  6 0 2

just booting the server and signing in  i fixed it in the preference model by putting in  attr_accessible   but then it came up in the next model to be initialized  so i just disabled the option in  application rb   this was with rails 3 2 8  in particular  the first error happened on line 127 of the user model when trying to initialize a new preference 
that is correct   only an issue if you try to 'select contact' for a contact that already has an account  i'd also find multiple accounts per contact useful  however it would need to be clear in the ui when i am adding another account to a contact as opposed to moving a contact to another account

this is vanilla fat free crm  downloaded as the zipfile  i haven't changed anything except for the ruby version  i also  as i understand it  cannot create directories and install anything other than the gems and plugins that are part of the application setup  i doubt i can correct the path on heroku  i assume unicorn is installed as a gem on ffcrm  i didn't get any time today to look at this  i think the best thing at this stage may be to delete the application and start again 
fresh install of ffcrm  created a personal list  saved it    and boom  it seems to do the save  because the list entry shows up  but clicking on it any time will hit the error 
i semmons  just installed edge money   money new 1212 45 to_d 100  to_s    "1212 45" seems to work fine  thank you for response 
1 9 3 and money gem 4 0 1 sweet  sounds like an upgrade will fix it  should have thought to check that first  thanks semmons99 
i don't understand your second question  yet    my need is  inherited and overridable amounts  i need a nil amount to state that this entry doesn't override the default value provided by a parent  schedule  record  i deal with recurring amounts   when the amount is nil  the app will retrieve the default amount via the parent record instead  is the code i provided good enough to achieve that or are there any know caveats

hi   thanks for the help   money infinite_precision    was   working  i was just using money rails which used an integer to back the value and was therefore losing precision  i ended up defining a custom currency with more significant digits and it's working well 
oops  i just noticed the last example of the  currency exchange  https   github com rubymoney money#currency exchange  block   seems like   it's already possible   to do what i was asking for  it didn't work for me last time i tried  maybe it was just something wrong with my code  i'll check again and re open if i find a bug   semmons99 i was talking about actually converting but behind the scenes by checking the exchange rate on the default bank  which seems like it's already been implemented 
i totally hear you on that  and i can provide some help in doing so  also  there's another unmentioned option  which is to pull in the code into money itself  since there's already some data redundancy between the two in terms of symbols and currencies 
for some reason  the same money euro 12345678  format returns something like this  pry main   money new 123456789  "eur"  format    "€1 234 567 89" i guess maybe because my default locale is "en_us"  in that case  because there are many other things in my repo that depend on the default locale  so i have to pass in the separator and mark explicitly 
yeah  unfortunately  #max  and  #min  are implemented in c code  here's  #max  for instance   from  https   github com ruby ruby blob 9b94249f39bff401465340639bed1f2a93b62ebf enum c i'm not familiar enough with ruby's c code to really grasp what's going wrong  i do know this code is ultimately calling  money#     though  and that this method is working as expected  i agree it's no biggy  just to ensure the array is all  money  objects before hand  that's how i'm working around it   it's just that this really caught me off guard because all the other comparison methods             etc   work fine with a mixture of  money  objects and plain numbers  the fact that  #max  and  #min  _don't_ work as expected  definitely breaks the   "rule of least surprise"    which probably isn't a good thing when working with financial transactions 
nope  i think it's settled 
thank you for your reply  i am using  money  bank  googlecurrency new   the exchange rate is correct  bank get_rate "hkd"  "vnd"  to_f   #    2884 5162  correct however  money new 1  'hkd'  exchange_to 'vnd'  cents   #    28  wrong
for our project we're hoping to let customers make up their own currencies on the fly  kind of like virtual currencies   calling  register  is possible but it would mean extra database queries at the top of each request to determine which currencies to register  each of our customers would have different currencies and will be hundreds across the platform  regarding 2  i did notice some issues when i registered currencies without  subunit_to_unit  so i'm guessing i'd need to find a way to set defaults for un registered currencies  monkey patching may be our best option  unless you're aware of any other way we could accomplish this 
hey  printercu  as said  we already have these  money   money zero  lines in our code base  as      0  wasn't possible at the time we put them in  and i wanted to avoid having to change them  and it was kind of unexpected change in behaviour for        so i thought maybe others might suffer from this as well  admittedly    negative   reads way better and seems to have been in existence for ages  so might end up just changing it to this instead     thank you 
yes  that worked 👍  printercu  thoughts on if  sign_negative  should exist too

store key in db and display values with translations make sense  if key and value is always one one tied  in my case  i need   it works naturally on the record edit page  nice coding  but the filter does not  it only supports hash  and i am not sure if there is other places  i think support of array in array is a good feature to have  thanks 
thanks for the quick response  since the operator of the admin page will be a non english speaker  it is desirable to have the menus in there language  and because the language is a 2byte character one  it is not possible to have model and action names changed to fit them

yes  i tried with a datetime format  thinking it was trying to perhaps format using the string  but same result 
well  that small exercise you asked made me get to the solution  i progressively created a small application with the same configurations i have  in my application i was using other default language instead of the default  "pt"  but the standard for portuguese for portugal is "pt pt"  i have adminuser's in my administration  since they have a locale preference  and that was set to portugal portuguese  "pt pt"  the application couldn't resolve the correct yml locale file  so  i corrected my default locale to "pt pt" and all thinks work again  ## although this is not a bug  i think the documentation should be more complete and detailed  it was a mistake to not use a standard i18n language type  if the user doesn't follow the standard  all things will work in the rails application  but if we had typus  with his default locales  some problems will occur  keep the good work 
there are arguments to be made on both sides but overall i think i prefer to keep everything in one place  having said that i suppose an argument can be made that permissions should go in the controller too 
rails 3 1 1  typus 3 1 5  everything works if i add integer_filter helper from there  https   github com fesplugas typus pull 303
for example  if page needs to include separate css and js and topbar submenu 
i guess that would be sufficient  however i would prefer it be per application  config is global  right    although not needed in my case  someone else might wish to run multiple servers on different ports

it was my problem  not webpy's  i didn't change the appropriate term in my html code from 'input' to 'textarea ' if there is a way to delete this whole issue request  we probably should do so 
i'm sorry  but i have since then moved away from web py to flask  unfortunately   what i do remember is that the core issue seems to be that web py uses a slurped wsgiserver from cherrypy and the issues were in there  in cherrypy they've turned that server into a standalone project  cheroot  https   github com cherrypy cheroot  so also switching web py to that should probably fix the issue  i think i remember seeing a note from the cherrypy people that they separated out the wsgiserver specifically because various projects were using it without using the rest of cherrypy  like web py  
i think this may have been an issue in what i wrote  i am closing for now but if it occurs again  i will re open  thanks for your help 
the first two errors reported are indeed generated in that way  the last one is triggered when raising an exception inside any render function when running a frontend application
assuming that your are using the development server that comes with web py and the access log is being printed  is that correct  yes  exactly  that and fix if required  http   webpy org cookbook logging i don’t say it’s wrong  maybe i miss something  generally speaking i found such solution in a few articles on reddit and generally speaking it seemed that following the cookbook is a right way to turn off the logging  or at least printing it  
yes  just noticed it's already raised by other guy before  and i found the solution there  thanks

you're correct  it's related to the redirect  if i use   it won't return any content  just the headers  i guess that even with a redirect it should only return the headers  no  i can try to work on a pr if this is a bug and not the intended behavior

it happens with parts named 'body' or named something else  after further digging  the key difference between your test case and mine is that in yours  the repetition happens in the global context  in mine  it happens one level down  inside of a named part  what's happening in the case i described    the layout wants to render the body part  the global context has no rendered parts list  so it starts one and adds 'body'    the body part wants to render the extended part  it inherits the rendered parts list from the layout context  and adds 'extended'    the body part wants to render the extended part again  it inherits the rendered parts list from the layout context  and 'extended' is already there  so it falsely detects recursion  in the test case you linked to    the global context renders an unnamed string  and so never creates a rendered parts list    the unnamed string wants to render the body part  and has no rendered parts list  so it starts one and adds 'body'    the unnamed string wants to render the body part again  and still has no rendered parts list  the previously created one was thrown away with the first body part's context   so it starts one and adds 'body'  i may not be getting all the terminology right  but the point is  the rendering parts stack isn't strictly local  and so it doesn't automatically get popped when the tag locals stack is  my previous fix gets the job done  but here's one that  a  uses tag globals  since you're sharing the data structure once you get into part rendering anyway  and  b  integrates better with your existing test case

i stand corrected  thank you  still  if there isn't an issue with doing a local 'tmp'  or 'tmp' plus random number to prevent collisions   it would be easier to write cross platform code  rather than having to detect the system and then use different environment variables depending on platform 
i feel like something like that is more appropriate in the method_option line since that's where the arg is getting passed in  i want to manipulate it  bam  done  it's not a show stopper by any means  just nice to have 
hi maxmeyer  we had noticed that  but our heuristic consider all the development history 
because that's what the  options  hash is constructed from  when i want to extract values from it  with  #slice   and pass it into my own libraries that provide their own default options  with  #reverse_merge     it gets corrupted 
sure i'll have a look
what would it take to make it work  can we ask #neo4j for a method for this  destroying and recreating a new relationship under the hood transparently would be a pretty bad idea    where is start_node  used now  does it need to exist  private and or exception sound like a good answer
yes i believe i have the configuration properly in place  i have the following three gems in my gemfile gem 'neo4j community'  '1 9 m03' gem 'neo4j advanced'  '1 9 m03' gem 'neo4j enterprise'  '1 9 m03' i have the two required lines in my application rb and in my development rb i have the following statements config neo4j 'enable_ha'  true config neo4j 'ha server_id'  1 config neo4j 'ha server'    'localhost 6001' config neo4j 'ha coordinators'    'localhost 2181 localhost 2182 localhost 2183' config neo4j 'ha cluster_server'    'localhost 2181'

not yet    figured it was such a small thing that i would just add the issue  however  i can try and put together a pr in the next day or so  on mar 5  2013  at 12 32 pm  andreas ronge notifications github com wrote

 cheerfulstoic thank you for the naming suggestion  but i'm a little bit confused  are you suggesting to change the association direction  it's only a semantic detail  by my point of view  saying that a user owns a post and post is_owned_by a user seems more expressive than user things_owned a post and a post has owner a user  what do you think   subvertallchris   what is your opinion here  by the way  i must learn to close opened issue when solved  sorry    
well  i'm having some strange behaviours like the one above  i restarted the machine and that error disappeared  but  i added the latest part of the query and the result was not as expected  without raising exceptions   the difference is in the  where  i r object    i_r_object     why the parameter name in the first query includes the initial  i    if i remove the initial i  it succeeded  2 options  1  my fault in the query or 2  an error in the parm name generator 
sure  in the mean time it can be reprod by simply doing the following anyobject find  name    "any text"  #returns nil without error  since it does not exist in the db  anyobject create  name    "any text"  anyobject find  name    "any text"  #errors out
for the following yml
yes  name and email property is defined in user model  but when i pass params object into new method  its initialize params with empty hash  why  
ok i thought it was still in place  so we use create_rel instaed   if this is consistent  should i add a section "how we add undeclared rels" to the wiki here  https   github com andreasronge neo4j wiki neo4j v3 declared relationships
   rake neo4j install edition env  
actually  yes  as a new user of the api i was expecting where and rel_where to accept the same parameter changing only their underlying context node and relationship  respectively   i think rel_like would be a better name here because what you are sending as parameter is an example of what you expect
in my case  i have several relations between same object with same properties  e g  two records for '4 sep'  student1   visited  date  '1 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '2 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '4 sep'     math   student1   visited  date  '4 sep'     math  need to remove 1 specific record  okay  now developer can add unique index to date  though it is sort of headache  and what if business logic actually allows to visit lesson two times a day  morning evening  this is   not mandatory   to work with relations in each app architecture  but it often happens  another example is some roles like this   john   repairer    bike's garage   john   senior repairer    car's garage   john   manager    car's garage  yes  on web form of relationship management we can add logic  which will filter by 1  person id 2  place id 3  role name this is instead of simple search by role id  this adds certain headache to developer  how should i filter  if +filter by role name will be enough  or need to see if there is another properties  customer told  that there might appear role ranks   1  5   how it will reflect on business logic later  gosh   instead of simple search by role id    and ruby by itself is designed to save developer from headaches  what is required in described examples  is  match     r   uuid   rel_uuid         return r and if relationships will be indexed   nothing scary in such request  it will be probably even more efficient  than 1  lookup through nodes a  2  then through nodes b  3  and then find relations between them yes  they cannot be indexed by schema index  strange why  though maybe it will be implemented in future in neo4j   though legacy indexes and auto indexes allow to index relationships  http   neo4j com docs stable auto indexing html http   neo4j com docs stable indexing relationships html maybe it is not easy to implement in neo4jrb now and schema indexes preferable  but except technical issues i don't see for now why relationship ids aren't desirable  why neo4jrb should prevent usage of intuitive convenient logic
ah  sorry  destroy  works  i was confused by old docs  https   github com neo4jrb neo4j wiki neo4j  rails persistence#destroy and delete and wasn't able to find in new docs how to delete records 
yes  it can wait  i was planning to work on a feature i'm building using active job sometime early next week 
thanks brian  actually i was able to solve the issue by using  as a default fallback message in my  code en yml  code  file   after reading the other thread comments decided to post it here in case the recommended fix makes sense  i e  however i'm aware that both devise   simple_form are plataformatec's gems and thus very tied to active record  please close the issue if the fix doesn't make sense for neo4jrb   in any case i'll be doing some tests with formtastic in order to review if it's better suited for activenode  can you please point to some   emberjs   examples  
hi  not sure how to do that  the only eager loading documentation i was able to found is http   neo4jrb readthedocs org en latest activenode html#eager loading but it seems on per request bases  cheers  david
yes i included the concern after the neo4j  activenode  but anyway  thanks to  subvertallchris  you solution worked perfectly   y 
hi brain  the returning method works with the count as strength  which orders the highest correlating users  but i'm having troubling accessing the enumerable after the return  trying to figure the best way to deal with the problem  most likely some kind of map method from neo4j core  on tue  jul 14  2015 at 12 51 pm  brian underwood notifications github com wrote 
ok  i'v changed the version  i've tested more versions before posting and forget to change back   i've changed the config neo4j session_path to 'http   localhost 7474' instead the local ip and now it works  thanks for the quick response 
you were absolutely right  it was this line  passing symbols solved the issue  i think we should update the documentation  https   github com neo4jrb neo4j wiki neo4j 3a 3aactivenode
hi  progm thanks   this is what we were using   do you think we are in the clear to make the switch to the new branch 
it makes perfect sense  thanks for taking the time to explain  i also see your conundrum  in order to print a warning  you would effectively have to respond to the idea that the gem is being run in a rails project  which creates an explicit coupling to rails  i suppose you could print such a warning whenever a command is forwarded to neo4j rake_tasks   but i suppose the most reasonable way to deal with this would be to just put a line somewhere in the docs 
yes  thanks for your swift response as always

this was the reason why the shortname was added  thank you  would be nice if there at the bridge settings would be an option to allow message from the webpage to be sent without shortname  maybe it would help to change the text from  prefix message subjects with the   to  always prefix message subjects with the      
in our list  the default setup is to send all messages to moderation there is no exception just to make sure the messages are not sent accidentally  so  if i am sending a message to the group  i have to wait for other moderators to approve  but we don't need that situation  i can review  similar to preview  my message and approve it if everything looks good 
 davglass hmm  when running on my local server using my own comboloader  even though it receives the correct response  200   it still downloads the css 3 times  when i inspect the requests in firebug  i can confirm that indeed  the response is sent correctly and a status code of 200 was used 
thanks for you quick response  you inspired me  here is my old code  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel get 'id'   modifyrowmodel    finally i updated to this  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel get 'id'   modifyrowmodel getattrs      now it works like a charm  but if we can use like this  datatable modifyrow modifyrowmodel    that would be wonderful 
i will do pull request in the future  gotta become more familiar with forking yui  sorry about that  just a small change should have been made a simple pull request by myself  
probably caused by the same bug  but i can't tell  i don't mind merging this ticket into #1343 as long as it's addressed 
yes  we can't do anything about it    it is a mozilla bug  i tested the raw event for the expected zero and concluded that information was lost in event facade or on the way to it  the fact is that it is always zero  "the button and detail properties only apply to the mouse button related events  not mouse movement events  for the mousemove event  for example  both properties will be set to 0 " https   developer mozilla org en us docs xul tutorial more_event_handlers redirectlocale en us redirectslug xul_tutorial 2fmore_event_handlers the solution they suggest is to account for what buttons are pressed on  mousedown   that's not easy to do in yui  is it  at any rate  i would prefer these properties to be undefined  rather than incorrect 
yes  it affects 3 10 3  here's a simple test case  https   gist github com brunobasto 6002949#file testing yui 3 10 3 custom events wildcard would be nice if you guys were able to include that in 3 11 0  thanks for the quick answer  satyen 
i don't think this is new behaviour but i can check  i just ran into another regression so i need to go back anyway  i'm using a global io header mechanism  this mechanism is bypassed in an io form scenario when upload   true  yui add 'msa io'  function y    var origio   y io  globalheaders      '0 0 1'    requires    'io base'  'event custom'      
yeah  i'll do that  give me a little bit to set that up  what do you think about it for the other components  though 
you should scroll down to the end  when the scrollbar bounces back  the issue happen  i use ipad 2 with ios 6 1 3  here is screenshot    image  https   f cloud github com assets 414082 1104135 6834d6cc 18e5 11e3 8f2e 189f3e02cd51 jpg 
i assumed you guys were trying to get away from using flash all together  so i suggested removing references to using the flash component in the examples  so new people don't get tied up with it

i should probably explain more what i was am trying to do    i have a repo of yui3 modules which i want to be able to build and test on it's own  without the need to link to our  non yui  combo service  i can run the tests via  grover  if i install copy of yui3 in this repo  so rather than ask each dev to checkout yui3 i wanted it to be automatic on  npm install  of the repo dev packages  so i tried via npm  as you said  i can simply  npm install yui   but this seems to give a slightly different tree to what's in yui yui3 build  and installing via the github url gives the above error  installing via bower makes more sense  to me anyway  in that i want yui3 the front end lib not yui3 the nodejs lib  it also seems to install quicker  and most importantly it works   
hello  unfortunately  this is still an issue for me  i can show it a web conference if needed  please let me know  thanks  sridhar
 okuryu  thank you for the response  i'll file an issue on the correct repository 
yep  that would solve this particular issue 
hey  thanks for the answer  i tried sleep already  but didn't work  the funny thing is  that the same tests actually work on my colleagues machines  and indexing works perfectly in development environment in my app  any ideas what could be wrong too  
the "rescue" does not work within my application  too  here is a simplified snippet of code   despite the "rescue" the exception is raised  btw  the option "ignore_errors" is working fine  but i want to catch errors by myself  my environment    ruby 1 8 7  2010 12 23 patchlevel 330   i686 darwin10    rails 2 3 10   sphinx 0 9 9 release  r2117    thinkingsphinx 1 4 1
ok  so it is defiantly that line  i tried that code out and had the same problem  i then changed the code to  where "active   true and expiration   # time now to_formatted_s  db  "  and got a new error 
i'm getting     i think the  match '  '   is the culprit   but not sure how to remove it 
not really   and now its consistent   the first request it errors out  and after that its fine 
its rake ts index
btw  this line also gives an error of column does not exist   the first column name is not surrounded by double quotes 
thnks pat  and i am sorry that i wasted your time  this is the old logic that i used before sphinx and has nothing to do with the sphinx  there is search method that's conflicting with it  sorry 
sure  'undefined method define_index' rails  v 3 2 9 thinking sphinx latest release  sphinx 2 0 5 the active_record model class is gl  account rails_env development if i refresh a few times on the page where the error occurs i get a new error  undefined method  key ' for nil nilclass the trace is a framework trace and no application trace exists  actionpack  3 2 9  lib action_controller metal hide_actions rb 36 in visible_action ' on jan 7  2013  at 9 21 am  pat allan notifications github com wrote

heh  you're fast  i found the issue  and it's my application's fault  not ts's  i'm not completely familiar with this codebase  but the model in question had a  set_property  min_infix_len    3  attribute set 
thank you   that fixed it  is there any way to reference a field conditionally based on class  edit  i e  some of the fields in the "polymorphically" associated classes are different 
hi pat  i had run ts rebuild  but doing it again produces an error  error  index 'site_core'  sql_range_query  error  function array_agg   does not exist line 1     al_class"  0 as "sphinx_deleted"  array_to_string array_agg       hint  no function matches the given name and argument types  you might need to add explicit type casts   dsn pgsql   postgres     localhost 5432 ppe_development   which is a bit odd because it's a perfectly valid postgres function  could this be to do with the fact that it's interfacing to searchd as mysql 
 pat thanks for replying yes i do have cron jobs scheduled using whenever gem  but none of them are relevant to thinking_sphinx except  i assume  searchd  is fine here
i have this errors approxinmatelly one per day  but i use sphinx only in admin panel  not in users interface  i will install monit and send you logs after i get results 
 +1  cool response   and i can confirm that this is resolved  
i actually rewrote  to_param    even if i commented out the  to_param  method  it's still the same  i'm sorry to have gotten so many errors  thanks

 pat i use    rails 4   thinking sphinx v3 1 4 and in model i define like this 
 pat we're at latest setup  i think   sphinx 2 2 11  and  ts   3 3 0   the thing that it has worked until recently  we're trying to backtrack everything step by step but with no success yet  do you think it's remotely possible that timezone and locale could interfere with this 
i've tried to isolate the problem to be able to reproduce it  but no luck so far  the project runs rails 3 2 22 2  it works fine on ruby 2 1 and 2 2  but not on ruby 2 3  in the glance_search gem it just works  tried with rails 3 2 22 2 and rails 4 2   i'll investigate further 
first  thank you all contributors and you pat for this project    it's cool gem  and second  thank you for fast answer and fix this issue  all work fine  ps  side effect   mmm    i monkeypatch ar batches#find_in_batches default batch_size 1000    50  and several script in my project changed not good  it's was day not good solutions  we will not remember it    for future may be made "batch_size" option of "thinkingsphinx  index define"  example   popular news site  we have article model  small count  huge content   need small batch_size we have comment model  huge count  small content   need big batch_size
thanks for quick answer  pat it would be great to add mention about automatic invoking and maybe even example how to do it with every deploy  or maybe only when thinking_sphinx config changes if that is even possible  yes  i'm using shared paths  here is my ts config 
sometimes once every few days  sometimes more  i didn't notice any exact periodicity  sphinx  3 0 3 mysql  i don't have access to the server now  so i don't know the mysql version  thinking sphinx  4 0 i got a call from a customer describing a problem  a few hours later he said that the site was already working  this means that the connection was first lost  and then appeared  i looked at the cron and saw there the periodic re indexation  it is possible that reindexing somehow restarted sphinx  or thinking sphinx 
edge rails from two days ago  some commit yesterday broke view rendering for me  
we're using formtastic 9 8 with rails 2 3 8  we're not using the rails_xss plugin 
http   pastie org 1044987
it works with the wrapper 
in this example i have project has_many tasks and a lot of unassigned tasks  i'd like to enter id's of tasks  that may be found for example with autocomplete  and submit to application  currently it's submitting as string  is there any way to submit as array 
it is erroring on line 424 which is not rescued  try testing it again with a single attribute and pass an object to semantic_form_for  pre   code  class foo attr_accessor  attr end   code    pre  this works   pre   code     semantic_form_for  foo   url    ' ' do  f         f inputs  attr       end      code    pre  this errors   pre   code     semantic_form_for foo new   url    ' ' do  f         f inputs  attr       end      code    pre  which is expected since the symbol fails the conditional check on line formtastic rb 423 and is rescued on line formtastic rb 426  but when passed an object it passes the conditional check and gets the undefined method error since it is not rescued on line formtastic rb 424  hope that helps 
i created this example  schema rb create_table "posts"   force    true do  t  t string "title" t text "body"     end app controllers posts_controller rb def index  search   post search params  search    posts    search all end app views posts index html erb    semantic_form_for  search do  f         f input  title_eq        f buttons       end    when i try to go to http   localhost 3000 posts i get this error  undefined method  new_record ' for #class 0xb5f6a094
never written any     i'll definitely add asap  can you point me to a good primer 
that is probably the cause  i was working with another package that wanted url things capitalized so i set the inflector  i am going to mark this closed as it's probably to much of an edge case to bother worrying about 
add_column  members   interests   string created field shows  displayed as text          ""   "workshops"   ""   ""   landscape   ""   ""   "" when above formtastic line is in the edit view file  none of the checkboxes are checked 
your first guess was right   i had just changed the default language and let an empty i18n file  silly me   sorry for the noise  and keep up the good work 
it is true  i was calling "form semantic_fields_for  user company do  company "  when it should have been "form semantic_fields_for  company do  company "  sorry  this issue can be closed 
i am using ubuntu 10 04 and firefox 3 6 6   didnt try other browsers os' so far  think that makes a difference 
i'm not sure why it's happening on my system  but i can stop it happening by adding " lib    false" to the config gem line  is it normal practice for rails init rb to require the library  isn't that usually handled by the rails gem loading code  which makes line 2 of that file redundant  also  by the time that init rb file is loaded  is it reasonable to assume the formtastic lib  dir is on the load path  that would mean the line could be changed to just "require 'formtastic'" which would avoid the file being loaded a second time 
thank you  it worked   i had  symbol in my form  can you try in the code to instantiate a  object from a  symbol and thus overcome this issue  
rails 3 0 0  ruby 1 9 2  formtastic rails3  0 9 10 0   hmmm seems to be an old formtastic version  i think i will go to 1 1 0 and try again 
yes  this work with 1 2 1beta  btw it is rails 1 9 2  rails 3  thanks 
i'm currently outputting checkboxes in a grid format for a setting hours open for a restaurant  the x axis is for days and the y axis is for time in increments of 15 minutes  so the checkbox is for an attribute named is_open  checking a box for a particular day and time means that restaurant is open for that time slot  with the field type being a boolean and the two x y describing the checkbox there is really no need for a label  of this is a has_many relationship and these are nested attributes  can't really see this applying any other way 
i think you could do it in two steps    # do the dumb approach  as you suggested     which gives allows us the ability to do things easily  # later do the "smart" thing  which amounts to a working "stack" or perhaps a simple rule  like  if in a form input  then wrap in li    true   makes it easier to move to the eventual solution  but certainly  it was a "surprise" when it didn't work 
heh  my fault  will edit it right now to work fine  thought  errors  work the same as  errors full_messages   but it's not  the difference  for example  some locales could have errors format set to    message    and in current version it will print out  name name is blank    so it's not correct  or you want to have    attribute     name    right now it's impossible without monkey patching the  semanticformbuilder  or creating own builder  may be i'm wrong    but right now i miss some features like  https   rails lighthouseapp com projects 8994 tickets 3768 patch add full_message option to validations but those features it totally related to active_model

sorry i forgot to specify  rails 3 1 0rc4 ruby 1 9 2  linux  formtastic 2 0 0rc3

"studies show that those side by side inputs  as opposed to a nice uniform series of labels and widgets  actually perform way worse in user testing " you are operating on outdated info there  or you aren't thinking of specific cases where it makes sense  like with an expiration date  credit card numbers and security codes  for too general of an accusation to make  either way it seems like  wrapper_html    false is a logical feature but we basically went with your #2 response before reading this  thanks for the response 
it's common to give the listed element unique ids for javascript manipulation  formtastic uses fieldsets inside a wrapper li input for nested records   something like that anyway  thanks for your response  ryan
ok  and how can i put html in the  hint attribute 
im new in rails  so i didnt patched anything   s im using gem 'formtastic' gem 'formtastic bootstrap' is it what u meant  
simple  i wanted to access form element  i wanted to append some html to it  so needed handle to it  though i had single form on the page  wanted to have a clear way to select it  so found  namespace would assign id _ namespace  to it  but not found working  i ended up using   "form formtastic"

what perms are needed  i actually created a new new app with 3 20 mojo and it works fine  i am using  debian squeeze 6 0 4 perl 5 14 2   perlbrew  original app generate by mojolicious 2 98 i think it may be a fact that the app was generated by old version  on sun  aug 5  2012 at 2 06 pm  marcus ramberg   reply reply github com
then it is more a unix fork design problem rather than a perl problem  imho  rand   is crucial and i suppose many modules use it internally  there is no safe way of keeping developers from stepping into this pitfall 
i think that to avoid security and other risks you should give for endpoint mojo user the feature to configure hidden method like    app  routes  your_has_name_allow_action qr   x ac00   x d7af       then the  line 53  https   github com kraih mojo blob aea16c61fd730a14053539332707ff3f770e7277 lib mojolicious routes pm#l53  would be like   return     h    method     index  method  '_'     0       method      a z         endpointuser_allow_qr     method      endpointuser_allow_qr        
well  mojo could try rename   itself and if it fails use a non blocking copy via it's ioloop
sorry for the misleading wording  it's the helper 'dumper' coming with mojolicious  plugin  defaulthelpers 
 jhthorsen we have 9000+ routes in our app  i have created a small example app with   mojo generate app and added this to myapp pm  here is the resulting flame graph     http   i imgur com ujsktbm png  we make 100 request for each of the 100 last routes  so we have 1  cache miss and 99  hits but the run time is dominated by mojolicious  routes  lookup which is used in the miss case 
yes  it was chromium queueing requsts to the same url  the case is closed  everything works as expected here 
well  now i'm not sure if i'm reading the spec right  rfc 3986  3 3 paths  says which is backwards from what i initially read it as  i was assuming this was to account for things like the protocol relative css usage  but it's the other way around  so apparently the url  is  valid  which means mojo definitely shouldn't be returning the first bite of path as the hostname  and dropping the real hostname   so i amend my initial expectation  the path should be returned as "  fred fish" since that's allowable   hmm  https   stackoverflow com a 20524044 reads the rfc backwards too  so it's not just me   it comes out of the regex okay so i'm wondering if the double slashes are triggering another call to mojo  url  but i haven't poked deeply into that 
i mean  doesn't it depend what you mean by "normalized"  that's a bit of a subjective term  normalized in terms of what  what's normal here  if you think this is the right way for things to be  i guess that's fine  but it's a change from how things worked before  and it is not clear from the overall context of this commit that it was actually intended  the whole sequence of commits is a bit tricky to understand  since it seems to involve removing this "verbose mode" then putting it back again  so i figured i'd just file an issue so you can check whether it's intentional and desired or not 
when your app does something memory intensive but not very often  so you lower  accepts  value to release memory back to the os  afaik this  or memory leakage  is the primary use case for similar setting in other web servers  e  g   httpd's maxconnectionsperchild  https   httpd apache org docs current mod mpm_common html#maxconnectionsperchild   in my case setting  accepts  to 10 resulted in several dozens core dumps a day on a modest 2 rps 
my plan was to factor out the important bit of  json_has  and reuse that to decide whether to spit out an alternative message 
imho  warnings in this use case has no sense  i know it is easy to avoid them  but if the meaning of this function is cleaning blanks  the warnings are useless  i could understand better if there are only one warning message from the caller perspective  not the internals of this sub 
i looked further into this issue and it has nothing to do with factory girl  ruby 1 9 chokes on non ascii characters by definition  i overcome this by putting  # encoding  utf 8 as the first line of every file that had non ascii characters 
 file exists   will return true but the file cannot be loaded using that same path  on windows  
yes  joe    i'm sorry  i looked for a way to delete but couldnt find one 
i don't think so but i really don't know much about the pickle or factorygirl code  i just found that some cucumber features stopped working for me and i narrowed it down to the latest factory_girl  the deprecation warning also was a tip off   we might need to consult with some of the core maintainers of pickle to be sure of what is best  it might be helpful to still have a #factories method on the registry that did not return the sequences but ultimately you have a better idea of what your api should offer

strange  i just grepped the factorygirl source and found no securerandom  i also removed the deprecation silencers from my project and am no longer seeing the warnings i remember seeing when i opened this issue  i guess this issue is closed 
adding  rake  to gemfile with  require  false  doesn't solve the problem  as you can see rails is doing it internaly  https   github com rails rails blob 3 0 stable railties lib rails application rb#l213 so there is no easy way for workaround  i'm pretty sure that this will break lot of applications tests  because there are bunch of methods that can be often used as attributes in activerecord models  i e   task    rule   etc  method_missing is evil    
hmm    looks like going from factory_girl_rails 1 0 1 to 1 1 0 seems to have fixed the issue  i'm going to close the issue 
i have factory_girl  2 0 4  and factory_girl_rails  1 1 0   and they were up to date before the rails upgrade 
yes  i can create a new obj with customer new  the problem disappeared after the dependency on factory_girl_rails  by factory_girl  was dropped and factory   was replaced with factory build    somehow factory_girl developed dependency on factory_girl_rails in my system  still don't know why   with factory_girl installed  gem check required factory_girl_rails to be installed  however when both factory_girl and factory_girl_rails installed  they generated conflict with duplicate error  after hours of failed tries  the conflict dependency mysteriously disappeared after rebooting and reloading the system  thanks 
i'm aware of overrides and traits  but alas they don't seem to solve the problem i'm trying to address  specifically  i don't want to load up n factories when only a tiny handful of these will ever be used in a given test  the fact that my tests must load a number of factory files before i can do anything is a little disappointing  i like it when my tests are isolated and are as explicit as possible about their structural dependencies  having this would be a bonus because i'd get all the usefulness that factorygirl provides and yet still be assured that i wouldn't load anything beyond what was minimally necessary for the test to run  the answer may just be "well  that's not how factorygirl works right now  sorry"  and that's fine too  i can still use it with workarounds  but before i give up  i thought i'd ask around a bit 
no  you're right   i had been seeing this behavior and thinking that ar assigned an id which wasn't happening with fg  they do both work the same  closing this as a non issue 
wow  i actually tested    forgery  internet   before  which didn't work   but    forgery  internet  worked now  thanks   
that's what i ended up going with  i was just trying to figure out if there was special syntax that handled those types of scenarios that i had misinterpreted missed  thanks 
thanks  i just used "bundle update"  what should i use instead of "factory"  i am so confused by docs for fg4 and old ones    
in a large project context setup is the most complicated part and it is always flipped no matter how you define it  in general  i feel like this feature gives additional flexibility to generate data with factorygirl  which is its main goal  i don't want factorygirl to decide how should i generate my context  it's my job  just want a flexible tool to do it  ### live examples  https   gist github com 5795005 https   gist github com 5795040 ### simplified version of live examples  that is too complex to show real code i am doing things from your code example about 3 times a day  in a team of 5 people it is 15 times a day average  let's take the following association chain 
 djcp i tried that  the error persists 
thanks
my goal in the above example is not to use the  foo  factory  just a bad example  i'll update the attribute name accordingly so it's less confusing
 promoderates good point  i'll change all  doe  references in the code to a similar string  would be great if we can look at getting this merged once i've done that

yeah  i think you're right that this is caused by #268  it seems like the issue i'm having with the color swapping only happens on page boundaries 
at  574 152   i e  just where it has been before the bounding_box   canvas 
maybe 'custom styles' isn't the right word  but in the pdfs we build  we use a mix of font weights  light  normal  and bold  
i keep getting this error message   so i have tried changing the font to a ttf font as adviced  did it  as i described in my initial message  but i still get the same error  i simply don't know where the problem is and how to solve it   
 pointlessone i have pushed a repo to replicate the error 
yes it works wmname   "qtile"   didn't work wmname   "lg3d"   works well also works if remove wmname package from system
doesn't replays
thanks  i'm researching an alternative approach using screenlets  i'll let you know if i still need this issue resolved once i have clarified my requirement 
i did some testing  and the sleep line did seem to make for a great work around  but just as i was writing this comment  the issue reoccurred  here's a screenshot    screenie  https   raw github com gist 3775670 b7b2bbd27ffbc5c87838b02b7b708f94b45f7206 textbox 20redraw 20error png

this worked thanks

 display  0 xrandr  with the abovementioned situation outputs   it appears the error i mentioned does nor occur in conjunction with the situation in question 
i can  and that is what i do for almost everything  but that requires a patched font instead of obeying  fontconfig  rules for some reason  i've still to find a patched font that doesn't  in one way or another  butcher the original  what i resort to now is a  textbox  widget for each icon  with a custom font that contains _only_ icons  and a standard font for the widget itself  the trouble is  i can't set icons for dynamic widgets this way  such as the battery charging indicator

we don't have emojis  unfortunately this will be a hard one to track down in the console  it seems related to rails autoloading and is sporadic  so probably depends on the order in which things run on a new process  will try to pin it down if we see another case

 jeremy is it related to this  https   github com mikel mail issues 1038
sure   i haven't encountered this in production  but i was working on a refactor of a notification system that would have been able to do some fancy tricks by passing  mail  message s around and then calling  deliver  in a centralized location  but given the common usage pattern in rails of invoking  deliver  directly on the mailer  it would have created this risk  so   abbreviated 
hi  ahorek  thank you for your response  some software is known to modify convert messages in a subtle way  e g by converting the transfer encoding to 7bit  quoted printable  or base64  or removing trailing spaces   it doesn't matter for many users because the meaning of the message is preserved  the message will be delivered  and will be readable  that said  when you're going to sign your message with open pgp  and probably some other tools as well   you got another problem  such alterations typically invalidate the signature  for this reason  both rfc 1847 "security multiparts"  and rfc 3156 "mime security with openpgp"  make restrictions on transfer encoding  they require that the signed message part is encoded either as quoted printable or base64  and has no trailing spaces  and this is the only reason why i want to force the transfer encoding of my choice  the problem is explained in detail in rfc 3156 section 3 "content transfer encoding restrictions"  and somewhat in rfc 1847 section 2 1 "definition of multipart signed"    https   tools ietf org html rfc1847   https   tools ietf org html rfc3156
ah yes  sorry i missed these since they were closed  i'll test the 2 7 1 rc1 gem  but looking at the patches from #1168 i am pretty sure it will solve my problem  thanks

hi   jeremy  thanks for the quick response  i just tried both 2 7 1 and 2 8 0 edge and the problem is still reproducible on both  if my reading of https   github com mikel mail pull 1062 is correct  it only added support for the utf 7 binary encoding and not the utf 7 quoted printable encoding 
an all_headers config setting would be sufficient for me  but the way the header_filter is implemented right now it would make sense to convert it into a setting itself 
i've tested today again  and it works  what's strange  i'm supposed that there would be a configuration issue related to serving media  although i haven't changed nothing 
not sure if you got my emails or not  i can't see them here   but anyway  this is the error message i get  template error in template  library python 2 6 site packages django_debug_toolbar 0 8 4 py2 6 egg debug_toolbar templates debug_toolbar base html  error at line 49 caught attributeerror while rendering  'template' object has no attribute 'origin' 39   div  40    for panel in panels    41    if panel has_content    42  div id "   panel dom_id   " class "panelcontent"  43  div class "djdebugpaneltitle"  44  a href "" class "djdebugclose"    trans "close"     a  45  h3    panel title safe     h3  46   div  47  div class "djdebugpanelcontent"  48  div class "scroll"  49    panel content safe    50   div  51   div  52   div  53    endif    54    endfor    55  div id "djdebugwindow" class "panelcontent"   div  56   div  57

 tim schilling thanks  i guess reading the documentation would have been a good idea  as a long time use of the beta version  i was expecting a drop in replacement  changing that setting fixed the problem  i still think this is a bug  if  debug_toolbar_patch_settings  defaults to  true   it should support core django features  like custom user models 
 aaugustin  it was caused by a  bug  https   github com etianen django reversion issues 241  in django reversion  sorry to bother you over it 
oops sorry  copy pasta'd version from django extensions  my app doesn't understand the   debug    routing on a sql explain  reinstalled from master  same issue 
i was reading the readthedocs org documentation  which claimed to be the latest version  i've since closed the tab  but i remember checking to see what version it was  and it said "v  latest" but didn't list any other available versions  when i go to the readthedocs org site now  i see that the latest docs have the new panel name  and the 0 11 0 docs have the old panel name  the webpage must have been showing the old docs but claiming they were the new ones  very strange 
it does fix the problem  thanks for the quick feedback 
if you ask so nicely    closing as superseded by my pr in #559 
i'm using chrome   chromium  latest  i'll test it out on other browsers and report my findings  thanks
sorry for the late response  i think the traceback is useless  but anyway here it is   i don't understand while it autoreloads just after starting  i didn't modify any code and it does it everytime when djdt is enabled  you can find  my custom user model here  https   github com 1flow 1flow blob feature django 1 6 oneflow base models py   and  the contents of my virtualenv here  https   gist github com karmak23 11305946

no  this is not a error  just warnning but it cause http 500  the last few lines like 
 xavierdutreilh you're right  my mistake  sorry
note that debug toolbar middleware recommends going first  but it works better if it's after whitenoise which should be first  ala   serving media files isn't slow  what was slow was all the profiling and stuff being run on all the static content requests  note from whitenoise project  i run my development using gunicorn and most of the static requests tend to be 304 responses  machine was getting bogged down trying to profile requests that weren't needed  it's actually usable now  not running ddt on prod

i would have if i was a bit more fluent with python packaging  very limited experience here sorry      as i mentionned  i don't even know if it's actually technically possible to do something like this  but anyway   the best fix amha would be to plain remove the requirement on django 1 7 and clearly document which django version is supported  i know the information is there   i found it browsing the tags on github and finally installed 1 3 2   but it's not obvious on readthedoc   that's what most django apps do fwiw  debug_toolbar is the first one i've met that tried to update my django install  my 2 cents   
which code did you use 
there is no error anywhere  as i said it all worked perfectly in django 1 10 4  it is even broken in my samsung tablet  the 'hide   ' tab does work  but none of the others function at all  this is my dev env settings

usually i spend a long time to ensure that every application's look'n'feel is as similar to others as possible  regardless of the used toolkit  so yes  for me the ui font setting is totally unnecessary  although it might be useful to retain the fontdiff setting   other users may of course feel differently     fontdiff  i remember reading about one person who had a similar problem with exactly the same fonts  but with a gtk based application  unfortunately i couldn't find the link now   so the actual problem may be deeper   
i do not have a     colarc  i have a     cola   i also don't have a     config git cola  
thanks  i think you can add a function  but i may don't use it  too  i now understand  
i don't think it's a dupe of #174   git cola  keeps the preferences for the session  i'm on ubuntu 12 10  running  git cola  1 4 3 5  i know it used to work  but it's never worked on this particular machine 
looks like it isn't and i was wrong  i'll have to check next time whether it's slow with a normal commit  in my mind  committing and amending are the same thing  so my memory about this is unreliable 
i am on 1 9 4  i will upgrade and re open this issue if the problem persists  meanwhile  thank you for your time 
hi  davvid  on the time of opening this issue   latest commit on master was 59e686e099abe0a3ff7da7e35e9bc8ca0d1b4b39  i can confirm  that build from this commit still reproduces described issue  however current latest commit from the master 4409089292cbdf86282c54a4b7e95d2d8e48f3fb doesn't have the defect anymore  so  we can close this issue  i think  anyway  to prevent such a case for new users in future   i would still put a step with  git checkout  on latest stable and tested version

the revert fixed it  the "success" list comes from calling table   on the query table  for some reason  we decided to make table   return a string instead of being void  i don't think fitnesse does anything with the result  so changing table   to not return anything also fixes the problem  however  i'm guessing a similar problem will occur if the query method returns list with an element that has    in it  see https   github com gshakhn fitnesse commit da9bf793bc1d4b01551e6f94ecacfb14f3e23835 for a test case 
i've updated the issue layout so you can more easily read it  if  like you said  it's the same  i'm fairly certain that it's the same problem  since i also used jdk 7 
not sure why you say hundreds of rows is fishy  we switched to slim few months ago but this issue is common in both  this is a very common use case  all of our tests had to be refactored to smaller tests  had been trying to resolve this since a year now  yahoo groups never responded 
one question regarding integration tests is how to manage the versions of dependencies  would we check master branches  latest maven versions  which java version to use  e g  we may move dbfit to java 8+ some day         it can be this way to kick it off quickly if it's acceptable for fitnesse  dbfit is just one of the fitnesse clients so a general solution perhaps may evolve into something more complicated  e g  separate project or sub project  
sorry i forgot to include that  but i'm using 20130531
just a lot of stuff  such as json serialized documents and ensuring that certain elements are in there via regexs

we have a lot of templates  some are generic global to the entire suite and some are scoped to specific suites  there are about 15 generic templates so far and can be another 15 20 specific to another suite  our goal is to have a template per fixture as documentation to qa of our available fixtures

thanks for your help and sorry for the delayed response on this  it looks like the issue was just in the weird version  not sure how that happened  a more recent one fixed the problem  if it's still of any interest  the memory usage would grow to a normal size at the start of the test and then spike right at the end  after the test was finished  memory usage would not decrease  running the test multiple times did not cause the memory to spike as dramatically at the end but did increase memory usage over time  again  the newer version of fitnesse fixed the issue so it's probably not an issue any more 
this happens in every single search i run  title or content based  whenever the search is complete  that seems to be the pattern   this does not occur when doing a properties based search  which i thought was kind of peculiar 
good to know but i haven't tried yet 
hello  i can say that it was working great with release 20140901  it was no longer working with version 20150114 
yes the error occurred in our tests and we are using java 1 6 sent from iphone  please ignore typing errors  best regards anis ben hamidene
jediwhale  thanks for your great idea  really  i started to localize test page which produced stackoverflow exception and i found it  the issue is that i have placed a reference for page1 on exactly this page1  e g  there is following page with path suite1 suite2 suite3 and in content txt file of this page there is following text   include  suite1 suite2 suite3
it's bombing at this point     any ideas from that 
i managed to get it working by changing the method name to   public boolean checkifsorted list  string   values    so  this is definitely looks like a method naming issue  i would like to know the rules and why   issorted   cannot be found by slim system 
 six42 for example  if im testing a list of apis using the restfixture  i'd like to pass a root urls using a properties file so that they're all in one place  i could define them all in the root but i'd prefer them outside of fitnesse files  currently  i've added them into  plugins properties  but was just wondering if there's a way to pass multiple properties files to fitnesse so that fitnesse plugins config and my properties are separated out 
yes  you are right  keetron   adding   define slim port  0   solves the issue 
 jeremycarlsten i put my jar as you said and i still have an error 
to ensure highly available sut and abstract the web server from running the test  it's not a big issue but is nice to have    i'm can think of some workaround to do it but i want to know first if fitnesse slim support it out of the box 
we are using our fixtures  included on classpath   so i suppose it will be translated to symbols  right now i increased heap to 8gb and looking what is happening there  for you request   i will try

aye sir  https   github com flori json issues 164
okay  so i went to recreate the problem and in an effort to remove as many variables as possible i tried things from the command line instead of from rubymine  which is my normal environment   the segmentation fault only happened when running it in rubymine  from the command line it became a normal  if surprising  lexing error  as it turns out  i had rubymine using 1 9 2 and my system default was 1 9 3  switching to 1 9 2 on my system yielded the expected segfault  i have not investigated 1 8 7 or 2 0 at this time  in both cases i am using gherkin 2 11 6 on a 64 bit windows 7 os  i did a search for that mkmf log file but the only one that turned up on my whole machine was for the ruby debug base19 gem  here is a gist of the files that i am using to cause the problem  https   gist github com enkessler 5233587
sure  i will send one later today 
sorry after hard time to dealing i found the core of this issue  i assumed that the two presence in the before hook means that the one should belong to the background part  conclusion was  that my support env rb has been loaded two times  therefore every hook has been executed twice  this should have been part of flow control in before after hooks  now it's clear  that background doesn't have before hook  however  regarding scenariooutline examplerow   i found in the web  that order of scenario types which should appear in before after hook should be following   before    1st scenariooutline   per every step   examplerow  after    x times   examplerow   1x scenariooutline am i correct 
i'll work on this asap
we're just using the default json formatter with a guard against people who monkeypatch time now with timecop  https   github com circleci cucumber formatter it looks like it would  but we would need a way to hook into it from outside of the test suite  similar to what we're doing with custom formatters 
i tried with 2 0 0 beta 3 and the result is still the same 
e g  a step like    i delete the      w+     project    and then this call will not be matched   step needs to be modified to this for such use case to work     i delete the    "  w+  "   project    but now i read https   github com cucumber cucumber wiki step argument transforms it looks like the transform step is matching individual matches instead of whole step string  i guess that this feature just can't work this way  maybe another transform hook is needed if whole step string is to be transformed 
 cucumber   version  gives 1 3 17  backed up by gemfile lock 
checked on "v1 3 19" and "v1 3 17"
i can parse the output to detect my specific problem  but it isn't generic solution  here is more info about exit statuses  http   www gnu org software libc manual html_node exit status html cucumber is very specific application  which should fail even if it actually works  so i don't know if it is possible to follow any standard convention  however status 0 is always success and every other is an error  so the simplest thing is to define at least 3 exit statuses  0   success  1   cucumber error  2   failing specs  but there might be some conventions i don't know  i'm curious what other people think about it 
 tooky thanks steve  good to know that  but i think it will be worth to clean up our step definitions  unfortunately not in the near future which was the reason for this issue 
hey   mattwynne  thanks for your reply as in the example above  we just want to have the printed message from a step can go with the step name printed by cucumber pretty formatter  otherwise  as you see above  the message printed from step1 " in step 1" is above the scenario line    kind of messy    any suggestions  thanks
thanks for getting back to me  here goes the gemfile   i am using refinerycms and am trying to upgrade to version 3  had no issues before the upgrade   but the upgrade has affected quite a few gems  i am getting no stack trace for deprecation warnings  please let me know how i can switch it on for cucumber 
 danascheider i'm on a really tight schedule right now  and would not be able to participate  thank you for offer  i understand  that it's possible to do that already  but have not checked 
 luke hill sorry i don't have a simple repro for this as i found it only when profiling some code on my side where i had extended from the existing json formatter and noticed that this method getting called a lot and spending time when there was no ned to calculate the length of the step like the pretty formatter requires  when i dug a bit more into it i noticed the typo and overrode on my side to increase quite a bit the performance of the json formatter

i did try that and i know what kind of problems does it solve however in these cases it didn't help it's strange because the exact same query works perfectly with database administration software but with pyodbc it only works after i start removing parts of the query  i kept on experimenting for hours and i couldn't reach any reasonable conclusion on what exactly is causing these errors other than the query being "complex"

 norman that make sense  my workaround is the same  i won't be able to tackle this anytime soon but agree with you on supporting any character type field as primary key   thumbsup 
i'm using 2 3 4  norman  i just checked that while in a console i could create my model as expected with a correct slug  although in the mentioned scenario  i was creating model entries from a rake task  as soon as i get back  i'll check if it has anything to do with the text encoding in rake tasks 
thanks for the quick response  i was finally able to reproduce the problem on a fresh app  it's related to devise  if you have both 'devise_for  user'  in the routes file  and ' user     history'  in the model  in the same app the error occurs  removing either of those gets rid of the problem  here's an app you can clone to reproduce the issue  https   github com sohara historytest you'll need to have an account with heroku and use the following command to make sure you create your instance using the cedar stack  heroku create   stack cedar let me know if there's anything i can do to help  i'm no whiz but i'm happy to keep looking 
yup  sure does 
my bad   workin now
yes  it's    slugs be unique only on a per user   how  please  me help  
yes  i want to be able to set the slug updating any single postcategory record 
in fact i don't have it  i won't be able to test if that fixes this until next tuesday  as soon as i can spend some minutes on it i'll tell you  but looking in the model table should create problems if there's more than one locale active  right  we have been using refinery a lot lately  and in some multilocale sites   that's why we get quite surprised but this bug  s however  we've been thinking and we never had more than one page or blog post in more than one locale with the same title  i'll look into it and try to post an spec test to chek if it fails  maybe it's just under very uncommon circunstances that the bug arises  thanks

yeah  it works with your updated repo  thank you for taking time to fix this minor issue  would you briefly explain  for someone who knows little about emacs  how you solve the issue  besides  you suggested  in https   github com purcell exec path from shell #setting up your shell startup files correctly  that "config files should therefore set the environment variables to their exact desired final values"  but  that can be out of some users' control  in my bash_profile  for example  there is "export path " users zhfu anaconda2 bin  path"  which is automated added by anaconda2 installer  apparently 
not quite  there are plenty of valid reasons to invoke a shell command  such as vagrant does  providing a convenient wrapper around virtualbox and other vm's  however  many uses of shelling out are entirely superfluous  such as using awk from ruby  or perl 
if you believe it's a bug  then i can try attacking it from that angle  i just wanted to make sure i wasn't doing something dumb 
yeah  sure  i traced down the piece of code that raise this error 
you did a great job  anyway  thanks  keep it up  i have more feedback  maybe i should contribute a little here as i can know 
it does look like the bundle locked on an old version  closing 
yes  it can work as a solution in this case  but should this kind of code raise  instance variable assumption  smell if it's clearly not what it is  but actually opposite  i'm not assuming that this instance variable exists  i'm checking if it is

 chneukirchen we're running a template rails app running on the torquebox stack  i don't think torquebox uses one of the included handlers  my understanding is that the handler is supposed to translate rack's headers hash into a string of newline separated key value pairs to send as response headers  obviously  this ticket can't be fixed with rack's hash data structure given that a hash cannot have duplicate keys  however  maybe i am misunderstanding the contract that rack makes with its handlers  are you saying that the handler  not rack  is responsible for translating

re examining the parser rb i now see that we scrub the filename  so this shouldn't be an issue  i was checking this on rack 1 5 2 which was different  the issue with 1 5 2 was that unescape would produce a invalid byte that was then fed into '  ' and 'split' methods which caused the invalid byte error  i guess it seems to be already resolved in master 
running the minimal version of the test suite works on master  i'll patiently await the next release  thanks    
i'm seeing th produces the error message  it's weird because i went looking at a older app i did with rack server pages and i was using just redirect   all over the app and it worked as expected   
yes i figured that out  and it's stated in the specs i pasted above  but i was particularly interested about the rack specs  i do have myself tons of custom middlewares that expect a hash and was just surprised to see that it's not defined in the specs 
 ioquatix can do  how do i know what went into 2 1 0  is it okay to move everything in “unreleased” to 2 1 0 
it also seems like it should work to me   rack  static 's constructor initializes a file server by passing the root path it receives to  rack  files   which in turn expands the path with  file expand_path  to get a full absolute path  could it be the rails web server  eg puma  applying some restrictions so that content outside of the rails app directory cannot be served 
good god no    the thing i did    total hack job was    this  i realized that if 2 0 8 works  i will use that  so i forked it  and make a branch for myself off of 2 0 8  i added in the samesite cookie and then re bundled my app to use that rack  my branch of 2 0 8  so now my app works as usual  and the chrome browser worked too with all the samesite none settings    i am going to be scared moving forward but for now it buys me a little time

how to pass request url to connection handler  i can't find this option in documentation  and google doesn't help either

ruby 1 9 3 mri finally i figured out a small example script    i am tracking the beginning and the end of  cleanupsockets  calls  "cleanup   " and "done  n" together with flushes  this        returns nothing but "cleanup   " for me  so the unbound connection somehow interrupts in a way i did not expect  this seems to be the reason for the described "concurrency" issue  because in nested calls  my unbind called  em attach   do i miss something 
turns out yes  i am using a girl_friday work queue to send data  wrapping with  next_tick  works nicely  i guess em just isn't thread safe

no  it run through on the 1 0 1 at least twice  4 errors  9 failures though  is there anything i can help with 
 ept  this bug still affects me  i'm using linux by the way  ubuntu 12 04 
we had some re factoring  which involved em  queue  getting back to business  ruby 2 0 0p576 _dev_  so the results are pretty same  reliable multiplication of consumed ram  i'd gladly provide more debugging info  if one is needed
i am using postgresql  ok thanks  sodabrew  i'll read that forum 
hello  thank for your answer  i've switched over to em epoll and set the em set_descriptor_table_size to 60 000 now  i also changed my code from the ruby http lib to em httprequest  that also caused some crashes  now it seems to work fine  i had no crashes anymore  the interplay between rabbitmq  bunny  and the websocket server works great  my test script created 5 000 connections without crash  to select    it seems it's not validated that the descriptor size is lower then the current connection size  maybe that would help to avoid the crashes or unpredictable behaviors  best regards  alexander
i didn't find a solution all what i did i uninstalled rbenv totally from my laptop and reinstalled it  bundler and ruby again  that worked 
yes i built both versions of the gem with openssl 1 0 2l
can i comment the line 118 
yes  but https    is not working  getting 'connection closed by server' response  but net  http working perfectly uri   uri url  http   net  http new uri host  uri port  req   net  http  post new uri path   'content type'   'application json'   http use_ssl   true http request req

no i'm not using shopify 
oh  sorry for that  i kept that in mind but forgot to set it here
it would be really convenient if the filter could take an optional language param to override  i assume   the accept language header coming from the browser  the use case being  we'd like to respect the browser on the main site  but also serve language specific subdomains  eg fr ourshop com  that always only serves the shop in french 
 fw42 honestly  it's not matter of the template or variables  even if i try example from readme   it's not working  no error thrown at all  also when using render without     errors property is not being populated 
hi  pushrax  here is the backtrace  
we had version 3 installed and now upgraded to version 4  now it runs fine  thank you very much 
it works  thanks  kainjow   
the decoding error does occur before the buffer overflow  i'm not sure how to switch between mp3 and aac the proxy software is a corporate installation  so it's not entirely clear what they installed  as i only have access to the proxy url to redirect traffic through  pianobar does not crash  it merely skips to the next song 
it's useful to access all of pandora's features strictly through the terminal for efficiency  pianobar seems incomplete without access to at least the important pandora radio features  i sent you an email by the way 
oh yes  yes it did  let me investigate my system 
yes  that patch fixed it  thanks 
hi  config is the one copied from github and i have this   the _echo  l_ is what i only added  i'm a beginner in bash so i'm not sure if it's the script can also be the problem  thanks 
not sure what happened  i thought i had git head at that point  i ran 'make clean' then 'make' and 'sudo make install' and it all worked just fine  i can't repeat that problem now

i removed the last post because it contained some private material  i can resend to you directly if you prefer   
nope  applying that patch did not do the trick what _did_ fix it was changing  however  that caused an architecture mismatch  c99 builds 32 bit binaries by default and i had installed libraries via brew  which probably uses the default architecture on my system  adding a " w 64" option to c99 to force it to build a 64 bit binary instead of a 32 bit one got it working  https   gist github com 883786
if i delete the control fifo at  home  user  config pianobar ctl and restart pianobar  the playback is continuous again  i'm going to ask jreese  the author of the script i'm using to control the fifo if he knows what's up  his github page  https   github com jreese pianobar python but i doubt it has anything to do with his script  because if i just run "touch  home    ctl" and run pianobar  i see this problem  did anything change in how you read the control fifo file

in the version of make i have  the    will override the environment variables which are set outside of that makefile  the openwrt cross compiling system depends on these to hand off the proper flags  in openwrt  they use a different compiler  or wrapper for the compiler  which is not c99 by default  so it needs the  std 99 flag  using wrappers for gcc is pretty standard from other cross compiling environments i have seen 
i don't think i'm behind a proxy  i don't have to configure anything proxy wise  as for audio format  i'm using whatever is default  i haven't configured anything special 
sorry  posted this in the wrong thread  will move to pianopub 
indeed  i shall work see whats up  however as said before if i play mixxx  or lmms while also running flash i can switch from the two  with pianobar i notice the inability to do this until pianobar is killed  on thu  nov 3  2011 at 1 06 pm  promyloph   reply reply github com wrote

#2  on pthread_clean_push   the man page indicates  "posix 1 permits pthread_cleanup_push   and pthread_cleanup_pop   to be implemented as macros that expand to text containing ' ' and ' '  respectively  for this reason  the caller must ensure that calls to these functions are paired within the same function  and at the same lexical nesting level   in other words  a clean up handler is only established during the execution of a specified section of code  " what you're proposing doesn't sound like it conforms to that  #3  the size specific ints  in this case uint8_t

sorry for the false alarm  it was indeed a network issue  k9 web protection program for parental control  the linux os was crunchbang in vm 
i applied that patch and it worked for me  thanks for the fast turn around on that  i might have patched it myself this weekend  but you're quicker 
i have both the proxy settings in pianobar set and http_proxy variables set 
look at the network traffic  when i pause a song downloading stops  unpausing does not cause it to resume  when i skip a song  next  downloading continues but there is no output and pianobar shows that the current time in the song isn't moving 
i recently installed pulseaudio so maybe it's using that  i don't have '   libao'  what do you recommend i try for default_driver

sorry  i forgot to explain that  after a long time listening i got the following message from pianobar  when i try to log in via web browser the pandora website return the following message  if i log in with another account it works normally  so  i assume they blocked my account 
i'd say in response to this  yea however  you bring up a good point with  in that case i'm inclined to agree  too bad    it would be great to have things like  songplay    songpause   and  durationremaining   etc   but it's not worth it in that case  thanks though  i still love  pianobar  as is    
so i looked at that earlier but i have no other problems with my connection at all  i did extensive testing to see if anything was wrong with it  this is on a raspberry pi and i have turned off ipv6 because that won't affect anything in my internal network  but i did that probably over a year ago and i've been using pianobar on it for a very long time without issue  no settings changed  this just started happening out of the blue  i was curious if others have been seeing it recently as well since my setup hasn't changed at all but pandora has been a bit weird for me lately  i'm also not getting the "trying next address" error  i'm getting the "connection timed out"  my connection to everything else is fine so i'm not sure what's happening here  i was hoping others might be experiencing it 
i'm using whatever version of pianobar is in the ubuntu 15 04 repos  i'm not sure how to check the version  i didn't have ffmpeg installed  i just rebuilt my machine recently  but this issue was happening back before my rebuild as well and i did have ffmpeg installed then   i have installed ffmpeg now to what is current in the ubuntu repos  ffmpeg  7 2 5 7 0ubuntu0 15 04 1 
it's definitely a bizarre issue  since i hadn't changed anything about my pianobar usage for a while i suspected it might be a server side thing  i can reproduce it for the 4 that i lost yesterday     "frankey   sandrino"     "french traditional radio"     "rjd2"     "wax taylor"  i can re add all of those when i start up pianobar and listen to music from them  but when i close and re open the application i get another  and the station is missing  i also lost a    "yoshida brothers"  station today while attempting to reproduce it 
oh  i forgot you have to have quickmix station selected before that  it would be a good idea to add that to the note  for example "not a quickmix station  please make sure quickmix station is selected " or something  thanks for the answer  works now

thanks for the suggestion  3 4 fails to build  missing linux perf_event h header file  but 4 1 built ok  this has allowed me to build the latest version of pianobar successfully 
don't worry  it's just an estimation given by company  i'll do test usage so the real life stats will be available  then i could do better proposals and or patches  thanks 
great news ari  i think we can keep the closed milestones on the calendar for reference  and maybe is easier to program  not sure   on a project should not be too many milestones on one month and we can already filter the project  can´t we  thanks 
well in our company  about 18000 employees  we have project management software  but they are all either too advanced and cumbersome to use or too simple aka  the confluence tasks  the problem with being too advanced means that everyone hates to use the software and neglects to bill correct times to the plan  the problem with too simple is that it is impossible to do any time tracking and project billing  thats where i think jobsworth could have an real advantage  niche  by being simple to use for regular users  but also more advanced for the hardcore planners  keep in mind that people hate to do stuff they shouldn't need to with the right software

yes the application yml exists in the location  var lib tomcat7 webapps root web inf config the previous issues was due to the context xml is not configured  i have properly configred now  and this error is solved  now i receive the following error  i already have the context xml filled in  etc tomcat7 context xml  b configuration   b   code   resource name "jdbc jobsworth" removeabandoned "true" auth "container" type "javax sql datasource" maxactive "100" maxidle "30" maxwait "10000" username "root" password "password" driverclassname "com mysql jdbc driver" batchsize " 1" url "jdbc mysql   127 0 0 1 3306 jobsworthdb autoreconnect true amp zerodatetimebehavior converttonull amp useunicode true amp characterencoding utf8" validationquery "select 1"     code   b  error   b  initialization failed org jruby rack rackinitializationexception  jdbc adapter requires  driver and  url  got  driver   mysql  from  var lib tomcat7 webapps root web inf gems gems activerecord jdbc adapter 1 3 16 lib arjdbc jdbc connection rb 89 in  setup_jdbc_factory' can you help me with this issue 
sure  here's an example  code 
 pdeschen are you sure  from what i can find  there are 2 johns    john fraser   showdown js   attacklabs net   john gruber   markdown  perl    http   daringfireball net projects markdown  am i mistaken  if so  who's the original author of showdown js anyway  
yes that was issue with something else   closing
for the test cases   test case 1     foo   bar   baz 1  foo 2  bar 3  baz transformation result 1    foo   bar   baz   foo   bar   baz test case 2   1  foo 2  bar 3  baz   foo   bar   baz transformation result 2   1  foo 2  bar 3  baz 4  foo 5  bar 6  baz it seems like that showdown will transform to ordered   unordered list according to the first list element type  otherwise caused by definition of markdown syntax   i couldn't put these 2 kinds of etiquette  star number  in the same list   thx a lot 
it's my spelling mistake  sorry 
i'm using showdown 05 08 2017  but i think that the js engine of sap  in abap environment  is old and i do not know where to get which version sap is using  thank you 
yes  china  i don't know why they do that  
yes  you are right  it happens only with  literalmidwordsunderscore  activated

i have a markdown file in the folder pages   see the index html file  inside there is a sidebar    capturar  https   user images githubusercontent com 40728648 56469715 9d6f8b00 6413 11e9 80ba 3e8710083bba png  when the user clicks on an item in there  the main page  white part  will load a markdown file and display it on the main page    capturar2  https   user images githubusercontent com 40728648 56469743 efb0ac00 6413 11e9 8226 70bedb2e3834 png  i want to know how to use javascript to load the markdown files into the "page" folder and use the showdown to parse it 
it looks to me  like the problem is that the parse method expects params in the form of a normal get request from the url seperated by " "  key1 value1 key2 value2        instead it should expect a normal hash params from rails  or is it me that misunderstood something  the params hash i received from quickpay and tried to send through  activemerchant  billing  integration  quickpay  notification  new params   was  "msgtype"  "authorize"  "ordernumber"  "0133"  "amount"  "2500"  "currency"  "dkk"  "time"  "120320225554"  "state"  "1"  "qpstat"  "000"  "qpstatmsg"  "ok"  "chstat"  "000"  "chstatmsg"  "ok"  "merchant"  " company "  "merchantemail"  " email "  "transaction"  " transaction_id "  "cardtype"  "dankort"  "cardnumber"  "xxxxxxxxxxxx8050"  "md5check"  " md5_checksum "  "controller"  "checkout"  "action"  "callback" 
that's the thing  i don't see the mr in the response  it only gets assigned in the code  but not returned  please correct me if i am wrong here  https   github com shopify active_merchant blob master lib active_merchant billing gateways paystation rb in line 102  it gets assigned  in line 163  the mr is part of the pstn_prefix_params hash  but during the ssl_post  or the paystationresponse call  line 166  170 respectively  it disappears  this led me to assume that it's not being returned   we checked this out using binding pry

sorry my problem i assign t column  id so there is no primary key constraint
sadly  all i see is   alter table "invoices" rename column "purchase_price" to "invoice_total"   which seems legit  looking further  the migration did the right thing in the database  so it seems the issue is in writing back to  schema rb   hth

looks like it's an ar issue  thanks for investigating  https   github com rails rails issues 22723
 yahonda i have check release17 which contains same bug  release18 master seem to be ok  i will submit a patch for release18 if this looks good 
ok  i will thanx   oooophh    i dont like google groups because of ugly interface and i dont understand why this feature is absent on github 
this is not really the point  once everything is indexed  the incremental index takes care of indexing  the real issue is when one wants to add another field to index  or changes the data  or any action that would require a full reindexing of the data  this does happen  whether we like it or not   the problem is that architecture of sunspot requires indexing through the rails  or ruby   which is slow  indexing millions of records can take days  at several hundred records per second   where as solr on its own can index at 10's of thousands of records per second  while sunspot is a very nice concept  i am not sure this is appropriate for large amounts of data   
thanks for the response  i am indeed using transactional fixtures however having that callback in my factory doesn't seem to work for me  the callback is working  it's the   index   method that i'm not having success with it  i tried calling it directly in my tests for my factories  and also had no luck with that  any ideas

after doing some test  i found out the condition that categories will disappeared  when the yaml front matter ends with       instead of         i made a mistake when i said i tested this  i thought i have  but either there's some other problem or i wasn't paying attention   the interesting thing is  even if the yaml front matter ends with        the categories page  http   0 0 0 0 5001 _categories  will then be empty  but at the end of the page those categories are there  if you need  i opened a testing repository in  ickc gitit test categories  https   github com ickc gitit test categories   the instance that categories has broken is when i did the last commit   changed yaml ending to        you can see from these 2 pages  1  http   0 0 0 0 5001 _categories 2  http   0 0 0 0 5001 test categories the former has nothing  the later has categories in the end   i attached my conf here  https   github com jgm gitit files 229038 default conf zip   where the only thing changed is the location of the wikidata

unfortunately  i'm not that strong in either ruby or rails  and i don't have the time at the moment to dig through the test suit and figure out all of the appropriate idioms  i pretty much only discovered this bug because redmine is affected by it  i'm more of a savvy consumer than a legit developer in that regard  that said  if i can dedicate myself to the task in the near future  i'll take a crack at it

i'm really sorry ken  for now i'm just a blind kitten in ruby and rails     i'd love to  but googling tutorails isn't a quick way to mastering ruby    probably i'll try 
activescaffold  a 3rd party framework i am using is marshalling a largish ruby object in the session  i agree that this is dangerous  it works under mysql  which is what leads me to believe to that there is something that the adapter is doing that it shouldn't  but at the same time  it is dangerous to begin with  i am going to switch off of activescaffold instead of worry about this 
getting started on that now  i'm not sure if i should just use quote_table_name in with_identity_insert_enabled    or search for the problem elsewhere 
doesn't seem to be working for me without a  freetds conf  file  removing the  dataserver  configuration entry gives an error   was hoping this could work without only the  database yml  file  but not there yet 
unfortunately i think this issue is localized    i'm thinking the index was screwed up  i re synced the environment and it went away  i think something was whacky with a last sync i performed from prod data to dev data and when i did that it was screwy  hoping this issue stays away     sorry again 
i'm getting clarification on the problem  i think it might be on my end  will close if its my fault

sorry  figure this out  i removed the attr_writer in the model  it causes trouble  i do not know why this is causing trouble  maybe rails 4 changes how it acts

happy to help  it's better  but not quite there  everything seems to say that this attribute is now _datetimeoffset_  which is great  it even will keep from changing the timezone automatically on assignment  but something is happening when i actually save the object   prior to the current change  the timezone would get casted on assignment  just to check  i also tried using the  skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes  method  to see if that hook is appropriate  but the behavior was the same  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord timestamp html

i have one common callback for all models  i have tried to resolve the issue by disabling that callback but no luck  many of the models have no callback but issue is arising in those model's create update operation also 
appreciate your help even though it doesn't appear to be this gem  freetds was installed via homebrew  i've never encountered this before using freetds and this gem  i have an identical application with the exact same models  but using postgres as the database and this error doesn't happen  so i naturally thought it was due to the change to sqlserver 
just sent it to the mailing list  according to the prophecy   pre  setmathfont asana math otf   pre  did not work 
debian squeeze is using tl2009  maybe with some minor changes  in tl2010 i do not have the problem either and i think i am going to use it from now  however i had to install the i386 version to avoid  issue 96  http   github com wspr unicode math issues 96    just in case it turns the issue to be easily fixable   big   bigg  etc  are ignored as well 
i did  you find it at  http   gist github com 609545 meanwhile i realized that the problem is not directly related to unicode math  loading fontspec instead of unicode math creates the same problem  in fact i found that it is enough to load the eu1 fontencoding  this points to a bug in xetex 
it works perfect with the nightly build  thank you 
sorry  i forgot to add  usepackage lualatex math   btw  i'm afraid that with your patch  lualatex embeds the font twice  xelatex embeds it only once

i cant always prevent that some objects contain functions  should i copy and preprocess every object before i pass it to object toquerystring    
tim  thank you for explaining that  i think there's still an issue  though  my code above was awful  haha  so i wrote a more robust example here that you can copy paste into a  xhtml  i used the function      idea that you expressed in your last code example and still no dice   so if you click "feed the cow"  and the "ask the cow " he will still say he's not satisfied  when he should say he is  right

 swhiteman thanks for the prompt replay 👍 i don't get the whole picture myself  but the general idea is  i have a huge model that contains a time out function that handles updating items  so it will make the  xmlhttprequest  then updates the items 
i actually wish it didn't return to the default file when i save it   
typo 6 0 9 rails 3 0 10 rvm 1 8 5 ruby 1 9 2 i tried that commit and i got the same behavior  the fix for me was to replace app views articles _protected_article_content html erb with this line  playing around with the settings field in the contents table  setting it to 1  would fix it for the view but broke it for editing  changing that view file above fixed it for both editing and viewing

as i understand the spec  headers only start on blank new lines  in this case i'm interpreting that to be outside of lists  should they start inside lists as well  in the metaexample it's shown that gfm doesn't consider ul to be an area where markdown h1 would be rendered 
version 1 3 1 i tried your example in my terminal and i got the same result  however  when i build my site with jekyll  or when github does it   the output is still as described above      hmmm     i wanted to show you my markdown file  so i just made a gist  and it is displaying correctly     gist of the markdown in question  https   gist github com jeremy edward bauerle 2118b79c63e86afeae8b#file 2014 07 03 the first post md   but it's still not display correctly in the post itself    here  http   jeremy edward bauerle github io blog the first post    are gists still using maruku   i'm going to toy around with various parser to ensure that's the problem  
 gettalong it's not minimal  but close to  it's actually supposed to render some bootstrappy thing  https   gist github com morandat 64031638f916b2e0a1c6
agree  yet i am trying to reproduce the way github processes markdown for jekyll  we have documentation with a header   and the id on github is  propertysubpropertyvalue   to maintain correctness of anchor tags on both the html and github markdown  i was hoping to be able to select which spans to include or not include    or just have default behavior in this case be that like github 
ok  it isn't a wrong output it is more like a general problem of how kramdown treats    and doesn't recognize    sometimes you want math to be inline  like so    text   inline math here   other text   that's how stock mathjax works and produce effect like so    example  https   i gyazo com 38f538b23a0eaf05926ae515f7c6733a png  and sometimes you want display math bahaviour  in stock mathjax you would do    some text    display math    some text   and will receive this effect    example  https   i gyazo com b66760f3acc3c992e37af3abbab538f6 png  but becuase of kramdown only understands    and treat it as inline math all my math becomes inline  i know  of course  that you can wrap something in html block and tell kramdown to skip it during parsing  but it seems dirty and comlicated  is there a way to make kramdown differ   and    
i want to quote backtick  code     code    i'm using kramdown on jekyll  sorry for being late  #### input  #### expected output gfm   code     code  #### actual output kramdown with gfm input option   code      code 
you are right  when i view the actual source  it is nested  but it appears that safari un nests it in the inspect element box 
it certainly would 
it happens after clicking install  second screen after entering shop url   openssl 0 9 8r 8 feb 2011
i cleared the browser cache and cookies  tried in ff  chrome  and safari  all reproduce the same issue  i'm running  6 0 4  on a fresh rails build using the generators 
quick question   any setting i can update so that when i refresh the browser i don't have to sign in again  seems like i'm killing the session somehow   ok  back to the issue  yes  but if you look at the gem page here  https   github com shopify shopify_app and then go down to this section  shopifyapp  sessionrepository it still has this   class shop   activerecord  base def self store session  shop   self new domain  session url  token  session token  shop save  shop id end def self retrieve id  if shop   self where id  id  first shopifyapi  session new shop domain  shop token  end end end
i did run it and it is what i have at config initializers shopify_session_repository rb
  create an app with certain scopes and install it to a store   change scope of the app and deploy   go back to store to login and you are not redirected to authorization screen to give permission to new scopes
yes  i did corrected the scope but still same issue  i havent tried locally because the redirect will have issues so i push to heroku and install from there  the app installed but redirected with that message  the app wont open from the store either 
i've just checked the webhooks in store admin  goto  storeurl  admin settings notifications under webhooks seciton    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 15209029 30283747 32b58c4c 9719 11e7 9c34 9e39a1cf21ef png 
the app is embedded within shopify admin  just click apps on the shopify admin and delete uninstall the app  sorry  i should have been clearer in documenting it  will make more effort to make it clearer next time  regards  eng guan yeo on wed  13 dec 2017 at 5 40 am kevin hughes   kevin hughes   kevin hughes  notifications github com      wrote 
wow  yes it's working by upgrading  activeresource  with version  activeresource     5 0 0    thanks 
actually  i determined that it works fine if you disable the embedded app functionality 
yikes it was on a fairly large project that i haven't looked at in quite a while  it was running 2 3 4  i resolved the problem by using the btelles faker fork if that helps 
it does fix the problem  though i'm wondering why this gem has to be added  because it's already in rails 
i am not using faker in a rails app   it is a simple ruby script   is enough to reproduce the problem 
yeah thats the main reason i asked  i didn't know if there were ai gems that reverse engineered nlp concepts to construct sentences based upon provided syntax points  for example  you could provide the verb  sentence   faker  conversation sentence verb  "run"     "i went for a run today" faker  conversation reply context  sentence     "really  i went for a run yesterday " if it does not exist  it could be an interesting project  but i'm trying to think if there are other potential applications to make it worth the effort  i think it probably goes outside the scope of faker  my initial thought is that it will be easier to just construct these manually for now 
it's in the project folder  so   sites project lib locales en gb yml
perhaps writing a script to find all end points in the yml located here  https   github com stympy faker blob master lib locales en yml and calling   length  on each element to get the length of each end array could be an option 
 faker  date between 1 month ago  time now  no_weekends  will not give you a date that is saturday or sunday one month ago for example or  faker  date between 1 month ago  time now  weekdays  will only give you dates that are mondays to fridays
 vbrazo  sushant12 this problem caused in faker 1 9 3  i solved this problem by upgrading gem version
it is not loading  yml files from faker's lib locale i had the same problem with english  and i'm using redmine  eventually what worked for me  is having stuff from en folder appended to en yml file in redmine's  config locale en yml and removing en  and leaving only one faker  then nesting other translations below it  then it worked properly    but the conclusion is it's not loading  yml files from it's folder  if app already has i18n done  the way redmine 4 has it   
i would love to do that  but i'm not very good with the build system  i'll look into it to see if it is something i can attempt 
happens in at least chrome  15 0 874 106  and firefox  6 0 2  
here's the result    as problem  http   902west com network png  and the contents of the admin js is 
i'm using ruby 1 9 2p290 with rails 3 1 2 i was using vhochstein branch  through rails 3 0  then when i tried to update to 3 1 i could not get either the primary branch or vhochstein branch to work with my code  when i make this change  my active scaffolds seem to be working  but not when i use them as embedded scaffolds   these fail silently when requesting ajax it would seem  seems like quite a few things are broken actually   i could not find an upgrade guide or anything  but seems like quite a few changes required since i updated ails versions and gems 
i am using the gem    active_scaffold  3 1 10  this is the indicator next to the close link before i close    img alt "loading indicator" class "loading indicator" id "as_forums_1_topics_1_posts create 1 loading indicator" src " assets indicator gif" style "visibility hidden "   when i click close i get this nested div 
i'm using the latest version  the below line is used for embedded  installation column shows up      render  active_scaffold    'digital_inputs'   constraints      installation_id     installation id     
apologies  i dropped the ball with other work taking over  it's fixed for me in 3 2 12  thanks sergio   from a fellow spaniard  very far from home

just booting the server and signing in  i fixed it in the preference model by putting in  attr_accessible   but then it came up in the next model to be initialized  so i just disabled the option in  application rb   this was with rails 3 2 8  in particular  the first error happened on line 127 of the user model when trying to initialize a new preference 
that is correct   only an issue if you try to 'select contact' for a contact that already has an account  i'd also find multiple accounts per contact useful  however it would need to be clear in the ui when i am adding another account to a contact as opposed to moving a contact to another account

this is vanilla fat free crm  downloaded as the zipfile  i haven't changed anything except for the ruby version  i also  as i understand it  cannot create directories and install anything other than the gems and plugins that are part of the application setup  i doubt i can correct the path on heroku  i assume unicorn is installed as a gem on ffcrm  i didn't get any time today to look at this  i think the best thing at this stage may be to delete the application and start again 
fresh install of ffcrm  created a personal list  saved it    and boom  it seems to do the save  because the list entry shows up  but clicking on it any time will hit the error 
i semmons  just installed edge money   money new 1212 45 to_d 100  to_s    "1212 45" seems to work fine  thank you for response 
1 9 3 and money gem 4 0 1 sweet  sounds like an upgrade will fix it  should have thought to check that first  thanks semmons99 
i don't understand your second question  yet    my need is  inherited and overridable amounts  i need a nil amount to state that this entry doesn't override the default value provided by a parent  schedule  record  i deal with recurring amounts   when the amount is nil  the app will retrieve the default amount via the parent record instead  is the code i provided good enough to achieve that or are there any know caveats

hi   thanks for the help   money infinite_precision    was   working  i was just using money rails which used an integer to back the value and was therefore losing precision  i ended up defining a custom currency with more significant digits and it's working well 
oops  i just noticed the last example of the  currency exchange  https   github com rubymoney money#currency exchange  block   seems like   it's already possible   to do what i was asking for  it didn't work for me last time i tried  maybe it was just something wrong with my code  i'll check again and re open if i find a bug   semmons99 i was talking about actually converting but behind the scenes by checking the exchange rate on the default bank  which seems like it's already been implemented 
i totally hear you on that  and i can provide some help in doing so  also  there's another unmentioned option  which is to pull in the code into money itself  since there's already some data redundancy between the two in terms of symbols and currencies 
for some reason  the same money euro 12345678  format returns something like this  pry main   money new 123456789  "eur"  format    "€1 234 567 89" i guess maybe because my default locale is "en_us"  in that case  because there are many other things in my repo that depend on the default locale  so i have to pass in the separator and mark explicitly 
yeah  unfortunately  #max  and  #min  are implemented in c code  here's  #max  for instance   from  https   github com ruby ruby blob 9b94249f39bff401465340639bed1f2a93b62ebf enum c i'm not familiar enough with ruby's c code to really grasp what's going wrong  i do know this code is ultimately calling  money#     though  and that this method is working as expected  i agree it's no biggy  just to ensure the array is all  money  objects before hand  that's how i'm working around it   it's just that this really caught me off guard because all the other comparison methods             etc   work fine with a mixture of  money  objects and plain numbers  the fact that  #max  and  #min  _don't_ work as expected  definitely breaks the   "rule of least surprise"    which probably isn't a good thing when working with financial transactions 
nope  i think it's settled

for our project we're hoping to let customers make up their own currencies on the fly  kind of like virtual currencies   calling  register  is possible but it would mean extra database queries at the top of each request to determine which currencies to register  each of our customers would have different currencies and will be hundreds across the platform  regarding 2  i did notice some issues when i registered currencies without  subunit_to_unit  so i'm guessing i'd need to find a way to set defaults for un registered currencies  monkey patching may be our best option  unless you're aware of any other way we could accomplish this 
hey  printercu  as said  we already have these  money   money zero  lines in our code base  as      0  wasn't possible at the time we put them in  and i wanted to avoid having to change them  and it was kind of unexpected change in behaviour for        so i thought maybe others might suffer from this as well  admittedly    negative   reads way better and seems to have been in existence for ages  so might end up just changing it to this instead     thank you

thanks for the quick response  since the operator of the admin page will be a non english speaker  it is desirable to have the menus in there language  and because the language is a 2byte character one  it is not possible to have model and action names changed to fit them 
i am sorry for my late reply  i used the mysql gem and ruby 1 9 2 on windows  but if i change to ubuntu with ruby 1 9 2 and mysql2 gem everthing works  could there be a problem with windows  ruby and mysql version 
here is the configuration city  fields  default  name  priority  active form  name  priority  active order_by   priority  name relationships  filters  name search  name application  dealzza thanks 
yes  i tried with a datetime format  thinking it was trying to perhaps format using the string  but same result 
well  that small exercise you asked made me get to the solution  i progressively created a small application with the same configurations i have  in my application i was using other default language instead of the default  "pt"  but the standard for portuguese for portugal is "pt pt"  i have adminuser's in my administration  since they have a locale preference  and that was set to portugal portuguese  "pt pt"  the application couldn't resolve the correct yml locale file  so  i corrected my default locale to "pt pt" and all thinks work again  ## although this is not a bug  i think the documentation should be more complete and detailed  it was a mistake to not use a standard i18n language type  if the user doesn't follow the standard  all things will work in the rails application  but if we had typus  with his default locales  some problems will occur  keep the good work 
there are arguments to be made on both sides but overall i think i prefer to keep everything in one place  having said that i suppose an argument can be made that permissions should go in the controller too 
rails 3 1 1  typus 3 1 5  everything works if i add integer_filter helper from there  https   github com fesplugas typus pull 303
for example  if page needs to include separate css and js and topbar submenu 
i guess that would be sufficient  however i would prefer it be per application  config is global  right    although not needed in my case  someone else might wish to run multiple servers on different ports 
web py and mod_wsgi with apache on webfaction 
ah  by accident  was looking at another issue  sorry 
i will doublecheck tomorrow  up to nowitzki just wanted to make it work  and to be honest there is still an exception missing for the second operation to get a bullet proof bugfix  i will work on it soon  am 30 01 2012 um 16 45 schrieb aaronswreply reply github com 
the key would be the url regex  value would the class to handle the request 
i think you may well be right unless it was generalised so that other authentication schemes could be used as well as aws keys  so a webpy rds project is feasible forking the db  s on 14 aug 2016 19 15  "anand chitipothu" notifications github com wrote 
it was my problem  not webpy's  i didn't change the appropriate term in my html code from 'input' to 'textarea ' if there is a way to delete this whole issue request  we probably should do so 
i'm sorry  but i have since then moved away from web py to flask  unfortunately   what i do remember is that the core issue seems to be that web py uses a slurped wsgiserver from cherrypy and the issues were in there  in cherrypy they've turned that server into a standalone project  cheroot  https   github com cherrypy cheroot  so also switching web py to that should probably fix the issue  i think i remember seeing a note from the cherrypy people that they separated out the wsgiserver specifically because various projects were using it without using the rest of cherrypy  like web py  
i think this may have been an issue in what i wrote  i am closing for now but if it occurs again  i will re open  thanks for your help 
the first two errors reported are indeed generated in that way  the last one is triggered when raising an exception inside any render function when running a frontend application
assuming that your are using the development server that comes with web py and the access log is being printed  is that correct  yes  exactly  that and fix if required  http   webpy org cookbook logging i don’t say it’s wrong  maybe i miss something  generally speaking i found such solution in a few articles on reddit and generally speaking it seemed that following the cookbook is a right way to turn off the logging  or at least printing it  
yes  just noticed it's already raised by other guy before  and i found the solution there  thanks
i install via the terminal pip install web py  0 51
let me put it another way  if you think of base_uri like this       then you can see why i would expect changes to base to immediately show up in a subclass  unless they have been overridden  
sorry for the confusion  i'll pursue crack    the gem   
  gem  v 1 3 6 i'm using rvm  but i'm not sure that should affect anything 
thanks for the explanation as to why it's case sensitive  ezkl  i'm going to close this issue  hopefully it helps some one else having a dumb moment    
let me know if i can help in any other way  i was thinking of attacking it but am not really sure where to even start 
i'm testing against this server 
hi  clone the repo and run  bundle exec rspec spec  on my computer 
you're correct  it's related to the redirect  if i use   it won't return any content  just the headers  i guess that even with a redirect it should only return the headers  no  i can try to work on a pr if this is a bug and not the intended behavior 
eh i did a bit more digging and i going to re generated the ssl certs and that seemed to fix it  sorry for the confusion 
this is the method that i am doing   then i am storing the returned value into a variable  do you need something else 
 rsullivan00 that does the trick  thank you both 👍
btw  with 0 15 on windows  the issue still there  but i hadn't that issue on gnu linux systems   
i am using version 0 15  which i believe is the most recent one  and the problem still persists 
i did not use your overlay at all  i'll double check the gst plugins  just in case  and i'll give a try to your overlay  i'll also try with qt 5 9  but if demo works with 5 6 2     but i'd like to keep 5 6 2 as it's the official  i mean  for gentoo  stable one for now

it happens with parts named 'body' or named something else  after further digging  the key difference between your test case and mine is that in yours  the repetition happens in the global context  in mine  it happens one level down  inside of a named part  what's happening in the case i described    the layout wants to render the body part  the global context has no rendered parts list  so it starts one and adds 'body'    the body part wants to render the extended part  it inherits the rendered parts list from the layout context  and adds 'extended'    the body part wants to render the extended part again  it inherits the rendered parts list from the layout context  and 'extended' is already there  so it falsely detects recursion  in the test case you linked to    the global context renders an unnamed string  and so never creates a rendered parts list    the unnamed string wants to render the body part  and has no rendered parts list  so it starts one and adds 'body'    the unnamed string wants to render the body part again  and still has no rendered parts list  the previously created one was thrown away with the first body part's context   so it starts one and adds 'body'  i may not be getting all the terminology right  but the point is  the rendering parts stack isn't strictly local  and so it doesn't automatically get popped when the tag locals stack is  my previous fix gets the job done  but here's one that  a  uses tag globals  since you're sharing the data structure once you get into part rendering anyway  and  b  integrates better with your existing test case 
yes  in standard_tags rb  in tag 'date' do  tag  change time now to time zone now

unfortunately that escapes the whole link not just the title so you get   pre  code  lt a href  quot  health safety  quot  gt health  amp  safety lt  a gt   code   pre  instead of   pre  code  a href " health safety " health  amp  safety  a   code   pre  markdown has kinda ruined that example but hopefully you see what i mean
its a bug in remove  i want to say not to load sheets at the moment  so if i have a  all in config extensions it should still not load extensions in config extensions      
sorry  i didn't know that language pack has it own repository  i'm fix this issue and fork as you proposed 
sorry  i'd just been working around this issue  let me give it a shot today and see if i can finish my example 
oh sorry  it's markdown  no extensions 
that is not the issue  it is ruby 1 9 2  the ruby 1 9 1 you see in the stack trace there is a well known ruby bug that outputs the wrong version  nothing to worry about there 
i did run  bundle update   otherwise it wouldn't be loading it at all   i haven't checked    script server  yet  
thanks  jomz for the reply   avonderluft helped me to fix the problem  there was an index html file in public folder  that caused the request not reach the application 
with rails 3 0 0 beta3  on ruby 1 9 2dev  2010 05 24 revision 27991  
i stand corrected  thank you  still  if there isn't an issue with doing a local 'tmp'  or 'tmp' plus random number to prevent collisions   it would be easier to write cross platform code  rather than having to detect the system and then use different environment variables depending on platform 
i feel like something like that is more appropriate in the method_option line since that's where the arg is getting passed in  i want to manipulate it  bam  done  it's not a show stopper by any means  just nice to have 
hi maxmeyer  we had noticed that  but our heuristic consider all the development history 
because that's what the  options  hash is constructed from  when i want to extract values from it  with  #slice   and pass it into my own libraries that provide their own default options  with  #reverse_merge     it gets corrupted 
no  in my specific scenario i only want to track progress on certain type of requests added to the queue  and don't want other request interfering reporting progress  i have query requests and upload request—only progress of upload requests matter  like i said  it's possible to workaround this by also setting  showaccurateprogress yes  without delegates on the asinetworkqueue  the problem is that it relies on the value set on delegates of the queue and the requests to receive the accurate progress on the right place  i could also use a separe queue… anyway  provided there are no side effects  this improvement suggestion comes in the light of the least astonishment principle for the programmer  up to you to close the issue or let me know if you want a pull request from me  thanks 
since rake is additional dependency and it typically brings in others  in mocha's case bundler  yard  there used to be rcov as well

hi  nitishr  and thank you for the ideas  i won't pretend to understand why you think the new behavior is more correct  this goes way above my head    but my use case is this  multiple calls  in a potentially unpredictable sequence  to a method that both yields and returns  and that needs stubbing  1  on changing application code  changing application code is unfortunately not an option  and anyway  it is very bad practice to modify production code in order to satisfy the idiosyncrasies of testing  i am  however  totally open to changing the test code  2  but changing the test code is not practical either  the problem with the test code change is that it requires knowing the exact number  type  with or without block   and order of all invocations  that is easy to do in this simplistic example  but my actual broken test is a high level integration test  the method is called many times during the test  so hardcoding that exact sequence of invocations as stubs would be quite tedious  worse  it would also be a terrible practice  as it means totally coupling a feature test to the exact implementation  making the test extremely brittle since any refactoring would likely break it  and i am not even sure it is technically possible to hardcode the sequence of invocations  test randomness may cause the exact sequence to change from one test run to the next  i am open to other ideas  but so far  by the looks of things  mocha 1 10 has broken the use case i describe 
hi  the additional example had been demonstrated in the issue
yes it actually failed to install  but after a few tries  it worked  i occasionally got npm err  cb   never called  npm err  not ok code 0 on installing it  the formidable package wasn't the problem  but i didn't figured out  why this error happened 
yes  the  namespace tag is there in my doc block 
 customcommander it work yuidoc is new to me my mistake  thx very much 
ah  this was all my fault   we had symlinked folders containing js files  so yuidoc would traverse those files twice and that was the cause for duplication    also  thank you for pointing out the linknatives config option  it was exactly that which i omitted   
not a lot more i can tell you  tried this "real" example  exclude  "internet punycode js" and  because "punycode js" does not use yuidoc's exact syntax  i get a load of warnings on the command line  if i change the config to exclude  "punycode js" then i don't get any warnings  nevermind if i'm the only one having this problem   i've switched to jsdoc now in any case 
the following      seems not to render anything at all  hth

hi  i cloned the master from github today  so i guess it's the lastest version right  the "version" file tells me 3 7 14 1 regards kevin
i did not  thanks for the hint this is working fine  i went by the tutorial on the sqlcipher site  http   sqlcipher net ios tutorial    i figured that xcode would do that step "magically" by itself    thanks  chris
 sjlombardo thanks  did an integrity check and it also seems fine 
i'm using it as a part of sqlite https   github com andpor react native sqlite storage i have it integrated through cocoa pods  it doesn't crash every time  hard to repro  only happens in case debugging of the app is active  also crash doesn't happen on a simulator  looks like a race condition 
we are not using that many but 999 is limitation for us  we are using coredata request in form  identifier in     array   and 999 objects is relatively small number  if you check this out http   sqlite 1065341 n5 nabble com sqlite max variable number td43457 html 500000 is 36mb which is for these platform generally fine  actual data returned by the query like this would probably be much bigger  i understand that sqlcipher is used on many platforms and it makes sense to keep reasonable default  but we can change it in podfile only so it will affect its users only  another argument to increase it is that this is upper bound and actual limit can be changed dynamically  which is not possible other way around  i would assume that there are ways around this but we are not in control of generated query so we are kind of stuck 
i had read the source code，the use of 'pragma key' is not expected to convert the hex  the below syntax should be used instead   pragma hexkey   '3f2ae1c00a7ba5a8bf00fa7ac10da18e493065fc21c6769ff1bcdd1ce5366aeb'

e g  ajax loaded content binding  
well  inside my model  yep  my architecture did need that  i had this "render" method  but when rendering non interactive cells  no forms etc   it was fairly enough  so i just left
ah  it's ok  i found info in  change_log  https   github com apotonick cells blob master changes md  template engine part   d so in 4 0  each cell class should only allow one template engine 
thanks for the reply  i'm going to submit a pull request to update the readme when i get time  it took quite a long time to gather all the required information to make this work    
after update cells to 4 0 0 beta2  when i try to start server 
i attempted to implement this but don't understand enough about cells structure to do it quickly  so i looked to see if i could just implement it in my cell with this   but it seems like the block is ignored  related to the template builders  i'd rather bake in easy support but not the actual implementation  there are already 3 options  erector  arbre  and fortitude  mentioned  why not take the approach that cells does with rails helpers and just force users to add what they need 
what about method  that escape methods explicitly 
that works  though it's missing this commit  https   github com apotonick cells commit 08d85c79fef301f5f23419ca095b2f802ba42794 it also takes a while to detect changes  with the code from this repo  template changes are picked up instantly and   _cell rb  changes aren't picked up at all  using your branch  changes in both are picked up  but it takes numerous requests to get the new code  i am using a vagrant docker setup to develop  which means nfs is involved  but again  template changes would happen instantly with this repo  weird

oh  that's good to hear  1 4 x is the latest version in the redhat repositories  what version do you have  maybe there's an additional repository hosting more recent rpms  i noticed that epel is referenced in the docs  but i don't see the augeas rpms as being present there   i was currently looking for a workaround and it seems that the  php lns  lens is able to parse it correctly  it's pretty nasty though  so i prefer to use updated packages

   z  works fine  i still think that closing intentation for     z  should work in the same way  as you said  it is desired to leave some space at the last line  but i don't think that autoindentation should change the number of spaces  e g   because it is for programmer to decide how many spaces should be there  vim plugin will never know it for sure 
looks good  thanks
that's what i thought first too and been looking for a ways to achieve this with ycm  valloric youcompleteme#1225   but then saw that php c omni completion use tags so i now wonder why ruby doesn't have that one too  i'm not really sure that should be done but i wanted to raise this point  the difference in default omni functions functionality for different filetypes   if you think that should not be even considered  please close the issue

ok  to mess up was a badly chosen verb  what surround under fo  a does  when pressing ysiw" inside a word  it surrounds the word by the quotations marks " and the cursor stays close to the surrounded word  under fo+ a  the cursor jumps way off  and the spaces around the word are switched  somehow it doesn't occur to me why this ought to be this way  just scrupulously mentioning it though  one can get along well without fo+ a set 
everything else works ok  i went thru the examples in the docs  and they all work with the exceptions of the  vs  and  vgs  mappings  i don't get any errors or anything  when i press  s   it seems to behave just like the normal vim substitute command  could there be some kind of conflict with another plugin  if so  what's the best way to debug  here's my  vimrc  https   gist github com lynndylanhurley 4724994
yes  indeed is very curious  when i execute " g     normal wysiw "  the cursors goes to the last occurrence as if global executed correctly but i don't see any change in the buffer  the curious thing i was talking about is that the buffer is then marked as something has changed and i can undo and redo  but my eyes tell me that nothing is changing in there

hi  jmettraux  thanks for suggestions  i also think that cron syntax is better than that dynamic calculation  cron syntax isn't even bad to me   anyway i think that  will be a great addition  but i must say that i'd still prefer something like  scheduler every '4h'  at  '30m'   imho it doesn't have neither the obfuscated syntax of cron or the too conversational syntax of  'every 4 hours at minute 30'

for the internets and  jferris   you are correct ish  we have always been on 1 9 2  i had a few days prior removed test unit from the gemfile because during a review of our dependency tree  it appeared to not have any ancestors  we use rspec 2 8 and had been using shoulda 2 11 3  the removal of test unit caused no problems  i assume somehow the library was still being loaded  as it is probably installed on the server  when we upgraded to shoulda 3 0 something changed in how it loaded test unit  and  though the shoulda based specs still passed  it also allowed for minitest to be loaded and run  on nothing  at the end  this was a very strange bug  but adding test unit back to our gemfile  with a note to prevent future removal  fixed the issue  and we are now upgraded to shoulda 3 0 1  thanks 
all my shoulda specs fails   rest of specs passes 
sorry  my bad  thought of something stupid   
oh  i thought that meant that you assigned this issue to you   
i can't reproduce this from either but you can see it with firebug here  http   jinsei ygamretuta me search q d however  note that for a couple of requests to that page the pjax does not fire  i am working on that  however  the firebug console tab should display the error
the author of the jstree jquery plugin issued a fix that seems to fix the problem  i think there are still some underlying issues with array sorting on chrome but i'm going to close this issue as my problem is fixed  if you want to see the jstree change that so far seems to fix the problem it is at  https   github com vakata jstree commit 9c41e435d5aee9647e26500200e30b359bb96ae0
sorry  i think the right code is  i   arr length  
i was using 0 3 0  when i use the master branch  i get an error 
apologies ilya  i corrupted my code posting in the process of cutting  pasting  and editing to protect the sensitive info  here's how i ran it just now   which returns the bucket listing  amazon never got the ' frame00096 jpg' portion of the path  all it saw in the second case was the bucket url without the path 
ok  i tried and confirmed that reverting https   github com eventmachine eventmachine commit 3c39365435f45c534a317779ae33cf1242b49352 fixed the problem  so  it seems like a regression indeed 
i get this  if you see is the same result  some time return and some time not return
i agree this is not valid http behaviour  but i was never saying it was  the main issue here is that by sending such response to the application  it's possible to cause a crash within the event loop  as a developer i have no control over what's happening inside the loop  all logic comes from the gems s   and therefore cannot handle the exceptions that happen in there  as i mentioned in the opening post  uncaught exceptions in event loop can cause issues  e g  thin webserver not able to recover from it   so  it's mainly a security issue  a malicious user might send such invalid response on purpose to cause crash within the application and potentially take down the whole site  or someone could do it inadvertently with the same results  as for the server  it has been fixed and no longer returns such duplicate response 
ok  i agree 
 tml yeah that would work perfectly 
let me remove the extraneous elements   the following elements are involved    hsl requires percentages on saturation and lightness  the second and third elements    hsla was minimized to hsl as the opacity was 1   rgba has an alpha  so it was kept  but the leading 0 was removed as it is non necessary   the trailing semicolon was also removed  i believe this is already done 
very interesting  so it appears that running the jar directly as you indicated works as expected  the problem seems isolated right now to the node js script  in this instance  i'm using homebrew to install  npm   and then i've used that  npm  to install the  yuicompressor  package  from there  i get an executable  yuicompressor  to run from the command line  as is expected for packages like this   i referenced  uglifyjs  earlier  for example   you can see my try to use first the jar and then the npm script  http   showterm io 00a959c8fad20d46edb93 i'm not really familiar with how to do packaging for node js  so i don't know how to recognize what layer of the setup is to blame 
i think that's self explanatory 
thanks  joey  here is a simplified example illustrating a list of users defined   1   via inline javascript  and  2   via an external ssi file  each uses the browser console to dump result for testing 
this is freebsd 10 3  x86_64 running the latest erlang  18 3  from ports 
debian version   it works just fine  which is good  the  make clean  is necessary as the binaries that are in  bin  by default crash on startup on my system  i apologise for wasting your time on my silly error  but i hope the informatioń i have provided can be of some use anyway 
i’m just getting started with lfe  i’d be happy with 1 3  the latest official release   if it works with the latest otp  nixpkgs has r22  and doesn’t have any issues of its own 
sorry forgot to add the version but it is the most recent  2 7 0 i passed him an already normalized url  my expectation would be that he would do nothing but he is removing characteres ' 2b' and invalidating my url  please correct me if i'm wrong  thanks

i thought that that was what the " release" compiler option mentioned here  https   docs scala lang org overviews compiler options index html did    but i see it doesn't mention version 10  are you saying that providing "9" instead of "10" _will_ generate java 9 bytecode  haven't tried  
thanks  davidb  i was preparing to do all kinds of code restructuring  you just saved me a days work 
there is no workaround when you use  scala run  from the command line  imho  the run target should not re use the  args  option which has the "add to the call of the favorite scalac tool" semantic 
thanks for the response  we did end up using maven profiles to simulate the skip  as you said  there are multiple goals and we see that only one of them  scaladocjarmojo  has a skip property  is there a reason the others do not  our use case is running integration tests in docker  the plan is to let maven run as usual  but perform the   verify   stage in docker  the problem is that running   mvn verify   in the docker causes all the previous steps to unnecessarily run again  this causes the build to take a very long time  to solve it  we've added a skip in the pom to all the plugins when running in the docker  this worked for all the plugins except the scala plugin  we ended up solving it by using maven profiles

sure  i wasn't really certain so i asked first in case someone else knew better 
looks great 
indeed  things are probably more complex than just negating the increment  thanks for looking into this  great work on this code btw

i have upgraded datetime  timezone  local from version 1 85 to version 1 88  but still  the problem persists  it seems that this is an issue with datetime  timezone  local itself  thanks for your time  i agree  this doesn't look like an issue with dist  zilla  i will now myself look into datetime  timezone  local and my local system configuration 
thanks karenetheridge for your quick reply  i was trying to customerize the basic bundle and realized that i removed makemaker from the list  after i added makemaker into the list  dzil test worked  my intention was i don't need makemaker but i need testrunner which i manually added to dist ini  i'll take a closer look at the makemaker code and see if i can do this  thanks again

yeah  i realize that it can't be enforced on all platforms  we're building a native binary using maven exec to run make  and if the wrong version of a dev library is installed the output package won't run  we have numerous linux build systems  most are developer vms  and there are problems keeping package cfg's sync'd  so we sometimes have to debug a case of non functioning binaries that usually ends up being a build depends violation on the build system 
i could try but only in a week or so since i will be out of office for a week  i'll get back to this issue     +1 
 tcurdt 1 6 x would be great   tmortagne   that's the current "workaround"  the problem is more between maven  ivy and sbt handling plugin dependencies weirdly  at least for me   stil the slf4j api isn't moving at a very high pace  so a version bump to 1 6 6 will help out for months years

hello ludo  i tried the example which is there in the plugin  it works well with chrome and mozilla  still in ie it just looks like a normal table which is the same problem i am facing that working on chrome and mozilla but not in any version of ie  do you have a fix for this  i have attached the screen shot of how the example file in the plugin looks in chrome and ie  i'm using the latest version of the tree table  please see the screen shot of code from the developer tools in ie    header  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7662128 3056705 b8c65c26 e1cd 11e3 852f b5c25b7e2baa png    body  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7662128 3056706 b8c65154 e1cd 11e3 8790 cf383d563e7f png    treetablediv  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7662128 3056704 b8c61540 e1cd 11e3 85a3 04a43a64f10f png    inchrome  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7662128 3053746 405b0422 e1ae 11e3 9d14 96c67fa4eac7 png    inie11  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7662128 3053747 405b3690 e1ae 11e3 9ed3 a39eb6e45434 png 
i have got more than 50000 rows but i have solved the issue using setinterval in which i am loading the rows in parts suppose i have 1000 rows then i am loading the rows in the bundle of 100s 
i'm sorry i had to reformat that box so not sure  it was either ubuntu server 8 04 or 9 10 with up to date package  i hope the other guy can provide the detail  btw at least on centos it's sqlite3  version  only one dash

webkit  if it sees a post request with an iframe or flash embed  will prevent it from loading in the result page  this gives the illusion it didn't work  though a refresh will show it did  it's to stop people from trying  page  script alert 'hi'   script    then when you go notice "page # params 'page'   isn't a valid page" you get an xss attack 
i also agree as it's breaking with nokogiri but it is happening as i implement sanitize clean params  in my sinatra post route  so i thought may be you can give a guidance  i tried with requiring active_support indifferent hash extension but still did not work  post " post" do sanity   sanitize clean params  #breaking in this line p params inspect post   sanity  post  end
yes  that workaround works

nick  thanks for replying  actually  the issue is that we don't expect at 404  but somehow the responsecapture gets a 404 and then resets the session  even more odd is that even though the response capture is a 404  our app "works" as expected  except for the inability to write to cookies   chris
we do have one left in office  i can try to ask my manager about it  for what it seems from virtual machine  the horizontal is captured but output as deltay and there isn't anything in the meta data that could tell us it is a horizontal scroll  i tried a fix from mdn for scroll handling and it has same issue in the vm  so let's hope it's a vm issue  i will double check on this

now i have the latest mongoid version 3 1 2  but i've used validates_timeliness with all the versions from 3 0 to 3 1 2 and never had any problems aside of the one described  before_typecasting is being broken if the methods are not overridden by the validates_timeliness' methods  mongoid puts into before_type_cast values  already parsed by timeliness   and if they are overridden  then everything seems to work just fine  may be i'll take a look at the mongoid 3 branch when i have time 
i didn't have it but i do have now and the spec above still don't want to pass  if it will help or if it will turn out as a new issue  when i uncomment the following line  config enable_multiparameter_extension   i get the error

in default wine   yes  but q4wine change those symlinks to  prefix_name  desktop integration  anyway  i want to change it to another place  i think a shell script will be more flexible solution  for example i want to delete wine file associations  delete symlink to root partition  which i can do through fake drive settings  and create symlink inside prefix  i have program installed on another drive   yes  it will be good

i've tried build using  texteditor xcworkspace   but i still get the following issues   lexical or preprocessor issue 'omnifoundation ofobject h' file not found 
i'm using django 1 8 6  python 2 7 10 on windows 7 ide   pycharm 5 0 1 now i added to settings py this lines media_root   ' media ' media_url '127 0 0 1 8000 media  urlpatterns        url r' media avatars '  include 'avatar urls'    url r' avatars '  include 'avatar urls'      and now when added avatars they are store in  media avatars  user  directory but system still generated page with error 404 now link to the avatar look like  img src "http   127 0 0 1 8000 media avatars andrzej resized 80 34564807 png" alt "andrzej" width "80" height "80"   image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 608413 11786809 eece054e a288 11e5 8039 93250972166d png 
hi  with the code above  the category functional test fails  1  error  test_should_destroy_category categoriescontrollertest   activerecord  recordnotfound  couldn't find category with id 27 machinist  1 0 6  lib machinist active_record rb 56 in  make'  test functional categories_controller_test rb 55 in test_should_destroy_category' once i add the _id   2   thing it works 
ok  i'm sorry  it was a legimit "save failed" because of a validation  i thought it was machinist's fault because of the way the error was display but it's not  that being said  i think i still have a legitimate error caused by machinist  that is  i can't use relationship between tag and post  blog application   when i add a tags 3  attribute to the post blueprint  i get an error 'stack level too high" 
thank you
sigh  i did   but i had a typo  false alarm and thanks for the followup

i'll have to see if i can get a test case to repro again
now its installing 2 3 5 instead of 2 3 8  not a big deal though  seems fine  any chance of getting it to work with both activesupport 2 and 3  i can help if needed 
i replaced the conflicting versions in  serve gemfile  with the older versions and installed with    rake install  but i keep getting this error 
yes sorry  shame on me  i was editing the stylesheet public stylesheet screen css in place of  stylesheets screen scss  s  it's a very useful gem  thanks

hi  thank you for your response  all my clipboard external settings ware disabled  now i enabled "clipboard external xclip" and installed xclip application  i don't use xwindow   just console  but when i try to delete a line  ctrl+d ctrl+d  i receive the same error i mentioned above 
hmmm  there's been a bunch of changes since i last saw 1 0  i did a big face palm when i realized that 0 12 1 wasn't what i was forking here on github  and i burned a whole lot of time as a result  so    some time passed and i  again  returned to creating a solr gem  based on rsolr  but ripped from the actual gem  i just needed ot make sure that what i was touching in "production" was also what i was working on in my github account  it looks like 1 0 has been simplified a whole lot  from before  so i'm not sure i have a huge reason to go off on my own with a separate solr gem  i can try and fork + merge changes into rsolr 
i will give it a try and let you know how it works  from  gregory todd williams  mailto notifications github com  sent  thursday  april 03  2014 1 15 pm to  kasei perlrdf cc  jeff benton subject  re   perlrdf  can't generate execution plan for optional property named 'aggregate'  #101  i believe commit ae3f558https   github com kasei perlrdf commit ae3f558 should fix the problem  can you confirm that  — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com kasei perlrdf issues 101#issuecomment 39485520 
those are good suggestions  i do use rvm and i it is integrated with bundler   project  zeus rspec  works in shell mode  is there a way to see the environment of a compilation buffer  here is my setup using el get   note that i have two commits that were required to get rspec verify working with zeus  https   github com teaforthecat rspec mode commit 8611e5b3957f5de05657cf80a29713cf29f32985 https   github com teaforthecat rspec mode commit 20bbc8fd1d50757bcd0dc8fa14918dbed2ebd237

one reason would be space   you aren't cluttering up the database with null pointers  also  one of the advantages of couchdb is the fact that you don't have to create a schema for your database  you just toss things in  by having to specify properties on the model and then have these propagate to the database seems to be against the spirit of couchdb  as far as the map function goes   if it is not there then it will not be displayed  the coolest thing about couchdb is that documents can be of variable length  i am quite sure that you are aware of this  but i spent some time writing the following example i am just going to include it anyway for anyone else who might be interested  let me try to explain myself through example  lets say i want to create a database that will store everyone i know including any associated addresses and other details about them  lets call this database 'contacts'  within contacts we can put pretty much whatever we want within it  some of the contacts i have i know quite a bit about  others i may only know their name  in a relational database i would have to create all the fields for all the types of information i would like to store  couchdb on the other hand allows me to add fields to documents when and where i need them but doesn't clutter up the database with null pointers on documents that don't have certain associated information  here is what a typical person would look like in a relational database  table   tr   td people  td    tr   tr   td first_name  td   td last_name  td   td phone  td   td address_1  td   td address_2  td   td pager  td   td relation  td    tr   tr   td john  td   td doolittle  td   td 555 555 5555  td   td 432 3rd st  td   td 123 5th ave  td   td null  td   td brother  td    tr   tr   td jason  td   td bourne  td   td null  td   td null  td   td null  td   td null  td   td friend  td    tr   tr   td jill  td   td haverson  td   td 555 235 5521  td   td null  td   td null  td   td null  td   td friend  td    tr    table  in couchdb  you only need to specify what you have  and can always come back later to add information  this is how the same would look like in couchdb  this is my understanding of couchdb and where the differences are between couchdb and relational databases  does it matter if there are null pointers  probably not  but i feel that it does get rid of some of the flexibility of the platform if you have to explicitly define a schema in the model 
sure  i did and it didn't pick it up for test environment  or any other fwiw   here's my config   can you replicate the code i specified above 
thanks  copiousfreetime for the quick reply  i installed jekyll via  the file seems to be there as you mentioned 
it seems that https   www radios com br players listen radio m3u  radio  37027 works as a redirection link to https   server02 ouvir radio br 8050 stream  i added this last link to the stations file and it worked 
yes  though it would be great to add this info to the readme md  i know it's not specific to qlmarkdown  but it greatly improves the usefulness of qlmarkdown 
thanks for the quick reply  i am on 10 12 1  i have tried deleting various things as recommended on some threads   plists  cache  qlmanage folder  helper etc   and restarting but to no avail  same problem with the mmd quicklook qlg   it shows the marked up text but not rendered html  best regards  keith
yes here is a link to the pxe boot from the same notebook to the original server  i only see the source port as difference  http   robert penz name files tftp_working pcap how easy is it to make a quick and dirty patch for tftpy to use 69 as source port  just for testing 
seems that this may be an edge case  or considered as designed  the simplest situation i could come up with is a div that has no content   the behavior seemed wrong because i was going back and editing existing code and vim haml was "fixing" the indent for me 
here is that 
here is the output
yep it got called  i did heroku restart to get the log from loading the intrumentations and then i loaded streamed page to make sure it gets called 
  gem  v 1 8 11 active support is 2 3 14 1 i added these lines using my limited ruby knowledge  require 'active_support' # checking for loaded_specs puts "                     " puts "1" puts gem loaded_specs puts "                     " puts "                     " puts "2" puts gem loaded_specs 'activesupport'  puts "                     " puts "                     " puts "3" puts gem loaded_specs 'active_support'  puts "                     " puts "                     " puts "4" gem loaded_specs each do name value  puts "# name   # value " end puts "                     " and i got this output                                              if you can give me another method to output this value  i can try that too 
i tried to  require 'vimeo' on console and  also  i installed the gem oauth  but nothing

right now only mpdscribble supports this feature  i dont know any c  but here is the relevant commit  http   git musicpd org cgit master mpdscribble git commit  id 27187d3585c59f3b8a0a08b02afb49416ed876b1 no client apart from mpc uses this yet  but with mpc you can already set the love flag 
the problem for me is pollution of the global namespace   window    i am writing an api  to a widget  which includes _sylvester_  i have no control over the javascript on pages that include the api's javascript interface  so  with the stock sylvester code  there could be conflicts  amd is a great way to keep code organized in several files without polluting the global namespace  with the above code  loading sylvester is just _plug and play_  there are further  universal module definition patterns  https   github com umdjs umd   to support more module loaders simultaneously 
i should have looked deeper  when i saw below in  add  i automatically thought  array map      this map function x  i  j    return x + m i 1  j 1       but maybe it doesn't hurt to add a note about compatibility in readme

i can't reproduce it anymore because i uninstall 1 8 7 and install 1 9 2 and it works fine  so i will close this issue
looks like it does  could that be the default value if g speeddating_no_mappings    1   doesn't fix mswin either  feels to me like integrating with other plugins should be an option instead of the default  but i can go with your solution if you want to close

ok  so i just checked the actual  setup py  at https   pypi org project aipy 3 0 0rc2   and it does  not  have the conditional that chooses between py2 and py3    it is hard coded to depend on  'astropy  1 0   2 0'   which will definitely fail for py3  that makes bumping the pypi version very urgent

i added a  puts  opts  seed   to  native rb  just before the call  results   i think this number should fit into an  int … i am confused  i'm a bit new to ruby so i'm not totally sure how to get a  printf  in the c code to look at what  s  looks like there and have it built  i don't suppose you have any pointers  i'm sure i can figure it out  but don't know where to start

thanks  sunny i went away thinking about this for a while  i thought it would be nice to include extra controls to the already web interface controls as it stands  i would like the user to feel as though they can fully use all the music play options as if it were their faviourite music player of any vendor ie itunes  amarok etc  with this mind  i thought about laying out the web interface control to make it look like a remote control  just like you have for your home entertainment system  perhaps like a widget type interface or something similar

hi  i agree with you  it is hard to define the exact percentage of completion of one task  but today i was working on a project report and i decided to complete it later  when i'll see my tasks list it would be great if i could see something like this    it will remind the user of the work almost done by a number estimated  entered  by him herself on a task  it's just a number like 97  put by the user before leaving his project  like a note or a small sentence like "almost done"  or "need a conclusion" but maybe this feature is too specific  by the way your idea is great  but in my mind it's thought about something else 
i created the following path     bin fortune  there i placed the file called fortunes i also have generated the  fortune dat  file  when i faced the error i cloned your fortune and fortune dat files from  https   github com bmc fortunes  and i still have the same error  i created the environment variable in my   bashrc  file   export fortune_file   bin fortunes fortunes    have you tested fortune in windows

i thought the logging out is a security feature to prevent your profile being used by someone else after you leave your device  i think that is a decent feature  provided the related usability issues are addressed  i regularly return to pages and find i am logged out  whereas i return to facebook google and am never logged out  this issue does not appear to be limited to any particular page  though i haven't done enough research to be certain of the contexts that apply 
there are cases where you do not want anyone passing by the door to register and enter your site  but the existing members of the site should be able to invite their friends  is there any other way of "membership by invitation only"   other than admin "adding a new user" via the admin panel  which is a bit too centralized  
i see that liststyle remove from removeplugins     and the error was wrong  sorry  
now i checked it on live site and it works the url is somthing like http   www example com admin_plugin_text_file categories readme md so in live site it's ok  but in localhost site that the site is in subdirectory  i get this error  the url is http   localhost elgg200 admin_plugin_text_file categories readme md

thanks for your help   i have tested again on a clean install  with only core plugins enabled  and cannot reproduce it either  i'm currently investigating where this comes from  but at least it looks like this issue is not a core issue  i'll keep you informed in case i find some clear explanation on what happened   
yeah  that sounds good 
i understand your reasoning  makes sense to have just 1 interface and leave it up to the users to implement their own  hopefully i find some time this week to contribute this interface to the docs 
i did some more tests  with "don't compile" i meant that just pasting the default code and using the obvious imports didn't work  you need  of course  static imports for the stop    restart   and escalate   methods and directive interface to work as used in the original example  but curiously  even this doesn't work 
thank you for the pointers 1  removing plugins did not help 2  but the following  3  is 12 sec as good as it gets  what are you guys are getting from repeated  time sbt exit    4  probably should reflect this in http   doc akka io docs akka snapshot dev building akka html
yes konard  i would like to contribute  would you please tell how to do it 
 patriknw my code not run i don't know you say
oh interesting  makes sense  yes  default case would be fine i'm sure  shall i cook up a pr  or i can test on this end once one is put together  thanks 
i have no real reason  i was just experimenting with it  and this behavior seemed unexpected  i thought that actorselection tell was more or less the same as actorref tell 
 sirthias just can not run  formdata parts runforeach  function  can not catch any errors 
yep sorry about that    i still have tests failing in my code because after upgrading to m4 i don't receive oncomplete anymore when using a pushpullstage  i'm using a test probe "borrowed" from some internal testkit  i'll investigate why i have this problem and let you know if i find anything
encountered this again tonight after using 2 4 snapshot successfully for a few weeks  similar trace as before 
 svozniuk stream refs only allows to maintain location transparency  this is still far from sharding singletons  if a machine on which stream was materialized  dies for any reason  you need to manually acknowledge that fact and move graph to another one  same thing concerns rebalancing  here the idea was to expose potential streaming capability on several machines and let them to switch from one to another in case of failure 
yeah i just stumbled upon that page  i would include links to it from all of the introduction documents under something like  get akka  would be perfect
my configuration
i'm trying to set charset within httpresponse as 
 patriknw yes  the behavior that i see is different from what you are describing  i have a small test program that creates a  tailchoppingpool  of size 3  then  the test sends 9 messages to pool's actorref  if the  tailchoppingpool  were implemented as you are suggesting  then each of the actors in the pool should receive exactly 3 requests   because the first 3 request will be distributed in some random order to the 3 actors  and then next 3 requests should be distributed again in a  possibly  different order  and so on  but what i observe is that on some test runs one actor receives more than 3 messages while others receive less than 3  my guess is that this is a defect in the implementation of  tailchoppingpool   but i still do not understand the intended behavior of the class well enough to say for certain if it is a defect  or simply my misunderstanding of what this type of pool is supposed to do  what do you think  i can post the source code for my test program if you think that would help 
i see  i wish i had it in the logs  but i don’t  what is the safest way to consume the entity for logging purposes  without affecting the rest of the code 
i found this after a bit of searching  http   stackoverflow com questions 6243051 how to pass an array within a query string it seems there is not a well defined standard way to do this  personally  i prefer   cars saab audi  since it is the most compact and makes it clear there are multiple values for one named query parameter  this is a new api i'm building  so i don't have anything existing i need to interoperate with

no additional settings  outcome is an excetion   usually after only 4 5 requests  but it's not predictable 
we are using akka 2 4 6  i can try to see if i will be able to have a reproducer for this  sometimes after same stream interruption we see  which i think was fixed in other ticket 
yep  that's correct  right now  i have constructed a class to encapsulate the statename and statedata persistentfsmsnapshot s    fsmstate  d    serializable    so that i can easily jump to the snapshotted state similar to how statechangeevent works   initially this was set up because we were using a persisted snapshot store  but a ephemeral journal  but that has since changed to accommodate a distributed system backed by cassandra persistence  in theory  this may work similarly to truncating the journal on every statechangeevent  but there is some value for us to be able to control when snapshots happen like snapshotting when we come down cleanly  even if there were no state changes   there is also value to keeping the journal around just in case we have to do some recovery if our snapshots are somehow corrupted  the journal also has some benefits as an audit trail  but snapshotting should give us a quick means to restore without playing back a potentially very large journal 
not for now  are you planning to have a new distro any time soon 
should be set  also added a requestnext d  finiteduration   let me know if there's anything else i should do to make it better 
 raboof by splitting i meant using  flowops splitwhen  or  flowops splitafter   which return  subflow   you supply   elem     boolean  to  splitwhen   splitafter  to do splitting  but if it is stateful it's not safe because it will be shared between different materialisations 
 ktoso could you please clarify why  scala stream graphs  https   github com akka akka blob master akka docs rst scala stream stream graphs rst  contains  naïve   umlaut   but  java stream graphs  https   github com akka akka blob master akka docs rst java stream stream graphs rst  contains  naive   not umlaut

do you recommend using a new version of akka actor  does akka have a newer version of akka actor_2 10 that uses scala library 2 11 x 
sorry  i expected scala to have more general annotation for warnings  custom method with  deprecated  is closest to what i want  but that can cause even more confusion   
i am confused about the third parameter  it is the identity of the message  eg   object tostring      getclass   getname   + ' ' + integer tohexstring hashcode      or the sender's path  or something else

i do share the same worry about complexity  perhaps we should just focus on the single type that is most generalizable  the one to one operator    flowfunction  for now  the "pass through" is the first and most obvious use base i can come up with for  flowfunction   it itself is quite general though  it would certianly be useful in the various alpakka connectors  that currently have to implement their own "pass through" like mechanism   kafka's flexiflow for example  https   doc akka io docs akka stream kafka current producer html#producer as a flow    often when dealing with graphs  i notice that we may want to conditionally run an element through a flow stage  if it meets some condition  by having the guarantee of a one to one flow stage  we could create a wrapper flow stage around  flowfunction in  out    turning it into a  flowfunction either out  in   out    if the input is of type  right in    it will run it through the given flow stage  if the input is of type  left out    it will "short circuit" the passed in  flowfunction   and simply unwrap the type to an  out   i have noticed the desire for this pattern in two cases  1  when consuming messages off kafka  we may decide that the kafka message is not worth processing  cannot be parsed  no useful contents  etc   but we still want to track its offset  and commit it later  order must be preserved in this case  so we can't depend on  zip  or  merge  with basic  flow in  out   for a short circuit  2  when patching together an api that has many dependencies  we may want to "short cricuit" the critical path if say  authentication fails  short circuit to a 401   turns out there are no results  short circuit to a 204   etc  currently  we can do this by throwing exceptions and blowing up the graph  but there are several downsides to that  a graph completely composed of  flowfunction  stages could be used in a nice "black box" kind of way  by leveraging  source queue  and  sink queue   we could "materialize" a  flowfunction a  b   into a  function a  future b     this would play very nicely with the rest of the scala ecosystem  one of the issues linked above  #22975  discusses "projecting a value from a tuple"  although it is jumbled into the other "pass through" tickets  it seems like a bit of a different use case to me  allowing us to enrich a single element of a tuple  while preserving the rest  i looked through the other open github issues in t stream  and nothing popped out to me  but i'm curious if anyone else has any ideas too 
logs attached  the format of the logs is    timestamp   log   node which emitted the log    the full log is really large so i've taken an excerpt that shows the problem   cluster_failure txt  https   github com akka akka files 1506879 cluster_failure txt 
that's fine  not a lot of code to copy for those who need it 
akka version is 2 3 12  before down  i was searching for the other ports like  state and found out there ware too many ports of same state  in this case  do i kill all of them 
sure  i should be able to come up with a pr with a fix sometime later this week  however  i might need some guidance on how to write unit tests for it  as i have no experience with testkit and reproducing the race condition on sharedbuffer polling might be non trivial 
ok  will create a pull request with the separate  withloglevel level  loglevel   method
sure
cluster leaving was graceful  from cassandra   i guess i can try to fix this myself 
i can try  but i haven't contributed to this codebase before    may take a while to figure it out 
there is indeed an async boundary  otherwise the execution would not jump threads  the question is then  why those async boundaries do not make execution parallel  if i knew the answer i would be very happy to create a pr  but i don't 
i see the chaining possibility  but you can also do this   val fileprop   objectfactory fileproperty   convention file "   "    the only difference is that  value    does not work with a provider  strangely   it seems to me that using  convention  over  set   value  still does not provide any behavior differences on the instance  we are currently looking at using  property string     and  int     boolean    etc     in some places in our dsl where  do  want to have nullable values  and wondered if  convention  would be an interesting way to encode the default in the property while still allowing  and testing for    null  values  right now it seems like we should just ignore  convention   and please don't remove the ability to set a null value   
i was just about to ping back on this   bmuschko was the one who did the first review 
that's right ben  we have a single project that still works fine  but in our multiproject test we're now getting the provided jars in the war and included in the copy task  the reduced example i provided gives you all the code  so you don't need to go hunting    my _guess_ is that it's got to do with this  https   github com danielthomas provided reduced blob master buildsrc src main groovy providedbaseplugin groovy#l44 l47
 eriwen i was able to reproduce the issue with  gradle 3 1  and  gradle 3 2 1  on  windows 10 1511   i have created a minimal sample project to repro the issue at https   github com alexanderfloh javadoc issue repro  after running  gradlew javadoc  take a look at the contents of  build docs javadoc index html   the title is   title         title    it seems to me that this is already incorrectly encoded in the  javadoc options  file written by the gradle plugin  navigating to  build tmp javadoc javadoc options   you'll see lines like  thanks for looking into this  let me know if you need anything else 
 oehme no  only with  failfast  
most uses can be replaced by  findproperty   previously they were like  project properties 'foo'   i do have one bit of code though that is mainly used by ci builds  it allows arbitrary properties to be set just by adding a property like  env org_gradle_project_some customextension property  to the teamcity build config this is basically implemented via  project properties grep   it key startswith someprefix    each      use eval xy to get the value into the extension    where someprefix is dictated by the plugin that calls this code  no doubt i could replace this with something a bit more targeted 
 huxi i saw that as well but we're not invoking the  gradlebuild  task anywhere in our pipeline  are you thinking this might still be related maybe behind the scenes in some way 
sure  i can do that 
i listed 2 issues  let me clarify a bit  1  issues with proper sync of the artifactory  for performance reasons our company uses local artifactory which contains all the artifacts required by different teams  but sometimes the sync fails resulting in missing files  in this case the gradle works more predictably   the pom really does list correct metadata but not the jar  2  example with 'com viewpagerindicator library 2 4 1' is more interesting  the original library was deprecated  but the corresponding tooling  android plugin  has changed the format of the artifact  from apklib to aar   but the author of the library never repackaged it  so some other guy just published repackaged artifact with same id and version but with in different format  in this case even the metadata is different so i was expecting gradle to look for artifact in other repository  you can compare them  http   dl bintray com populov maven com viewpagerindicator library 2 4 1 library 2 4 1 pom https   jcenter bintray com com viewpagerindicator library 2 4 1 library 2 4 1 pom 3  third issue is imaginary  but i believe this scenario might theoretically occur  one might list several repositories just for the sake of reliability  with the hope that in case of connection error gradle will recover and use the second repository 
i created a  gradle aether plugin  https   github com uklance gradle aether  to workaround the issue which resolves transitive dependencies in  aether  https   projects eclipse org projects technology aether  instead of gradle
sure  sounds good to me 
i'm sorry  i was wrong about  'i love subdirectories bin'   that works fine  but  ''  does not work  in that case there is one      too much 
sure  i boiled it down as much as i could  do  gradle init   copy  to  build gradle  and run the task  runbuildtasks  
i'll test it  but i cannot reopen a ticket  i can only comment  besides that  i tried to execute the test you mentione  but wasn't able to  how do you run it  if i run with    gradlew codequality integtest   tests 'org gradle api plugins quality findbugs findbugsintegrationtest can generate html reports with a custom stylesheet'  i  on java 11  the test is not run as it is marked to only run with java 8  if i run the same with java 8  the whole build complains  that it cannot be run with java 8 and if i remove the java 8 requirement the test of course fails  because the asm version in findbugs cannot parse the file compiled with java 11 
forget  provider filecollection    it was just a side thought  my use case was actually what i exampled above  having a  directory  property  in my case i don't have a plugin creating that task  it is just a task for this one project and created in the build script directly  but only one instance will ever exist and the property does not need to be defined from outside  it can simply be defined inside the task as shown  so now i use  but if you say it is a technical   conceptual limitation  just close this issue  i just wondered that it doesn't work with a  directory  directly and that i either have to transform it to a  filecollection  or wrap it in a  provider  
 eriwen no worries and thank you for making it more concrete  your proposal sounds good to me  but let me reach out to a few people  yes  exactly  i haven't written a clojure plugin myself yet  but i've been in touch with several who have tried  i'd like to bring them into the mix because it's ultimately one of their plugins that i'd like to start from and use  if it makes sense  give me a little bit of time to reach out to them and see if i can bring the other clojure plugin authors into the fold  especially since they face similar issues   and thank you so much for the offer  i'd definitely like to take you up on it  even if they don't 
i just reproduced the issue on another machine with identical firefox version  but i think the version is not so critical since the issue existed already in november   i don't remember ever having problems with gradle docs website on this machine  i ctrl clicked those links in the order you provided and nightly opened without a problem  but remaining two started lagging and finally displayed the warning 'web page slowing down'  afterwards opening nightly docs stopped working as well  initially i had  adblock  https   addons mozilla org en us firefox addon adblock for firefox   and plasma integration extensions enabled  but disabling them and restarting the browser does not help  opening pages in privacy mode does not help as well 
 bmuschko i haven't got an older jdk version installed  but  reportedly  https   issues apache org jira browse lucene 7651  it does  the option "crept in" with 8u121  from the  release notes  http   www oracle com technetwork java javase 8u121 relnotes 3315208 html   as the issue is not public  it's hard to say why they have introduced the option  either you do need javascript in the doc or you don't  if you do  you now have to pass that additional parameter  i cannot see a gain in security or anything here  it's just a d    nuisance  ideally  we'd parse the output from   javadoc   help   to find out if the option is supported  bad news      allow script in comments   doesn't appear in this output  maybe this is why the option has two leading dashes   maybe you can get the information from   javax tools optionchecker    didn't think of this before  i'll check it 
yes  thanks  closing as duplicate 
i think any project with long running parallel tasks will do  but in case if you struggle to find one  you can reproduce it on the kotlin build  of which i took that scan  the instructions are here https   github com jetbrains kotlin#building and the arguments were  clean install   parallel   console verbose 
isn't the example mentioned under "steps to reproduce  for bugs " above good enough 
sorry  clarification  it wasn't working in any version 
i actually have no idea how this issue starts since most of the time i'm in coding in the ides  eclipse  intellij   every once in a while i run the gradlew and i see that it has multiple unusable daemons running  in this case  i used   t   continuous  just to replicate the issue but i do use it on occasion   very useful 
sure thing  i'll give it a shot 
i made the title describe the symptom instead of suggesting the problem this time

sorry  yeah  my issue was super unclear  it's basically the same as #2016 but for providers  say i need to configure something based on what's in a folder  if the folder isn't there  i don't do anything  but if it is  i need to do stuff  since the folder doesn't change and isn't configurable by the user  i want the property to always be set  however  that doesn't work with gradle's model since it'll freak out if the file isn't there  so the question is  can you easily get the property and null it out based on some condition 
the error was not present in 4 1 and only started to occur after switching to 4 2  org gradle api reflect objectinstantiationexception  could not create an instance of type org gradle initialization defaultsettings_decorated  caused by  java lang stringindexoutofboundsexception  string index out of range  0 at org gradle initialization defaultsettings_decorated  init  unknown source      83 more
i can't make any promises about that  as i am currently quite busy even in my spare time  but if i find some time i will look into it 
thanks for the tip  hmm interesting it took me to a build yesterday   so it's likely false alarm then  will re open if the issue pops up again 
 bmuschko a minimal configuration would be more than enough for start  so no web frameworks would be required     build gradle  configured with the  war  plug in and tasks   a simple jsp page in the correct directory   a simple servlet in the correct directory   logging   test so basically not much more than the  java library  type  just tuned for the web 
i'll see what i can put together  in the meantime i think it may have something to do with my project using a deprecated output dir option   bmuschko do you have any projects handy that use this  i believe this may be what triggers the issue 
yes  you can see it  here  https   github com node gradle gradle node plugin blob d7c93365f4a257f3b6968dd1a80a05d3280814be src main kotlin com github gradle node npm task npminstalltask kt#l68   let me give you some context  this is the  npm install  task which creates or updates the  node_modules  directory that contains the project dependencies  oh  that's simple  let's declare this directory as a task output  yes  but unfortunately it is not so simple  some users reported us that there are some specific cases  not really legal i think but they exist  in which the code contained in the dependency modifies itself in the package directory  node gradle gradle node plugin#38   in the java world  we could compare that to a jar that you download from a repository which  when you execute it  modifies itself  🤔 the problem with that behavior is that the  npm install  task is no longer up to date and always runs  and it is not very fast   when it runs  it restores the dependency to its original content and when the dependency code runs  it modifies it again  to workaround this issue  we added an option that enables to filter out some patterns from the  node_modules  directory to target specifically those files that are updated  this is what does the  nodemodulesoutputfilter  option of the task  in this case  we use a file tree since we cannot filter out a directory  after releasing this change  we were reported that the  npm install  task was much slower than before  and specifically its up to date check  node gradle gradle node plugin#63   it sounds like   outputfiles  on a  filetree  is slower than   outputdirectory  on a  file   it's not so surprising   to fix this issue we had to declare two optional outputs and exactly one of them is not  null  according to the configuration  if you define a filter  it is the   outputfiles   else it is the   outputdirectory   so  for the   outputdirectory   we want it to be defined only when the  nodemodulesoutputfilter  is not defined  this is here i would like to  map   rather  flatmap   even if it's  null   i did not find any other way than breaking the  provider  chain using  getornull     hope my explanation was clear  and maybe it exists another way to handle this use case that would be more relevant  in this case  let me know 
 wolfs i'm using jdk 1 8 0_25 on both a red hat linux server and a sierra version of macos  i do believe the problem is something else than i thought  however  as i grabbed both the compiled jar from the ci server and my mac  and it turns out that there's a 1 byte difference between some  not all  of the compiled classes  here is a screenshot when i ran the sha sum on both classes and their file sizes  i'm not sure what's causing the compilation differences  but maybe it's on java's side and not gradle    screen shot 2017 08 04 at 8 48 41 am  https   user images githubusercontent com 5210461 28971555 fd92af76 78f1 11e7 992c ce4be14fa5e4 png 
i will not agree with you  you are not able to control the machine as a whole thing  your process may be killed spontaneously  assertions are good  but it creates layers of a hassle to others who got stuck with them  for example  the problems i reported i saw on ci machines  we have a pool of such machines  hundreds of them  and some now stopped to run gradle  for many projects  it is hard to ssh to each of them to have that trivial problem fixed  btw  such problems typically ruin the first user experience  technically  what may go wrong   a machine may crash suddenly   gradle and gradle wrapper process may be killed suddenly   a disk may be cleaned up suddenly or corrupted   network error may end up a broken file is downloaded and yes  the broken gradle file is what i had in my case  again  with ci machines  again it is hard to detect those machines and clean those folders  it does not feel like a rocket science to add some trivial assertions with means to self healing  it will just make our lives easier and without dumb errors which are time consuming to fix on and on again

agree  if you use     continue   this should still attempt to complete the other workers  just for reference i created a small example that is a slightly modified version of https   github com w25r worker api example in a nutshell it introduces a sleep task type that takes as arguments an amount of time it should sleep and if it should fail  the configuration of the tasks is the same as outlined above  but task 2 "just" sleeps for 30 seconds and task 1 fails after 10 seconds  this still shows the purpose of this feature request  the "work" done here is truly just sleeping  but that's not the point   issue 4296 zip  https   github com gradle gradle files 1707500 issue 4296 zip  edit  it would be also preferable to also have a programmatic way in telling gradle to ignore failures inside parallel worker tasks  besides using     continue     this would allow the flexibility to have the current behaviour or the suggested one but in the end its really up to the developer 
 oehme after resetting my gradle home and executing the command you requested everything worked correctly in versions 4 1 and 4 2 of gradle  it was probably some instability in the company network  i believe this issue can be closed  thank you for your help 
i tried deleting the file as suggested earlier  that makes the build run once 
yes i can work on that  but i would need some guidance on what would be the best way to make this configurable  i think it would make sense to have two optional configuration options  one to enable server side encryption at all and another one to specify the used key id  if they don't want to use the default one 
ok  it seems that the issue was happening only when i edited the script from intellij 2019 2 that comes with jetbrains runtime 11  which is a fork of openjdk11   for some reason idea kotlin plugin always uses this runtime for completion in kotlin scripts  for running tasks idea correctly uses jvm from gradle settings   my java_home is set to jdk 1 8  and properties  sourcecompatibility   targetcompatibility  properties set  so basically  buildsrc  was alternately built with jdk 1 8 +  sourcecompatibility   1 8  and jbr 11 +  sourcecompatibility   11   the issue seems to be mostly on intellij side  so this ticket can probably be closed  i wish  however  that alternating gradle daemons within the same project would be more visible to users  it is not a first  not even a second  time i'm seeing a performance issue caused by different daemons in ide and cli  because of different memory locale settings  jdk version  etc  
 1  you are right  i just checked again and also found that the presence of path sensitivity does not make a difference   i was experimenting with  pathsensitivity relative  earlier and didn't expect that this was still a bug without it  but turns out it is    2  yes that would work  the alternative is that gradle runs incrementally with the correctly reported changed files directories  i think both are acceptable  the latter is actually more efficient  but maybe the former is more straightforward  note that the above bug is exposed when the number of input directories changes across builds  however  even when the number of input directories doesn't change across builds  there seem to be a few unexpected details too  i'm listing them here in case you also want to address  scenario 1     run 1   gradlew sampletask  ptest 1     not expected   test1 0 classes dex  and  test1 0 classes2 dex  are not reported as out of date    run 2   gradlew sampletask  ptest 2     expected  all directories and files are reported   more scenarios  if you try using a mixture of  dir    and  files    with more input directories  then you'll get a mixture of reported directories  missing directories  reported files  missing files 
hi  here it is
hi ben  thanks for replying  i should clarify   i am not calling classpathutil anywhere  rather  i am working to convert a library from maven to gradle and this library registers custom uri schemes on the classpath  so while i am not directly invoking classpathutil  its expectation that the classloader's urls all use the file scheme causes failures during test compilation and test execution  i am not quite ready to share the library i'm working on as the gradle build is still a work in progress  once i iron out some bugs  though  i will be happy to share  for now  here's a preview of the stack trace  note that all namespaces are either from the jdk or gradle apis 
of course  please find it here  https   github com mkmaier gradle 3231
adding encoding header to  config xml  didn't help  also  codenarc built in rulesets don't have xml headers either  i tried to add there too  no change  i use codenarc in my own project  so this by its own can't be a reason  i'll try another machine  could it be an issue with  xerces   i know there are some incompatibilities between versions 
i tried both  verbose  and  rich   no visible difference  some update  bold font is supported by ansicolor too 
yea   seems to come from the kotlin plugin   just found this issue here  https   youtrack jetbrains com issue kt 17601   thanks
sure  i'll try that workaround  it should take about a week 
 bmuschko yes  i will work on a pr for this 
using a different property name  eg componentname as suggested  resolves the issue for me  thanks 
 oehme i did not share this over network  it's on my local machine  didn't configure anything  did following steps  1  install gradle 2  go to project directory 3  run this command   gradle  
 oehme should be reproducible with gradle 4 3 1 as well so it is not really a new issue 
afaik  we don't use any proxies  thing is mirror is only available inside corporate network and when i'm not in the office  or it's an open source project and someone else trying to build it  mirror would be unavailable  another approach could be  override distribution url prefix  without file name  via some environment property 
i tried with gradle 5 1 1 and 5 3 1  they both seem to have the issue  the dump is from gradle 5 1 1 
from what i see  all the sourcesets output are put in their corresponding bin folder  can you give an example of the situation where the bin default folder is being used 
there's a bug in 4 7  and probably 4 8  whereby gradle doesn't support nested tests in junit properly  there is an issue already open  and it's getting fixed  however in the meantime it would have been helpful if i could add a workaround in my project  https   github com kotlintest kotlintest issues 336   ideally i'd only want the workaround to appear when it's in a version of gradle that has the issue  and also  for example  not when running tests via intellij  because it reduces functionality so i don't want to to apply when it's a version of gradle that seems to work  that's one example  and i'm sure this kind of functionality might appear in the future 
thank you  lacasseio  i've passed your feedback along to the plugin owner  i can't think of any specific examples of documentation being misleading  but should  project evaluate  be deprecated if it's not compatible with the lazy task configuration api

sorry  i got it the way around  i meant treat 403 as missing  i have updated the title and description  when the dependency is missing  gradle will not try to download again  but it will when it gets a 403 forbidden  this makes a huge difference when we refresh the gradle project in intellij and some dependencies don't have sources for example  it means taking dozens of minutes versus just a few seconds 
here is the full trace  as i can see understand it's during executetransform  just as a note  replacing   while true   with something like   int j 0  while  j  0   does compile without any sort of hiccup

i cannot reproduce it now  looks like there may have been something else that was overriding settings 
yep rc3 is working for me again  just updated the linked pr
 ljacomet i understand what you say  but i still have a question  lets say i have 2 modules with dynamic version  i publish version 1 2 0 and 2 2 0 respectively and then consume them as so  i then realize that module1 has an issue and publish a patch therefore having a version 1 2 1 and since time has passed  module2 now has a version 2 3 0 that i don't want to use  so  to update the lock i run    gradlew dependencies   update locks com package module1  would this update module2 as well  if so  what the idea of specifying which modules i want to update  and if not  why does it update both in the case i have static versions  i only want to update those i told gradle to via the command
 melix indeed  but still i don't understand why it does not show up when i don't put any configuration 
 oehme my bad   i edited the original post to clarify  you are correct in that it only affects bat files 
thank you for your reply  the problem has been solved  i set no proxy in as  but forget set the file gradle properties   by the way   why i set proxy in as  the gradle properties will also seted   but i set no proxy in as  the file gradle properties is still    
the artifact "org flywaydb  flyway core" version "5 2 4" should be the same in all repositories  finding it in the first repository does not need to look for it in others  in this example  expected  1  look for "org flywaydb flyway core 5 2 4" in the mavencentral  2  found this artifact in mavencentral  stop searching in fact  what happens  1  look for "org flywaydb flyway core 5 2 4" in the mavencentral 2  found this artifact in mavencentral  we continue the search for this artifact further 3  look for "org flywaydb flyway core 5 2 4" in the jcenter 4  could not connect to the jcenter  they reported that we could not find "org flywaydb flyway core 5 2 4" because they could not connect to the jcenter  search all repositories should be only for dynamic versions of artifacts  but not for permanent ones

specifically  we get a warning about stable_publishing when publishing with gradle 4  https   docs gradle org 4 10 2 userguide publishing_maven html#publishing_maven deferred_configuration "prior to gradle 4 8  the publishing    block was implicitly treated as if all the logic inside it was executed after the project is evaluated  this caused quite a bit of confusion  because it was the only block that behaved that way  as part of the stabilization effort in gradle 4 8  we are deprecating this behavior and asking all users to migrate their build " i will say that the deferred configuration behavior caused us quite a bit of grief because we are modifying the default pom files generated by the tasks in the maven publish plugin  we are using the "taskgraph whenready" trick as a workaround  see https   discuss gradle org t maven publish not using version set dynamically in taskgraph whenready 19484 and https   discuss gradle org t modifying version number and publishing with new publishing plugin 4788 for others who have mentioned this   i am looking forward to ripping this out when i have time  but i suspect it will not be trivial  my company just switched from gradle 3 to gradle 4 a few months ago  and that took a few weeks of work  i'd like to avoid having to do that again to switch to gradle 5  to add more complexity  we have a lot of projects in play  and each of them independently declares which version of gradle it is using  most  but not all  of the projects have been switched to gradle 4 10  the remainder of the work is a bureaucratic issue  not a technical one  there are a few other "new feature added in gradle 4  old feature deprecated in gradle 4  old feature removed in gradle 5" issues that we papered over when we switched to gradle 4 10  we have about a dozen plugins that are shared across both gradle 3 and gradle 4 projects  so we can't actually completely remove usage of the old features yet without breaking the older projects  in some cases  we were forced to add "if gradle   4 do one thing else do another" logic  the publishing changes are complicated enough that we don't want to use this strategy  long story short  if we can't get the patches to use asm7 into gradle 4  we'll probably just use our own fork until q2 of next year  on mon  nov 26  2018 at 2 38 pm marc philipp  notifications github com  wrote 
it works fine in gradle 4 10 2  the only difference is that i switched to gradle 5  i'll put together a sample  on fri  nov 30  2018 at 11 58 am marc philipp  notifications github com  wrote 
thanks  it is the mirrors that are timing out    
i'm a little suprised but this bug goes back to gradle 3 5 it got introduced with the advent of gradle 4 0  the gradle 3 5 executes the above buld   with slight changes    replace register with create  with the following result   i also noticed something other while we are at finalizedby  this probably is not a bug but rather expected behaviour   but still is a bit troublesome  when i do stuff using the dolast callback it gets executed in the same  let's say transaction  it is executed before the output snapshot is taken  this yields the result that this actions do not interfere with up to date checks  the same cannot be said about the finalizedby dependencies   this tasks get executed in isolation and therefore the example i created kind of makes no sense  because the "do srv" tasks will always be executed because of the "clean srv" tasks removing some output  maybe there is a way to avoid this   it would be great if there was a way to tell gradle  always execute a and b together and then if i x dependon ' a' then before x executes a and b get executed   their execution order should be decided between them according to dependon and finalziedby    i know i colud achive the behavior by definiong custom tasks that will simply aggregate few tasks together   but this works well on java groovy written tasks  when it comes to javaexec   exec tasks this becomes troublesome as you can't resue thoose tasks and have to reinvent the execution process plumbing that is already there
that worked  thanks   
sure  i've got   tasks for various tools you can instantiate if they are in the build path    a base plugin with extensions that brings in the tasks and configure them with defaults from the extensions when you instantiate them    and several opinionated plugins that include the base plugin and establish and further configure task chains for specific purposes  the opinionated plugins configure themselves some task properties that are necessary for the chain to work  while leaving others connected to the defaults in the extensions  all is good for now  but there are some chain task properties that must be empty  null  for some chains to work  leaving those properties connected to the defaults in the extensions is brittle  for even if the default value for the extension defaults is null  as soon as those defaults are changed in the extensions the affected chains would cease to work  the correct way is for the opinionated plugins to break the connection imposed by the base plugin for those task properties that it crucially needs to be empty  hence the need to set some task properties to empty  null  when their previous values were references to mirrors default properties in plugin extension objects  hope this is clear enough 
thank you both for the explanation  that was the issue  we're now locking the runtime dependencies and the lockfiles include all we expected

i was able to pin it down to a single project  and it's dependencies of course   however the dependencies build fine   this project hat   64 500 loc and 478 compilepath dependencies  117 of which are projects   it's a functional testing project that depends on nearly everything of the built application  i tried to create a mvce but a multiproject build with 200 subprojects and a single aggregator project  resulting in 510 unique compilepath dependencies  that depends on all subprojects did not encounter the observed oom  however each of these projects contains a single java file only    sharing a heapdump of the actual project is not an option   sadly  but i can share some screenshots of my findings    path 2 gc roots that i got from a full build on the root project     path2gc_01  https   user images githubusercontent com 8697665 67303222 6bd69a00 f4f2 11e9 906c 094e75e39799 png    path 2 gc roots that i got from a build of the failing project only     path2gc_02  https   user images githubusercontent com 8697665 67303372 ae987200 f4f2 11e9 8917 48d9170a89b8 png  the paths in the second screenshot look kind of odd as it looks like the worker thread is holding a direct reference to the 750mb  hashmap node   in the first screenshot one can clearly see that  javacfilemanager  is holding the problematic reference    map contents example     2019 10 22_18h01_37  https   user images githubusercontent com 8697665 67306003 8d398500 f4f6 11e9 96d3 b9e3e859304f png  the single  hasmap node  is linked to 5 539 other nodes each of which has a list with over 17 000 entries as value  the contents of the map look somehow awkward as well  as you can see in the above screenshot the key  io netty handler traffic   is referenced by a path  c       project name  build libs bsh 2 0b6 jar   the strange thing is that the library  bsh 2 0b6 jar  is not copied to the project's build libs folder  the only jar in this folder is typically the   project name   version  jar  file  however there are thousands of these references for each project  perhaps this already provides some insights to you   if there is more i can provide  please let me know 
we have some teams that are publishing artifacts  native library symbols  using ivy format  we have created a gradle plugin which  by using additional configuration takes all dependencies from that configuration  in this case the ivy artifacts  and uploads them to various crash reporting systems 
it's a not a bug related to the jvm's cap on arguments  it's because a generated groovy internal class  introduced for  performance reasons   https   github com groovy groovy core blob groovy_2_4_3 src main org codehaus groovy runtime arrayutil java#l18 l51   chose 250 arguments as the maximum for their utility methods   see javadocs posted in issue   this was a  known issue  https   user gradle codehaus narkive com t7dqjoxd the maximum number of directories in a multi project envriontment  for almost a decade  so i'm skeptical groovy will alter this file that's likely being kept for backwards compatibility reasons  i filed this ticket as a feature request to simply provide an alternative approach of passing multiple arguments to  include  not involving arrays  this way  the work arounds involve a _tad_ less hoop jumping like explicitly defining an array type and having to spread it 
## afaik that one  sent from my android phone with k 9 mail  please excuse my brevity  behlendorf reply reply github com wrote  that's not good  however  i would have expected atop to read these stats from  proc  pid  io which is updated properly on my machines for zfs  do you know what interface it's using to access these stats  ## reply to this email directly or view it on github  https   github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 313#issuecomment 1535487
i did not know that gdb command  future lundman thanks you   arc c is the one file that i have not touched  but added maybe 2 calls that call into it 
that was the clean sources  just git cloned  i was running it as this   pre    configure   prefix  usr   sysconfdir  etc   libexecdir  usr lib   with spl      spl build make   pre 
hi ned  i also found that whamcloud's git repo had added this kernel patch several days ago  if this patch is missing  when building ldiskfs  errors are "iopen" related  for example   root vnode170   lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 # make make all recursive make 1   entering directory   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2' making all in ldiskfs make 2   entering directory  root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs' make  c  lib modules 2 6 32 source  subdirs  pwd  modules make 3   entering directory   root linux 2 6 32 71 el6' cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs balloc o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs bitmap o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs dir o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs file o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs fsync o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs ialloc o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs inode o cc  m   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen o  root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen c  in function 'iopen_lookup'   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen c 118  error  implicit declaration of function 'd_rehash_cond'  root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen c  in function 'iopen_connect_dentry'   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen c 167  error  implicit declaration of function 'd_move_locked' make 4         root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs    ldiskfs iopen o  error 1 make 3        _module_ root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs  error 2 make 3   leaving directory  root linux 2 6 32 71 el6' make 2         modules  error 2 make 2   leaving directory   root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2 ldiskfs' make 1        all recursive  error 1 make 1   leaving directory  root lustre ldiskfs 3 1 4 2' make        all  error 2
what else can i give you to help troubleshoot  version is latest on launchpad net  version 0 6 0 9  this has happened a few times resulting in a forced reboot  the system stalls at releasing weak file systems  which i assume is a result of this   i originally had this pool on a sil3214 but zfs started telling me there was file corruption  after a ton of hardware troubleshooting it turned out to be the card  the pool is no longer attached to the card and corruption issues have not come back up  now this error keeps popping up but only when moving a large amount of data +1gb  the pool is connected via a port multiplier but this error showed up before i installed that  the system has 8gb of ram zfs tends to take 5gb of that  all of the drives have passed long and short smart tests  i even updated the drives firmware  i am preforming another copy right now i will let you know if it fails again  if there are any other logs or such i can supply just let me know 
ya    connfigure   sysconfdir  etc i found the init scripts only run from  etc init d and not any other prefix

thanks  it works
hi brian  thanks for your reply  using kernel 5 6 2 i get  and stuff  which is probably already fixed by 2c3a83701dd185cadb30db4556256534e2930c7d  i wanted to try out a "nightly" zfs dkms but i guess i can use the sources as well or wait for the next stable release  was just wondering why accessing the testing repository failed 
yes  i can compile it just fine  my problem is that it does not seem to generate the zfs kernel module  for the record  it does generate the other modules  like zcommon ko or zunicode ko  i'm currently grepping around the source tree  specifically the module directory  but i haven't found anything of interest yet 
 fransurbo thank you  regenerating the configure script helped  so i am on 2c33b91 now  closing the issue then 
debian testing  checkout of kernel was fresh  zfsonlinux was reused  but i made make clean   make distclean  for both spl and zfs  using instructions from readme  i just checked with fresh linux 3 8 kernel  and  spl zfs  0 6 0 rc14   and it fails to build with different error  something with nont finding a function symbol  cmpxchg_    not relevant to this issue  probably removed from 3 8 0  so  then i checked again  now with fresh linux 3 8 kernel  and spl git  zfs git d9b0ebbe824469d178a05b0fb9004e4afce86009  and end with  i do not have problem compiling outside of kernel tree 
exactly  i sat there for a half hour or so waiting for it to complete with no progress  will do  however it may be a few days until i can actually try this due to school 
unfortunately 
 rincebrain e6b760dd7 is just a local branch with some comments which does'nt differ from master  this was an old pool which was created near the landing of encryption  i could send the containt to a fresh one and drop it 
sorry for being late  here's the size of my  bin  du  sh  bin 120m  bin df  h filesystem size used avail use  mounted on  dev zd16p1 289m 168k 274m 1   tmp pristine part1  dev zd0p1 289m 152m 123m 56   tmp fish part1  dev zd32p1 289m 152m 123m 56   tmp clone part1 obviously not  zpool list name size alloc free cap dedup health altroot tank 1000m 632m 368m 63  1 00x online   also seems to have space left  when modifying the setup script for the zpool  lo raidz2 sh  to use 512m instead of 256m for each of the four loopback devices the test succeeds 
noop   the drop_caches blocks    
again  i cannot make much of this log  that is why i attach today's  there were seven concurrent rsync processes  they had been running for some hours before this showed up  the weird thing is  they seem to be still running  so i don't know how bad these messages are  jun 17 01 23 10 debian kernel   216248 504003  info  task backuppc_dump 21672 blocked for more than 120 seconds  jun 17 01 23 10

i'm on the road and the system in question is in another city  i will take a look in a day or two when i am with the machine again and try to get the log copied here 
 b333z    kpande thanks for the suggestion   gotta see if clone offers enough flexibility to do it easily   
thanks dehacked  yeah i considered that option  but that still means that the kernel will be tainted  etc  i would like to load the modules only when the box is running zfs  i'll keep that as a last resort  cheers
the above lines were ultimately it  i was testing the limitations of vdevs   zvols and playing around with zpools 
 ryao thank you for the response  here is the info you requested   zol version   0 6 3 linux distro   centos 6 3 linux kernel   2 6 32 279 el6 x86_64 i am willing to help with the patch  i just need more insight on to what in send or recv may be the bottleneck  i have done a lot of investigation on this and possible problems could be   1  zil 2  inflight io size
i agree with you but i just want to remove a old disk and insert new disk in the same slot and recreate a zpool without reboot 
hi dasjoe  squidward # od  c  etc hostid 0000000  0  0  0  0 0000004 so yes  and it's null  for ease i used  update initramfs  k all  c now to reboot   i must post this now  result in next post

0 6 4 in order to reproduce it you need to somehow make the "zfs create  p poola a " command from stage 1 to fail because of a failure in mount  lib libzfs libzfs_mount c 472  in our system we create a very large amount of datasets  so occasionally the mount actually fails 
hey  ahrens  so i think that there's some issue with the presentation in the ui and the documentation in the manpage  which lead to my interpretation that the number for _free_ in  zpool  and the number for _avail_ in  zfs  means the same thing  the man page currently states  _free_ by  zpool  means     or   we change the documentation as proposed  leave the free value as it was before and add the additional rows on  zpool get all  pool   which shows exactly what's substracted for which purpose from the free value 
 behlendorf yes i have     declare_event_class   is available    #define have_declare_event_class 1 in my zfs_config h i try to build zen kernel 4 3 master branch on ubuntu 16 04  development branch  and debian stratch sid gcc 5 2 3 but this is deja vu from prevous releases zol and this issue you may see in users discussions on different forums of internetland   early from arch   gentoo users now and on debian derivatives 
unfortunately  i didn't have the time to investigate the failures  if i had  i would have submitted a pull request to fix them  if i get some time in january  i'll look into them then  on 12 04 2015 04 54 pm  brian behlendorf wrote 
nope it's not the drive since i have similar hangs on multiple servers  i managed to initiate a crashdump on such a server and will go dig through it to try and find more concrete information

 d4rk4 could you elaborate what you mean  this server runs only zfs and nfs  it's not running the vm's itself  only storage for the virtual disks  in the past we had similar problems with the older version  see this issue created by an colleague then    https   github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 3445  same system 
good point  didn t mind that  the resilver was automatically started after boot  so chances are high that there was a backward jump in time  will check for that
 dweeezil   i am not sure why there are multiple receive processes were triggered on the same dataset   may be i have tried multiple migrations as the lxc container wasn't transmitted successfully  and also the process state of zfs is being set to d  uninterruptible sleep  which in the normal case should be in s waiting for the data to receive on the network  
the pool was created some years ago and had been used since then  i periodically updated to the latest stable kernel and git master branch of zfs spl  at least  it could be imported by kernel 4 8 15 and zfs c4434877ae449a637d0f302eca80fcaad354874f   i'm going back to this version for the time being  
thanks  it looks good now
according to zfs 8   only posix acl is currently supported by zol  and it is completely separated from the nfsv4 acl in zfs internally 
the values i am showing here are all kernel 4 19  i have a few numbers for kernel 5 0 which basically confirm the numbers from kernel 4 19  no significant difference by kernel version  but the zfs version makes a big difference  write iops is down to 70   with zfs 0 8  average write iops 249 with zfs version 0 7 13 and 175 with version 0 8

 fling   details   summary pool features  summary     details  i did turn the new  autotrim  option on initially  as this is on an ssd  then turned it off once the issue became apparent  all of the subsequent tracking down has been done with  autotrim off  
 aerusso your work is greatly appreciated  i'll contact the devuan team to see if they can build and test that package  i set up vms to test some of the packages that devuan was building but not much has been done for the last few months  opening this request was just trying to get the ball rolling  it looks like you have already been pushing that ball uphill already  another thought when opening this request was to eventually have devuan use the zol source instead of using the debian source  yea  i see your points  it seems more and more that a zol release should not just "include" the debian folder  seems like a better thing to do is for zol to make their own apt source with their own debian based packages  then the debian official packages could be just not be used  the rpm  deb packaging seems like just a ugly hack  hence  why i started this request  in the end i was hoping to see either a debian folder in the zol source and perhaps an zol apt repository

the server is a backup server for various machines  with the oldest snapshots being from 2008  so yes  it is very likely that those snapshots are from an older pool version  i have just recently upgraded from 0 6 5 9 to 0 7 12

syslog says reason is that zfs module is not loaded  and i can load the module  then manually start the services  so the only issue is the install fails because the modules are not loaded   and then loading the modules at boot never occurs   it should be easy to reproduce by installing to a debian system with no previous zfs installation   i tried compiling from source and creating  deb installers for all the services and the same thing occurs
the server has 192gb ram  so i guess that is not the problem  high io might be a hit  i started the destruction of the snapshots  and captured the disk io with  zpool iostat  lq 1   this is not the complete output   zpool_iostat_during_snapshot_destruction log  https   github com zfsonlinux zfs files 3843125 zpool_iostat_during_snapshot_destruction log  hardwarewise this is a raidz1 with 6 disks  so this might actually be the maximum

 arshaw how complex would it be to complete this  0 5 scale with 5 being the most complex   looks like modifying  renderfill  is not the way to go as it's used for  businesshours  and events with  inverse background  rendering  i wonder if there is a way to tweak the  renderfgsegs  process to reuse witdth calculation logic but making the event translucent  click through   i've been two days studying the code for the first time  i think i could do it if properly hinted by you  this is crucial in a project where were are trying to represent schedule availability  in a concurrent fashion 
hi sorry for this  the select event is fired after a long press and i was not aware about this  v2 7 is awesome

well i tested this with chrome device toolbar  but clients say that calendar is not working with iphone 6 + mobile safari 10 on ios10  i can confirm that new version not working with my htc +  cm browser and chrome  and huawei ascend p6 + firefox  works on chrome   today we find out  that on all browsers it works  if press on event a longer time  but problem is  that after release it selects some random event 
windows 10  newest firefox 
i just want to use scss version for maintainability and for usage in applications that use scss
https   codesandbox io s 0p78k93q40   in this demo  i'm trying to set id after dragging an external event to the calendar  same problem
we are trying to implement the functionality here https   www youtube com watch v jtw6lf0sd1y
using "select" you can choose any amount of days hours  is it possible to limit the selection to just a day like dayclick  or disable the dragging effect  
yes  the dow   function repeat the events every but i will not show events with dow function on holidays
hi acerix  it's a problem for me  look there's an event start from 2018 02 01 13 00 to 2018 02 05 16 00  so the start time  started form 13 00 2018 02 01 and end in 16 00 2018 02 05  i need start   end times display day by day   not for all the period  example  in this days 2018 02 01 time  start form 13 00 to 16 00  and the next day the same start from 13 00 to 16 00  it's clear now  
sorry  maybe i was not specific enough  i updated the codepen with a mock for a loader we use  it's  show  and  hide  methods simply log to the codepen's console and fade in out a div  since we use  setinterval  to call periodically  removeeventsources  and  addeventsource   we should periodically see  loader show    and  loader hide    called in the console  however  the logging  and therefore the call to the methods  stops after the second call to  loader show     while the interval is still running  can be seen via the  console log 'interval'    calle periodically   this means that the  loading  callback is fired twice  but  eventafterallrender  only once  which is problematic
hi acerix  the calendar is part of a large outsystems application  stripping it to the core and still keeping a working page is not doable  but i have saved the page as a stand alone set  attached  which is showing what goes wrong  if you activate planboard html  goes to the day view and drag it a little down  you will see the nowindicator stops somewhat half way   planboard zip  https   github com fullcalendar fullcalendar files 2306249 planboard zip 
thank your for looking at this  i made a short video and you can see what i'm trying to say do  https   drive google com file d 1ahvydcwaqodxlbhevgczzrpuppu8r3je view i'm looking to have event creation like in the first part of the video   1 click  release  the just move the mouse and you have the selection like a hover effect  click again for end date time  i got this behavior by mistake   having a bug in my code  if i remove that bug  or just remove the code in the dayclick function i get a different behavior  on click a event equal with 1 slot is created  on second click the initial even is cleared and a new one is placed in the new spot  thank you
you can see it here  https   codepen io mbilal92 pen ponweg
https   codepen io anon pen gbjrar editors 1111 so eventreceive and eventleave fires  while drop does not  so i dont have the information where i dropped the event i was dragging  therefore i cannot replace his date and time in the database  this is when you drag events from one calendar to another  doesnt matter weather its weekly  day or month view  also external elements which is not included in demo works  and if you drag'n drop external button or some other element and drop it into calendar  drop event fires and i have info logged into console  only drop includes date of where the event was dropped and i'm not having it fired   acerix
https   codepen io paweli pen mqvoml this is my example  when i click an event  i fire eventclick method in which i received date object  unfortunately in date object  there is no value that tells which hour i clicked on  if i click in the middle of the event  i'd like to get information that i click on 8 30  one of my ideas to get that info is to fire dayclick method  which would return the expected value 
got it  thanks  👍

i think returning the right content type is definitively the right thing to do   especially for an api  debugging should still be trivial by using the right tools  and will even benefit by being able to actually interpret the responses as json  chrome  f ex  will show a structured representation of the json response if the content type is application json  but will just show the raw text otherwise    consumers of the api might also chose to process the response differently based on the content type  my project  http   www webpop com  offers an http client as part of its extension engine that will automatically parse the response body from an http request that returns application json  i've seen other wrappers around restful services take a similar aproach

inline comments  i have no idea how to write them in coffeescript syntax 
compiled js would likely look something like this for the first example 
while the value might be meaningful  it's not particularly useful  as far as i can tell from the docs  it basically does the same thing as the  own  operator  whereas i would argue that the idiom of   is fairly common 
well  for example  i want to copy paste something from a web   notepad  i can do this in python  ruby  node but i can't do it in coffeescript 
it is not the same  if you're using a more complex abc function   but you're true  when abc is only return  3  it's the same  i apologize for my bad example 
jsonp client libraries like google's feed api and jquery's   getjson   need to pass the callback function in a url  the url of the script   which means they have to represent the function as a string  not a pointer reference  so in the above example  there will eventually be a dynamically created script tag calling a global init   function  which of course doesn't exist as our init   is inside a closure  now you could make init   global with a window init   declaration  but  a  i tried it with the google feed api and for some reason  it doesn't work   b  you can't always do it  because with many jsonp client libraries  the callback function is dynamically generated with a random name  in regular coffeescript  this name will normally be trapped inside the closure  so the jsonp call will fail 
i had a feeling that was too trivial of a problem to not have been addressed already  whoops   
hi michael  the code i wrote does what i want  it declares the variables and set's their respective values  as it is now  i'd have to do it like this   maybe this functionality is already implemented   i just couldn't find a way to do it  i hope that's a better explanation    
 geoffreybooth i am using 1 9 3 but this is also applies to  try coffeescript  section on the site  i assume there is the latest version 
thank you  epidemian didn't know that worked  +1  edit  and this   also works   does something else  switch value for value in array

i'd expect it to be the second  but yeah  i can see why i would end up with the first one  but either ways  why does the code not compile 
you're right  fixed in master  thanks
first time i got this error during   coffee  c script coffee   compilation  now  somehow i understand why repl do not like this  but compiler do the same thing randomly  example  real part of code where it happens 
hmm  ok  true     it might break existing code    though only if the person having coded would actually really code something crazy    like relying on a not perfectly understandable syntax  quirk      in my case it boils down to staying mathematically logical  i simply can't use the     operator  i would have to bend my logic to something i believe to be a bit     unique     a think i really try to avoid and rarely  no  never  if possible at all  do  even jquery says goodbye to ie6 8  well  anyway  i see your point  though in my impression a bit unflexible and certainly not that adventurous courageous  if you want to walk the path of compatibility and still evolve  why not make your own suggestion a possiblity truth  i think to add an exclam mark is real funky     like myvar myfunc         that would simply return true instead of void if there is no myfunc     call it the "force" operator cheers  thx
error of mine  i paste the wrong app coffee  thinking it was a global bug i had something like this in an other app coffee file    which now compiles to app use express session     instead of app use express session      so you're right  it's a duplicate of #2715 
because the tooling for javascript surpasses the tooling for coffeescript  we use a combination of coffeelint and jshint for this reason  that said  i don't think our choice of linting tools is entirely relevant  coffeescript already omits the  break  statement if the  when  block contains a  return  statement  so it should similarly omit it if there is a  throw  statement 
ah  i didn't notice an issue for this already exists  sorry for that  i tried to test the source you fixed  but it throws an error in another part of the program when running   uncaught referenceerror  module is not defined  build command i used   export minify false  cake build browser 
i didn't realize it when i submitted this issue  but there is actually  some   limited backslash escape sequence support in single quoted ruby strings  per http   en wikibooks org wiki ruby_programming strings#single_quotes  so  'a n'    'a n' for example  on thu  jun 13  2013 at 11 38 am  nami doc notifications github com wrote 
it is going to take some years to be outdated so i don't think it's meaningless and neither does the v8 and node js team  because it is the only way to test forward the advance in javascript  after all  after the es6 spec is finished  there will be also  es7 and es8  http   www 2ality com 2011 09 es6 8 html  
i was working with promises and tests  it was something like this 
i hope you are not trying to be funny  that we would be pretty sad   it is still a question  please give me your best answer  void is used in many great languages  and i am pretty sure i am not the only one who likes it more than undefined  if void freakes you out so much  please let us at least know why 
okay  well i figured it out  and there's no need to dwell on the issue  perhaps it's more productive to figure out if this is clearly described in the language guide  but i guess it's just as easy to look at the generated code 
#2992 is just a question about if this is intended also #2992 doesn't discuss if it should be implemented to me it seems like the current behavior of returning  undefined  exists only because nobody ever thought about what the behavior should be and hence the same _compilation_ as outside of strings interpolation is applied
 geoffreybooth i think babel transpiling only makes things worse  i just tried  transpile  presets   ' babel env'   on the simple example  and got  evalmachine  anonymous  5   was 3 without transpile  expected behavior is 1   babel has a mode where it tries to preserve line numbers  which would probably bump it back to 3 
we use a dependency injection system which parses the output of the constructor to know what modules to inject  a bit like angularjs did   this can't find a module with a 1 at the end 
i think you just cleared up all my confusion and i think i can keep the pr small  i should have something in an hour or so  fingers crossed  
apologies  it's my first time using coffeescript  i will paste unaltered code from here  here is the full output   it would properly compile in babel  no

thanks for you replies  client is python  redis py   will validate connections are active 
so  i placed it here  https   github com antirez redis doc issues 233 but i cannot fix it because i am new to redis and it seems that it needs check the text around by some expert  hashes mean data structure change definitely   and second  i am not native english speaker 
i think maybe i known the reason now  because the client and server need request response proccess  some waiting between them may be more serious between tow machines 
i use zend framework  so i need this version  is here anyway to solve the problem 
sigterm was sent after crush itself  so maybe it's not a reason  can't really run redis under gdb in production  but maybe will if have same crush again  thx for fast reply

 itamarhaber you are right  with  unstable  it works   charsyam actually  set key ex 10 nx  is not a bad syntax 
i think there are times when it's too many information  and we can not narrow down information of each section using by another command like grep 
sorry how can i check the removing save option

sorry  the log file is missing i have change code  so call stack does not match the version 3 2 8  the reason is the representclusternodeflags does not handle cluster_node_migrate_to

the issue  the latest version of script celeryd fails with "start stop daemon  invalid option    'f'"  was found under ubuntu  9 10   earlier version of celeryd doesn't warns if manage py is not executable  the latest version does warn  but the latest version of celeryd is not ubuntu 9 10 compatible 
yeah  i guess i was rambling a bit in this one 
in my case it was because celery was not loading the settings py correctly  we had a project that started on django 0 9 or something  edit  the people on the irc channel were very helpful in debugging it and i think we ultimately added the issue to the documentation 
if that's how init scripts always work  then it isn't a bug  my manage py wasn't executable for some reason  i just tried django admin py startproject  and the file is created with +x by default  maybe i lost it through some vcs mishap  i suspect that many people using celery won't be that familiar with init configuration  so it may be worth adding a note to the docs 
i don't know   maybe store utc time stamp  see utcnow    instead of the local one  afaik utc aka gmt doesn't use daylight changes 
i haven't thought too deepely  some ideas  1  don't do it at the amqp layer  do it above  so that celeryd just puts back a message whose version it cant handle 2  make amqp calls directly  like chan queue_declare queue "celery_ s"   version       i'm not an amqp expert  so maybe this should be done with exchanges and routing keys  3  make the user pre create the queues  more generally  my problem is that when i have a version mismatch  the old messages seem to cause exceptions in celery  then it holds on to them  so  the queue stop processing new messages  instead of versioning  maybe my issue would be solved if celery somehow stashed 'unprocessable' messages on another queue so we could debug them

i can tell you  but  the odd thing is  this code path _was_ executed at least once before without throwing an exception      having said that     take a look at http   github com rackspace python cloudfiles tree  the code had called container get_objects    which returned a list  previousobject was set to some member of the list  i e

unfortunately  i don't know too much about linux vserver  although i do believe that the virtual images run inside a chroot  or a variation of it  the reason why i opened this issue was to see if it was possible to use celery in this environment  is the taskpool something that i can use  or is it only experimental  i couldn't find too much information on it 
exactly  currently you have to grep logs on the worker server in question if the task fails and the exception alone is not enough to pinpoint the issue 
thanks for your quick response  i am now using the master branches as you suggested  but i still get the same error  if it helps  i was able to fix it  in a hackish way that works for now   this is in file  kombu pidbox py   line 75  the line  reply_to   dict  str k  v  for k v in reply_to iteritems     is the only addition

no  it's different than #4661   that relates specifically to retries in eager mode  this situation happens with any retries within a task that uses the autoretry_for functionality

what do you mean by "build these"  i _think_ what you want is to download the package source  rename tmpxxxx py to setup py and then run "python setup py install" 
 ask i did  i just needed to move the djcelery to the top of the installed_apps in django settings

 auvipy i created a pull request 
using amqp  rabbitmq   here is the output of the above command 
the retry logic should be implemented the same way it is in celery_always_eager  if it is   just return none recursively for all request context items i'd say  how are those currently handled in celery_always_eager 
never installed rc
that's a great idea  i never though of that  i'll try that out and post back here  thanks 
 ask
 ionelmc we don't have  acks_late  set as well 
i'm calling it via  asyncresult get timeout 1    it looks like it's possible for  drain_events  to be called many times from the  while 1  loop  and the timeout will not decrease with each time round the loop 
of course  here are the details  if you need more information  let me know  celery report   rabbitmq  "3 1 3" result backend  rpc only one registered task  btw  there is only one process consuming the whole cpu  maybe it's the celery management process 
unfortunately that's all we get   the purpose of this signal handler is to add exception tracebacks to celery logs  as we don't get them otherwise  we're using graylog  but that's just a standard handler so shouldn't affect this  strangely  it works in my local dev environment but this showed up as soon as we deployed to production  if you have any ideas about what might be causing it that would be a great help 
because python 3 4 is where i saw the bug  and i rather presume that it only occurs under python 3 and not python 2  because otherwise my bug report would be "celery does not work"  which  if true  would be somewhat surprising that nobody had already noticed 
celery  3 1 11 django celery  3 1 10 django celery with redis  3 0 i am running the celery via  manage py celery worker  if it matter 
i'll try to set up a test case now   
not a useful one at this time  i'll try to create a small demo project
i expect celery events to record time when celery worker gets a request  when i modified the celery_timezone "asia calcutta"  it doesnt logs the actual time of asia calcutta when it gets an request  since celery depends on pytz library for its time setting  i expect it to return the time for culcutta region  but it returns some other timezone time  is there anyway to debug it

this is obviously a bit artificial  just trying to set it up   this will work fine and execute the  denormalise_foos    and  denormalise_bars    tasks when run with the redis backend  however  if you set  task_always_eager   true   then it will fail in  spawn_denormalisation_tasks  with  valueerror  current task is not member of any chord

 auvipy i think unicode error is a false error  it happens after the oom killer has sent a kill  9 to the process  so i think not worth looking at  but a and b bugs from above maybe   
 georgepsarakis   precisely 
this is librabbitmq specific as the original post says  and it says why too    
it is feature request  nothing is wrong with celery  except for lack of this feature 
celerytasks py  app   celery   def method1 a  b   print "add    and   " format a b   def method2 a  b   return a b  app task def fun a  b   method1 a   b  methode2 a  b  test_celery_task py  from unitest mock import patch class mockedfuntion  def mock_method1 a  b   print "mult    and   " format a b   class testclass   patch "celerytasks method1"  new mockedfunction mock_method1  def test_task celery_app  celery_worker   task   fun delay 5  4  res task get   assert res result    20 when the task will be extcuted by celey_worker  the original method1 will be excuted instead of the mock_method1  i'm using the mock outside the celery context and it works fine  i guess that the worker cannot see the mocked functions  
hi auvipy  thanks for this response  if i use the latest celery package version 4 2 1 i and kombu version 4 2 1 i get following error from kombu utils compat import ordereddict # noqa importerror  cannot import name 'ordereddict' from 'kombu utils compat' i am unable to solve the importerror and kombu is required by celery hence i have downgraded to celery 3 1 26 and kombu 3 0 37 how do i proceed 
it is solved in 4 2 1 
 auvipy  let's assume that this " generate report" endpoint is called when the "generate" button  i was trying to think up a way for a single task to be enqueued even if the user pressed the button twice  or perhaps a network retry is performed in some middleware or proxy   reading it again  i think i misunderstood the  sqs documentation on the matter  https   docs aws amazon com awssimplequeueservice latest sqsdeveloperguide using messagededuplicationid property html   sqs fifo queues already perform deduping based on the content  i e  if the content is exactly the same  the queue will dedup  within a 5 minute window  without having to provide any kind of  messagededuplicationid  out of band   of course  if celery's sqs backend puts e g  the current time into the sqs message  then each message will be considered unique if we don't pass an explicit  messagededuplicationid   but i didn't look into celery's internals  
the pidfile is not owned by a different user  the problem is that the code assumes kill   will set errno to esrch if the process does not exist but that only works if it is running as root  for a non privileged user  kill   sometimes sets errno to eperm if there is no such process 
do you mean a fix for this issue 
sure  i'll do that
yes  i did try it from master  actually  i have a question for the source code in the file  celery canvas signature#__or__   maybe the comment  # group     group      single group  is not right   chain group1  group2   is not the same as  group group1  group2   
yes  looks like it works better now

 nashby here is sample application  see branch  oauth devise   https   github com maro10 devise_oauth  thx  w o api_key  api_secret 
according to the code deprecation messages should show up by checking a certain setting value  " devise  devise case_insensitive_keys is false   "    when it is set to    email   " devise  devise use_salt_as_remember_token is false "    when it is true " devise  devise reset_password_within is nil"    when it is set to 24 hours so my settings are not the one checked in the devise code and deprecation messages 
i believe it's happening because after requesting   resque  as unauthenticated for the first time  the subsequential redirect is being done to  " resque admins sign_in"  while it should be  " admins sign_in"  basically the unauthenticated redirect url is being prepended with the mount point name  i have no idea why it's going to   unauthenticated   in order to reproduce this specific issue i believe it might be enough to include

your patch got me one step further  but there were more missing constants  so what i did was  add require 'devise schema' to orm active_record rb also add require 'devise mapping' require 'devise controllers filters' require 'devise controllers url_helpers' to rails routes rb after that  script server was no longer complaining and rake db migrate was running as well  not sure this is the right way to do it  but it worked for me so far  i just wonder why not anyone else seems to experience this 
i find it  it hapens when  devisemailer sender   "no reply yourapp com"  is defined in environments development rb where i should write it 
  script console loading development environment  rails 2 3 5  see http   gist github com 271970 for 'config initializers devise rb'
i created the custom views with "rails generate devise_views"  when i start the server and go to users sign_up  then change this view and hit refesh  the old view is shown  only after a server restart i can see the updated view  it seems like at the first hit the view is cached as rails templates in production mode 
i'd say there's no reason to disable validations except that they have a slight performance hit  in our case  conditionally disabling validations makes orm agnosticism difficult because we need to support two pathways to persist data per orm module  with validations and without  unless the performance hit caused by validations is significant  i'd suggest always saving with just save   
thanks for looking at it  a couple notes  i'm doing some craziness with the routes  mapping anything missing to pages#show  its a pretty dynamic cms   i thought maybe my namespace or routes were messing with it  so i tried removing everything but root  to and the devise_for line but still had no success  i also know that you guys dropped support for mongo_mapper  so i just used the devise orm mongo_mapper from the version prior to master  it is actually working fine  creating passwords correctly etc   here are my routes and gemfile http   pastie org 915871 here is the output from 'rake routes' http   pastie org 915878

sorry  yea  figured this a few days back  after looking at the code with a fresh mind  i saw you were referencing controller_name in the set_flash_   method  and i had overriden this as a short term work round due to exception_notifier breaking about 2 months ago 
i created a smaller application on github  http   github com juanmcuello http request authenticate user the readme file gives some instructions  let me know if you need anything else 
for example when i use google_apps strategy i get following differences in callback urls omniauth 0 1 6  users auth google_apps callback openid ns      omniauth master  users auth google_apps callback _method post openid ns      so rails tries to find route  users auth google_apps callback with method post  but devise_for generates only with method get 
sorry  but i don't know how to write a failing test case  can i send you a smaller rails3 application 
i'd like to redirect user to my custom page  welcome index   on login failure  this is on the wiki  how to  redirect to a specific page when the user can not be authenticated
thanks for following up  the flash error message displayed says "invalid email or password " this is true for plataformatec's devse_example application for both the admin and user accounts created automatically by rake devise setup  as well as additional accounts created through the web application itself  confirm_within was unset  i tried setting it to 2 days  restarted   re raked the devise_example app but there was no change in behavior  i have been unable to get any mail to send successfully from devise so that might be a related issue if confirmation was required by devise_example  is there any way to get more information as to what's failing  i can add some logging statements  etc  the development log was not very informative w r t  troubleshooting this problem  thanks  mattpaul

hi  what do you mean by "in a smaller application"  i actually did test it on a simple application created using just rails and then devise without other classes  this m  user example is indeed as small as it gets to illustrate the problem  as for "reproducing the bug without devise"  hmm    i do know that once i comment out "devise_for  users" in routes db  at least "rails server" and "rails c" would start without problem  of course  i don't get the default routes   what i can do next is to manually code in the route mappings while leaving "devise_for  users" commented out to see whether this problem would still occur  will update later  thanks 
okay  finally got around doing it    
i agree  that having callbacks for all possible methods would be a pain  however it would be nice to have some official public api for developers  currently we can always hack and overwrite devise methods  but there is a problem that something can be broken in future releases  so we must maintain our code with devise changes more carefully 
actually this bug only occurs for me because i've patched devise to not scope routes to resource names  i wanted plain routes 'new_session' rather than 'new_user_session'  in so doing  i likely bypassed code where you convert the route name to a string  i'd like to do a real patch that allows non scoped routes  when i have the time  this can probably be ignored for now for people not hacking devise as i have 
meant to that the above comment with this account 
i'd be glad to patch this  but i'm not sure it's that simple  you can add  code     record class stateless_token  code  to line 9 to get this behavior  but then timeoutable is effectively disabled for all requests when stateless_token   true  not just requests using token authentication  is there a way i can check if token_authenticable was used for auth 
i can connect to the database fine    in the app itself it displays the last error that postgres encounters    and i did not have this problem running tests in my app until i installed devise 
i just reedited my ticket  i hope now is more understandable 
just sent a pull req  thanks for your quick answer  https   github com plataformatec devise pull 981
clone this application to see if you get the same errors https   github com ciopte7 want freight  production 
ok  in routes rb # root  to    "welcome    memory over root  to    "welcome    it's right  no problem point is  root_path exists or not rvm  ruby 1 9 2 p180 rails 3 1 0 rc1
yeah  just realized that after i posted the link  do you just want to be able to set it straight forward on the proxy  i'm still getting familiar with the warden api so i don't necessarily know if the proxy is immediately accessible to be set on  etc  i wonder if it makes sense as a per strategy thing  too  i'd be happy to throw together a patch for warden  just looking for some more input from anyone with more familiarity 
but if you want to know what dependecies i have on my computer i can get them to you in a couple of hours  just let me know where to look 
ok  i'm doing it 
threw in an edit  hope that works   
i just wanted to know if there's a way i can customize the json response for get  users sign_in  
solved  ilan on oct 9  2011  at 11 51 am  josé valimreply reply github com wrote 
on a hunch  i reinstalled 1 9 3 p0 and gems under rvm  that fixed the csrf warning and fixed the missing current_user  sorry about that 
thank you for your help  but i figured out this problem now by add "devise_for  members"  the code in wiki mislead people sometimes

thank you for the quick response  the routes are in the app   i'm getting http   localhost 3000   forum   users auth facebook while it should be http   localhost 3000 users auth facebook  without 'forum'  
forgot to mention i have multiple models  here i created a test app https   github com jtomasrl embedded model
i was using the version right before 2 1 1  2 1 0 i guess   and i've updated rails too  3 2 3 to 3 2 6 
thnks guys  beat me to it 
thanks for the reply jose  yep  documentation should be updated then 
sure   i solved the problem by updating devise from 1 5 to 1 5 3 
 josevalim  i've tested this in another machine  and it works fine  i think the problem is my enviroment 
im running two apps at the moment and both have the problem  i just set up a very fresh one and that doesnt have it  so its fine  i'll close it  thank you anyway
hm i can't seem to replicate it in a new app  will keep trying   but i've isolated the problem to that it's occurring only when accessed from a mobile  ios  app  it works fine when i log in through the web page for  users sign_in  but if i do a post from my mobile app the problem happens  here's the log for it   _homecontroller has  before_filter  authenticate_user  _ as mentioned it works fine when using devise 2 0
thanks  using a user resource worked 
hi josé  thanks a lot for looking into this so quickly  i've tested with a sample app  without being able to reproduce the issue either  i comparatively checked what my app was doing against the sample one  and i discovered the difference  my app's request was logging this   i could track the cause of this difference to a rack middleware of mine  in this  gist  https   gist github com 2590040 93cb2faca1ba5ead73222e74ca11790e3efb22de   which i added some time ago for an older version of rails which was having issues with the googlebot's accept header  without it  the request logs  as html  and devise correctly performs the redirection on sign out  i'm disabling my middleware hoping the issue is not present in rails 3 2 11 anymore  i think this closes the issue    thanks again  cheers  romain
super busy in the up and coming  but if you're not in any rush  i'll see what i can do 
greetings josé  i've attached a very simple rails devise app demonstrating my problem  in my app  and this example  the user requires four parameters for authentication  org_id  term_id  id  and password  the first two  org_id and term_id  identify the user's organization and the terminal they are logging in from  while the other two identify and verify the identity of the user  in the example  any values for the four parameters should be accepted  in my app  authentication with the remote server occurs on each request  since i cannot keep the remote session open  the remote server is very legacy and very paranoid   as a result  i need to keep the user's credentials in the rails session  which i recognize isn't very secure  but there you go  anyway  as it stands  the app will not work because in the gemfile  i've fixed the devise version to 2 2 4  if you change the devise version to 2 2 3 you will be able to log in  please let me know if you need anything else  peter  date  tue  28 may 2013 18 08 48  0700 from  notifications github com to  devise noreply github com cc  spierepf hotmail com subject  re   devise  2 2 4 is calling to_key on my model class when it shouldn't   #2439  we need more information  it may as well be caused by storing data devise doesn't know how to deserialize from session  can you provide a failing app or a test case to devise suite  thanks  — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
i can't reproduce the issue today either  using my tests that were failing yesterday  my gems have been refreshed since then  though  thanks for the follow up and sorry for the false alarm 
this line in particular is causing the route problem in the omniauthcallbackscontroller function  e g  facebook   sign_in_and_redirect  user   event     authentication either i simply don't call the function  would that be fine    or i need to do something before that makes it work  i'm assuming the sign_in_and_redirect does more than just redirecting the url  maybe that's a wrong assumption 
absolutely  no worries here  just wanted to check if this isn't a bug  thanks for the hard work  and for getting back to me that quick  i'll close the issue    
 nashby i would love to  but it is closd source  and app is a little bit complex  so i cannot provide access to source code   1   i can provide only some small parts like routing 
you say it's an issue in the docs  and you closed the issue without it being solved     i'll see if i have time this weekend 
i think it is still an issue  i'll get back to you in a couple of days  when i re start social auth feature on project  i put this on hold because of that weird dependency bug 
thanks 
here is an rspec test   please note  i get the same response when using  curl  with  rails s 
the custom mailer is shown    it's called mydevisemailer  line 12 is   'reset_password_url'    edit_user_password_url reset_password_token  token   so token is the      error from what i'm gathering 
i'm not sure how to reproduce it manually i've tried  it's somewhere inside devise and only happens sometimes  has something to do with the session 
ok  i had a look at it  i tried it with an app as bare as possible  it runs fine with ruby 2 0 but crashes with ruby 1 9 3 
when we set  request formats     mobile   html   the renderer will then tries to find views that have   mobile erb   and if its not found  instead of raising an exception  it will try to find   html erb    in devise  this somehow got change  and the renderer will only search for   mobile erb    so in cases where the application is still in the process of migrating into mobile version  only some views have   mobile erb   the renderer will fails  
it's was  config allow_unconfirmed_access_for   0  but after changing it to  config allow_unconfirmed_access_for   0 days  did fix the deprecation warning  thanks for help  closing this issue 
it make sense     but i still don't like it     anyway thank you for your answer   
ah i see  sorry my bad  thanks solved now    
 devise  failureapp#i18n_message  https   github com plataformatec devise blob v3 3 0 lib devise failure_app rb#l73  and the methods that it calls  warden_message  i18n_options  scope   this is useful on its own in a custom failure app  i'm thinking a logical name for the module would be devise  failuremessage 
hi josé  thanks for your fast answer  i am using devise 3 4 1 and as far as i can see it  a fix should have been merged with this commit  https   github com plataformatec devise pull 3153  no  as far as i can see  the branch was merged on oct  3rd 2014  while 3 4 1 was released on oct  29 2014 
will do 
hmm  somehow it works now  is there any chance that using 11111111 as a password could cause an issue 
as far as i remember warden set the headers correctly  it's up to devise to bind up those headers to the final ones  thank you for the whole stuff  i hope that this will make devise better    il 19 apr 2016 4 46 pm  "ulisses almeida" notifications github com ha scritto 
it appears to only happen after a migration  i'm able to reproduce it when i create new migrations or i'm pulling in new work that requires i run migrations  i of course have to reset the server when i run migrations but the error appears to happen in that first run  it fixes itself after i reset the server again  it's all very confusing sorry 
 znz you are right  my mistake    
 tegon unfortunately  i can't provide a sample application  but i was able to solve my issue with manually serializing serializing the cookies    i had forgotten that they are signed when saved to the client 
i discovered the issue   and can't recall why it was there   but had attr_accessor for password  so it wasn't encrypting  a very random old search had pointed that out  all my tests were passing btw  which was weird  thanks 
looks like that's it  works if i use  before  or  before  each    thanks for the help  maybe make a note of that in the readme 
i'm using rails 5 2 nd on applying devise it raise an error for bcrypt_ext    after changing version of bcrypt    it arise for all for other project to   is devise compatible with rails 5 2 or not  
app i'm currently working on  gitrepo blocks  https   github com trendwithin blocks  i commented out the redirect so this will need to be uncommented before running   rails test test integration users user_sign_in_test rb  i have the system test commented out as well since it breaks so those will need to be removed before running  rails test test system users user_sign_in_test rb  i just ran the test again with byebug in order to confirm this with a screenshot from the browser   img width "1050" alt "screen shot 2019 07 16 at 11 06 55 am" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 8145031 61318977 1dab4f80 a7bb 11e9 9137 b4dd32835853 png"  i haven't seen any modification in the readme regarding fixtures so i've used the same as in my rails 5 projects  additionally  sign in and redirect work perfectly fine in dev 
fixed it by using  devise allow_unconfirmed_access_for  instead of  self allow_unconfirmed_access_for 
 headius with  eutf 8  jruby is able to generate the file test xml just fine under windows xp  no more conversion error  thank you 
no returned items 
thank you for fixing this issue  i'll try making a rubyspec   
the spaceship operator does appear to use compareto  for a solution  i went ahead and implemented equals on the classes that were giving me problems  which seems to be a better practice anyway   i was just surprised to see the behavior change 
looking into it  i think i agree with you that it's a bug in mri  i don't have an account on the ruby bug tracker  but i'll do some more testing  with 2 0 and 1 8 and the latest patchlevel  and report it 
that i'm not sure  i have a vague memory of verifying it in both directions  but here i have only reported the case of doing the test during dst  i can probably retest against the same version  and trunk  the next time i have access to the windows computer 
 wmeissner  party_foul  is using  thor  for a rails generator which itself will make use of   stdin gets  in the  ask_simply  method  https   github com wycats thor blob master lib thor shell basic rb#l373 other than that  party_foul  is not doing anything special 
 headius thank you for that  in return  i added the spec that you suggested  https   github com ruby spec pull 596  it works on mri but fails on jruby 9 1 16 0  haven't tested with jruby master  but running  rvm install jruby head  now so will check once it's done  
i am using
ah thank you  that solves the   help thing    gemfile   
just tested with ruby 1 9 3  and it works as expected  i'll check the return value as  headius asked  thanks for the feedback  
yes  the jdk successfully builds jruby but fails the testing  any ideas 
 headius no it did not work in jruby 9 1 17 0 i only got raspberry on wednesday so i am an absolute nooby apart from knowing my way around linux 
i fixed it  it hangs 
ok  thank you  it worked for me 
thanks for fixing this  purple_heart   i can try although i'm not too familiar with your ci  where in the project heirarchy should i place the dummy test project  is there another example of such a high level integration test 
from the viewpoint of functionality  if it is _just a warning_  it really is not a big deal  however  if you have   as in my case   a system consisting of plenty of  zsh  shell scripts  each calling lots of jruby programs  seeing all the warnings looks confusing and is not something i would like to hand over to my customer as professional work from my side   my customer might argue that i'm using a programming language implementation which is not done in a good way  since i not only want to get "my work done" somehow  but also demonstrate the pros of jruby  i certainly want to avoid this warning to pop up  a solution which i could do for myself  would be to write a wrapper script around jruby  which catches stderr and filters out exactly this warning  but since i'm likely not the only person seeing this warning  if it is difficult to fix the root cause  would it be possible to disable this warning by a command line switch  kind of     no warning stty       or maybe a switch to disable stty     nostty   if i could control this by an environment variable too  it would be even more convenient  kind of   jruby_options  
actually  the feature to have each string contain its own encoding  was introduced in cruby 1 9  see for instance http   nuclearsquid com writings ruby 1 9 encodings  and http   ruby doc org core 1 9 3 string html#method i encoding   i don't think that the bug is about using the wrong encoding internally   otherwise using i e  japanese characters in my string wouldn't work correctly    but that string#encoding does not return the correct information  it would be helpful to compare this with cruby 1 9 3  but i don't have one here  btw  i tried the same with jruby 9 0 4 0  also on windows  and got the same behaviour  but since we  unfortunately  have to work with jruby 1 7  i'm also interested in getting it fixed for this version 
sorry  it's my fault my default jruby version is 1 7 4  1 9 3p392  2013 05 16 2390d3b i switched to 9 0 4 0  and it's ok now  thanks 
i unpack a java jdk onto   usr lib jvm  from there i invoke   and so on    i also point  java_home  to my preferred jdk  e g      usr lib jvm jdk1 8 0_65 
apologies  but you'll have to go slower here  i did see the other issue  but i don't understanding what you mean and imho these are not the same  please correct if i am wrong  i extracted jruby complete and asciidoctorj jars to look for openssl and i only found the folder in jruby complete  so i understand there's no repackage done on asciidoctorj side  my test project has no other dependencies and only uses gems from these jars  when checking jruby complete 9 1 17 0  i see this the path  jruby complete 9 1 17 0 meta inf jruby home lib ruby stdlib jopenssl version rb   from that  i understand that jruby complete contains an old openssl version that has the issue  and that to fix asciidoctorj i have 3 options  1  use a new jruby complete 9 1 18 0 version    that i leave for you to decide whether it makes sense or not to release  2  adapt asciidoctorj to use 9 2 0 0 3  current workarround  install a newer version of the gem using gem maven gradle plugin and use a feature provided by asciidoctorj that allows to override the one in the jar    this is very cumbersome and not really a good solution users not familiar with ruby  the goal of asciidoctorj is to hide this details  am i wrong and the  version rb  i am seeing has nothing to do with the version 
thanks for fixing it  i confirm that it works 
nice work 
i guess actually what i really wanted was  socket unpack_sockaddr_in " x02 x00 x00p x7f x00 x00 x01 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00"   but it expects those first two bytes to be switched  the reason i'm trying to use that is that i'm reading in linux auditd logs and one of the fields is saddr which is in byte form  i would like to extract the port and ip so that i can search on it in elasticsearch  i was trying to transform the data in a logstash ruby filter using unpack_sockaddr_in and ran into this issue  so both sockaddr_in and unpack_sockaddr_in seem to want those first two bytes switched  but the incoming data matches the expected behavior of ruby  for right now i just flip the bytes in my filter and it works  but felt like this should behave similarly to ruby 
the reason is that cacerts's format is invalide it has nothing to do with jruby  i replace the cacerts in  java_home jre lib security to resolve the error
i looked at a dump the other day  and saw only one copy of the middlewarehealthcheck object  however  i ran more stress tests against mri ruby today  and was able to trigger an error on the 2'727th access  i ran the test twice  and got the same error at exactly the same point  given that i have succeeded in replicating the problem on mri ruby  i am closing the issue  thanks for your comments  i'll bear them in mind as i dig deeper into this 
alright  i'll work on trying to put together a bit of code that reproduces the error  might take me into next week  i didn't post until i'd pretty much exhausted google and cross tested every other alternative  stay tuned 
 prepend  is exactly the cause  looked a bit closer at the ancestors and found this   that anonymous module right before  arjdbc  sqlite3  triggers the problem  it's inserted by rails'  deprecate  and can be easily worked around  https   github com jruby activerecord jdbc adapter commit 39862741c2f1e58ff23b568b9e5c8d7b1cd0ed86
right you are    the new version of the jdk came with an update to solaris  there were old versions of bouncycastle in  usr java jre lib ext  perhaps left over from previous work i did  i was previously using a separately installed jdk and when i switched to the version bundled with solaris to get the new version of the jdk  these old jre lib ext jar files were now being found and used  causing this problem  thanks for the hint  and sorry to bother you 
i haven't tried it extensively  i just tried simple commands like reading the file  i tried reading the file with encoding "ms950" and "x windows 950" and it just gave me warning    warning  unsupported encoding x windows 950 ignored  may be we should do the same in jruby  instead of throwing exception  just use some default encoding  yes  it seems ms950 is a bit different but i couldn't find any details of the actual difference  i have the same opinion that it is close enough to alias  if we don't get the details on the encoding difference then probably we should add it as alias until someone comes up with the a problem with it  wdys 
sweet  thank you  christopher  for pointing that out  didn't noticed it at a first glance  and it would be more readable if there was ofsegment instead of two ofpoints    also   oflinesegmentintersection  http   openframeworks cc documentation math ofmath html# show_oflinesegmentintersection  function could be a method of an ofsegment instance  it doesn't really belongs to more general ofmath category if you think about it 
yea  i've debugged it  but the backtrace is not useful    the crash happens when  main  function is exited  out of scope  somewhere in windows system library 
 bilderbuchi i would like to  but i will be dead by the end of git clone of the repository

actually i just realised that it might not be reproducible with regular of generated geometry  i was having problems using a geometry shader that kept drawing outlines instead of being filled  for the above reason   i triggered it by calling "ofdrawbitmapstringhighlight  " and then running a geometry shader in the draw    maybe try the geometry shader in the repo preceded by a ofdrawbitmapstringhighlight    the latter has an ofnofill   command that triggers the bug  due to the following ofglprogrammablerenderer  draw   which calls glpolygonmode   
you mean removing the 'static' keyword  that won't resolve the issue since the fields still won't be zero'd

libc++ is the concern  i was just mentioning c++11 to give context incase people were unfamiliar 
sometimes it kepps working but there is like 1 second black screen  and sometimes it is critical and it close the program with a segmentation fault  my solution is to use a setpaused true  with a setfirstframe to avoid using stop for the moment  it works well   but i'd really like to use that stop in the future

i mean the memory usage keeps going up with the above code  while running   the destructor didn't release all memory  the problem is also mentioned on http   forum openframeworks cc t offbo deallocate 11834 and the problem leads to crash after a while

alec  it seems that the form fields on the cancelled reviewer page are set to disabled "disabled" as well as the form fields of the review form   so a normal user should be prevented from recording a review  i did not test however what's the case if i manually remove this disabled attribute and submit the form  i agree with  mtub that cancelled reviewers should be prevented not only from recording a review but from accessing the submission at all and i appreciate that you set the issue as a milestone for 2 4 7

ok     since i have re installed rails we can no longer get message that rails is not installed  for this gist i issued    and then i issued the  rails  v  command and this is the response    https   gist github com 4355447
 nacengineer this is the latest repository source   it says on the website that you have the option of installing the latest repository source version or the most stable version  http   beginrescueend com rvm upgrading    i choose to use the head with the understanding that i will have access to the newest features but that i may encounter more bugs  if you are concerned about stability then you should use  rvm get stable  instead of  rvm get head   besides  this is more of a cosmetic issue than anything and i'm sure it will be fixed in the next release 
that's strange  i reinstalled 1 14 5 again and it seems to work now     closing  sorry about that
not fully fixed as i can tell  i tested  rvm get head  and it has the correct directories the first time you  gem env   but on a new shell env or something  it goes back to  mpapis   i tried  rvm 1 16 5   same problem  i have  rm  rf    rvm  between installs  i checked '1 15 10' which works

it's 64  bit windows with core i5 processor  the whole vm might be slower than a native installation  yes  but when opening a new terminal without rvm takes less than a second  and with rvm takes  15 seconds  then i think something is wrong  i noticed from the the output  here  https   gist github com malaa 2ad100a75edb6d6e6ecc  that  __rvm_which  takes a very long time compared to the rest  could this highlight some problem  thanks

this come up in a discussion of implementing a function that returns the path to an executable that is written in ruby  which would be used in textmate to run that executable  what we need is a way to run that executable in the exact same way as if it was running from the shell  if one uses rvm it needs to select the correct ruby to run the executable with  normally if one runs the executable from the shell it would use the project specific ruby  if a project file is present  the default configured ruby with rvm  or fall back to the system ruby 
 pkuczynski i see it each time i open terminal  and unfortunately  rvm get stable   auto dotfiles  didn't solve my problem 
after enabling rvm  it overrides cd with a bash function  the bash function outputs garbage on stdout on certain versions of osx  running  echo   cd   which should output nothing outputs stuff
 pkuczynski sorry for lack of response  it works just fine with that patch

yes  i've tried  and its even more disasterous 
yes  you can submit patches to the mailing list  however  don't bother with old package managers like fink 
still too slow   ls  on webkit repo takes 9 seconds on my macbook 
i don't know but this issue is definitely caused in some way by oh my zsh  the first step would be to locate the source of the error before even thinking of a solution imho 
yeh and there have been no updates in a month  so seems kind of silly for it to prompt me every 6 days on all my servers  if only there was an "a" option for "always" so at least i'm not prompted 
thanks guys  already fixed it 
i can reproduce follow my steps
i guess i was wrong  its centos 5 5 zsh 4 2 6  i686 redhat linux gnu  centos release 5 5  final 
will do as soon as i'm near a computer  on sunday  june 5  2011  betawaffle reply reply github com wrote 
i find this was because of locale setting  when oh my zsh was installed in mac  i find the locale setting will be  i searched in google  i find there was some one encountered the same thing
what  yes  of course i do have git extras installed  i also added the git extras plugin  but it doesn't work for me  as described above 
  yes  i am able to do a  cd  a    yes  the behaviour soed persist  even if i go out into a subdirectory of  a and go directly back into it it is still expanded  a source of oh my zsh sh does not help    i use my own theme  copied parts of different themes   so this might be wrong  the important part seems to be 
if    profile is sourced  i would recommend changing the readme to let people know to move the offending content into  bashrc  i'm never sure which dotfile to put my bash setup stuff  and i'm sure i'm not alone in that  so there are probably several other people who have stuff in    profile that will break 
well so far i've added the code below to my current   zshrc    i'm not sure how to integrate it into the  build_prompt  method so it looks right with the current theme 'agnoster' 
thank you so much for the hint with infocmp  i'm so much intimidated by this terminfo issues     i don't understand why this is so hard and so complicated and so hard to agree on    the diff between the infocmp of the main machine shows the difference   even though both systems are opensuse tumbleweed and have the same terminfo package  terminfo base 6 0 12 2 x86_64 but then i remembered the unfortunate issue that the suse maintainer could not agree with the urxvt maintainers about the "correct" terminfo  i installed urxvt from source some weeks ago  as some bugfix came along  this overwrote the file   usr share terminfo r rxvt unicode 256color when i force reinstall the terminfo base  everything is fine again     so  this is a terminfo     urxvt issue  not related to zsh  sorry for bothering you  why this only happens with ctrl d and not with exit also puzzles me     but i'm really happy now  thanks again 
my  bin folder is ahead of  usr local bin in   path   but i made sure to  chsh  it to the right version of zsh   maybe i need to install the rc of git 2 0 
i reverted the vm to an earlier state  fedora 20 installed  nothing else done   the same error occurred  so i ran your command and got the following output

thanks for your reply  mcornella   i am using the   bin bash  for now  do you suggest i do  echo 'exec  path to zsh'       bashrc  
output with af magic  broken   http   sprunge us kjge output with gallois  works fine   http   sprunge us lexh  if you want it in gist specifically  i can do that  i'm just used to sprunge    command   sprunge    since themes change ps1 quite a bit  i suppose changing it does solve the issue  so this is an issue with af magic's ps1 then  doesn't explain why it worked fine on all my other machines though   
i had only backed up the     zshrc  file  its the same file i am using currently  which tells me i was using the robbyrussel theme earlier and i only had the  git  plugin enabled  i don't know what   zsh_custom  is  meaning i am not sure if i had anything in it prior to reinstalling      ncanceill  are you saying that with only the robbyrussel theme and git plugin enabled  the prompt inside a git repo only shows the current branch  i am asking because browsing the closed issues i found many comments suggesting that  git_command_prompt   or something similarly worded  solved the issue of showing detailed git status prompts  btw  in case the correct behavior is to only show the current branch  can someone help me display the info i want  googling for this simply suggests to use an appropriate theme  without specifically mentioning one   i like the current theme and would like to make things work with this theme 
 mcornella  only  git  is loaded 
 ncanceill yes  those are the exact steps to reproduce  if i type a partial path  this also triggers the freeze when pressing tab  i should also mentioned i'm running os x yosemite 10 10 3  i'm happy to help find the commit  but i'm not familiar with  git bisect

hi  thanks for checking this out  i thought this was probably something to do with some atypical configuration of mine or similar  to try and avoid this i tried the same in a fresh vm  with the same result  here's the result of  omz_diagnostic_dump  in that vm  https   gist github com bobwhitelock 219dc5924cc1eae8372e 
here it is https   gist github com fbbdev b12abaa00c89d6799015 i suspect it's a key mapping problem  home and end keys also stopped working on the command line

all i did was put in zsh_theme "robbyrussell" i was just trying to test to see if it was working or not  i saw that it looked like the default file had more in it  however the online community seemed to think as long as you just have that in there it will change the theme  if i’m supposed to copy and paste a block of text in please just provide the text file and i’ll do so  i also wanted to create some aliases but those weren’t working either  from  kaleb elwert  mailto notifications github com  sent  march 7  2017 4 59 am to  robbyrussell oh my zsh  oh my zsh noreply github com  cc  bgb0923  bgb0923 gmail com   author  author noreply github com  subject  re   robbyrussell oh my zsh   zshrc file is missing   uninstall not working  #5939  what are the contents of the  zshrc file you created  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  https   github com robbyrussell oh my zsh issues 5939#issuecomment 284675362    or mute the thread  https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth awuhlljx6ejxamd3htpnqna31nqb9fkrks5rjspggajpzm4mu2yl     https   github com notifications beacon awuhlougds2qfoljma9iaqxbh1krwf2bks5rjspggajpzm4mu2yl gif 
well  i solved this problem by modifying the theme for  zsh_theme   "robbyrussell"   each time iterm2 or terminal opens and executes each command  the entire console waits for a few minutes to continue  in this process  i can monitor a background of the python process takes up a lot of computing resources 
i do have an alias to  vim   servername v  
yes i did  same issue  i am very interested to know if this related to my recent upgrade to high sierra or not 
i have added all the changes that i have made to my  zshrc file that is located on the linux server  thanks
hi  mcornella   thank you for responding  i just realized that i clearly missed a step on installing git bundles  i'm a fool  but finally everything works  relaxed 
yes  most recent version  theme     oxide 
hey  mcornella thanks that you are trying to help me    i tried this options but unsuccessfully  i'm using dimmedmonokai theme  powerline fonts are installed too  as i wrote everything was fine until last ohmyzsh update  my zshrc is very simple  zsh_theme "agnoster" plugins   git   source  zsh oh my zsh sh export ps1 "   033 36m   u   033 m      033 32m   h    033 33 1m   w   033 m     " export clicolor 1 export lscolors exfxbxdxcxegedabagacad alias ls 'ls  gfh' alias bashr '     bash_profile' alias adblogc 'adb logcat  c' alias adblogd 'adb logcat ' alias gradlew '  gradlew' alias gmaster 'git push  u origin master' alias bpedit 'nano    bash_profile' alias adbscr 'adb shell screencap  p  sdcard screen png' alias adbgrab 'adb pull  sdcard screen png' alias adbrem 'adb shell rm  sdcard screen png'

hey  mcornella sorry for the delay  didn't see the notification for your comment   which made me realize that  rails  isn't in the list of bundled commands  https   github com robbyrussell oh my zsh blob master plugins bundler bundler plugin zsh   so now  side question  how do i add rails to the bundled commands list  but also  rake seems not to be doing the right thing because i get different behavior when i run  rake  versus  bundle exec rake   for example in one project it complains about a require_relative not loading the correct version of a gem if i run  rake  but if i run  bundle exec rake  it's fine  any other suggestions 
when run compaudit， there didn‘t return anything in my terminal， and also，there are which compdef print as below
yes 
here is the zshrc file
i can't seem to re produce the issue now  vim in both zsh and bash show the strange characters  on a side note  i changed my term variable because i was getting an error on nvim's   checkhealth   it told me to change to  screen 256color   so i did that  nvim is working fine  output from zsh  f 
that fixed it  thanks 
hi  in any terminal that i run zsh i got an error  even on cmd it gives me  382 segmentation fault  core dumped  zsh   i'm also using oh my zsh    git  version 2 17 1
it looks like it's the color codes in my prompt that are doing it  when i remove them  the problem goes away   it might be iterm2 that's doing this  but they don't appear to have an obvious support link on their site 
this is the only thing i changed however it was slow before i changed  zsh_theme "powerlevel9k powerlevel9k"  it got stuck at this part 
in my    zshrc   file i have the following configuration
sure  here you go
that was it  thank you    
 mcornella thanks for looking into this  the  npm_completion  has the following content   note  the npm completion module did not change since 2 years  that why i ruled it out so far  i use the following versions node  v12 16 1 npm  6 13 4
here is the output 
that was an output from firebug
ideal would be a plain text version of the express html exception page

so maybe i just add the filename into an array or object before casting response download and delele if there's no more requestors

hi doug approval for release of the code spinet is being gathered  in the mean time a url directly to a m4a file on the server will demonstrate the issue at hand  compare this with mp3 file  kr alex on wed  jul 16  2014 at 5 45 am  douglas christopher wilson   notifications github com  wrote  ## alex ramia onelive inc o +1 702 860 6161 c +1 702 466 6609 oneliveinc com this email and any files transmitted with it may contain confidential information that is legally privileged and is intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed  if you are not the intended recipient  or a person responsible for delivering it to the intended recipient  you are hereby notified that any disclosure  copying  dissemination  distribution  or use of any of the information contained in or attached to this transmission is strictly prohibited  if you have received this email in error please notify the sender by reply email or by telephone at  702  466 6609 and destroy the original transmission and its attachments without reading or saving them in any manner 
the path being used is   c  code web testing  my_app_name  _packages client_app public  it comes to about 60ish i think  and there are no spaces in there  just hyphens and underscores  the thing that strikes me as odd though is that path was exactly the same when it was working  it was just invoked from the main  app js  file not from a required file  i am not sure if it changes anything but the requires return a promise too  but it is handled correctly and i have logged output and everything gets evaluated as i would expect  its just when i go to a route     it blows up with the static handler 
no    the outsource team is working on setting up a set of tests  the question here is that we are using swagger node express for our api docs interface  one of the tests i added was to insert middleware that is outside of the swagger api to ensure that the amount of data wasn't the problem  and that works fine  hopefully it's a configuration issue for us  but it just makes little sense that i can use the exact same code without the secured connection and i get the full data packet  any chance this is related to a software package on the server  i am using node v0 10 30 
req connection remoteaddress is 127 0 0 1
i'm still waiting for a new http request  here is all the code handling my routes

ok  thanks for the quickly response 
i temporarily added this to my code this morning at the very beginning where i log incoming requests  i removed the logging code   just to verify that it wasn't me that was putting it in there somehow  i never use  __proto__     so  if you want to loop through the keys in query to see what query parameters are available  things get a little strange     hope this helps clarifying the issue  julian

thanks for the reply  wesleytodd i checked the network tab as you suggested  i notice an initial request followed at some point later by another request to the same url not sure why that one is being called  but an "img" requested it  are you familiar with how to resolve this  or should i just tinker with all the images until i figure it out

not sure where i'd be binding this at all  wesleytodd  could it be due to the fact i'm using  app use  deconstructed 
thanks for the insight and for the effort in maintaining  express   you're the own putting in all of the work and dealing with all of the tough issues  so i defer to your opinion  but as has been pointed out  using specific versions is a double edged sword  there's no clear simple answer and  express  isn't your standard  npm  package  but this is a challenge that all packages face and with the current ecosystem that has lock files in both  yarn  and  npm  and integrity checks becoming part of the ecosystem as well  i would argue that providing control to the user might be the better way to go  right now  some of the specific versions are getting old and how many undiscovered  or even worse  unrevealed  security issues are in that code  with the specific version model  all users of  express  would have to update after you've noticed that and made a release  which as you've correctly pointed out is a herculean effort on its own  to be able to get fixes found in those packages  i think we can all agree that this isn't a simple question with anything close to a clear answer  but the package management ecosystem has evolved a lot in the last few years and there are better tools to help manage versions than there were in the past  so it might be worth considering a potential change in policy 
hi  wesleytodd   thanks for your reply  improving my question  i have a middleware responsible for authentication using jwt  i would like to force all routes of my application to be authenticated by this middleware 
sorry  i didn't write that quite correctly  this  users  id is only numbers  does express offer a way to lockdown the endpoint to only numbers 
that sounds about right  i thought maybe there was a way to compute that automatically  but i can use  baseurl  for now  eta  apparently  baseurl  won't include a trailing slash even if the app was mounted on a path with a trailing slash  so to make the cookie apply to all requests for the sub application  you need   path  req baseurl + " "

the source objects it seems to be checking are dependencies from my other sub projects  given that sbt already checked for changes in that dependent sub project  it seems like sbt shouldn't have to to run through the sameapi apply to do the explicit check  i was looking at the analysis class and saw the stamps  i assumed they were used to shortcut external dependency checks as well as internal  binary and product   but i now see they are not   does that make sense  i'd really like to get the sameapi checks down  as right now it's faster to do an old xsbt compile when nothing's changed    i've been looking at wrapping the source objects with a file hash to shortcut the checks  do you think that's a productive avenue  thanks again

no  all events are posted from the same thread  synchronizing the eventhandler calls does not make a difference  i also added some debug logging to see which thread id posts an event  as you can see it fails to retain the events even though they are all handled on the same thread

yes  i've pushed it to https   github com jm g sbt tree fix 4773 memory leak   this branch is based upon 1 3 0 rc1  i can rebase it on develop this evening  the root problem imho are left over appender in the global log4j logmanager  i've added an state exit hook to clear those up  currently  there are log message in it  that i would change to debug  but i am in a hurry  after these changes i can open a pull request if you are interested 
after some testing  the  exportjar  approach above   does not work    two use cases  1  standard incremental compile  no changes to source code  expect a no op  measures just the overhead cost of scanning     my_app compile      takes about 1 minute scanning all the dependency jars to determine that no compilation is necessary  this should be instant  2  make a change to  my_low_level_lib   generate the jar  then  my_app run main      still takes 30+ minutes as it checks recompiles everything  this should also be instant  one small thing would allow this to be fixed  if the  exportjar  for all transient dependencies  i e  the  packagebin    could be flagged as "up to date" then it should be possible to have a workflow such that both the usecases result in near instant compiles  consider this workflow of  sbt  commands for the above step 2  1   exportjartracking     disables tracking  enabled by default  2   make internal change to  my_low_level_lib   3   my_low_level_lib compile   generates  packagebin   4   my_app run   instant  5   exportjartracking     enables tracking 6   make api abi change to  my_low_level_lib   7   my_app compile     recompiles everything necessary  go for coffee note that it would be useful if test configs aggressively checked if their compile configs are up to date  e g   my_app test  should run  my_app compile  if the sources are newer than the jar 
sonofa    i used the scripts from https   github com wsargent docker scala sbt blob master images shell  zshenv#l13 but forgot i was specifically overriding repo so i could get it to work with artifactory  https   github com wsargent docker scala sbt#artifactory my bad  you can close this out 
the sbt process had the following parameters  this is on the latest and fully upgraded macbook pro  i tried different options  xms xmx used to be 8g  and it made no difference  regarding memory dump  do you have any instructions for this 
here's the  debug update output  https   gist github com mighdoll 819a51753bebd2c2c8eb   there's this bit   which is consistent with the dependencyoverrides workaround  but i don't see any real clues  do you 
i've tried it with the following java versions  8 0 212 zulu 11 0 2 zulu 11 0 3 zulu 12 0 1 zulu
i can reproduce this on 2 of our bigger projects  they contain more than 10 subprojects and i use these commands   still trying to find out if any specific build settings trigger this

same problem  disappointed 
thanks 
plus some company plugins  i'm going to try and disable them one by one and see if i can't find the culprit  creating a completely empty project  i'm unable to reproduce 
looks like it is duplicate  sorry about that  i was trying to find such topic using "Óh" keyword  anyway using given encoding switch made it work again  thanks  proper fix for the rest of the people using sbt play framework     would be also nice  i'm sure there is a lot of them 
several projects in a read only source tree with target set to writable directories   project a b c  depend on commonproject  when projecta is built  the referenced code determines that  src commonproject  is not writable and copies it to staging  this is completely unnecessary  though 
sure  i will test it and report back  looks it is fixing the same issue i have 
hey this helped me  in the parent directory create a build sbt file and place the following in it  librarydependencies +  "org apache spark"   "spark unsafe_2 10"   "1 5 0" librarydependencies +  "org apache spark"   "spark streaming_2 10"   "1 5 0" librarydependencies +  "com datastax spark"    "spark cassandra connector"   "1 5 0 m1" librarydependencies +  "com datastax spark"    "spark cassandra connector java"   "1 5 0 m1"
yes  it does  the steps i just did to check    removed sbt's installation from control panel    downloaded  sbt 0 13 12 msi  from  here  http   www scala sbt org download html    created an empty directory and called  sbt  dsbt log noformat true  in it  the same problem occurred   but kept downloading stuff for some time since this is the first time in the new installation     then  called  sbt sbtversion  to make sure of the installed version  screenshot    sbt log noformat 12  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6719916 17529187 af96c284 5e72 11e6 802f b870c8a2a82d png  note  the screenshot is for calling  sbt  dsbt log noformat true  for a second time after the first time that downloaded many stuff  that's why there're no  downloading    lines  and to confirm  the error message showed in both the first and second calls 
the problem happens only when coursier plugin is enabled and doesn't happen otherwise  should've thought of trying that  so  i guess the issue can be considered non existent for sbt  will contact coursier's developers  thank you 
 eed3si9n thanks for your response  we are using the typesafe config library  where the resolution of the configuration settings is dependent on the order that reference conf and or application conf are found on the classpath  that means if we have a common component that is used across a number of subprojects  then we have to copy the test configuration to every subproject  this is possibly fine for a single case  but it gets unwieldy and difficult to manage with many shared components  if sbt was consistent with the order of the classpath  then this would be relatively trivial  i e  it would "just work"   my expectation was definitely that test classes for a project or subproject should always come before classes based on my experience using maven 
sadly  after few library updates and a bit of changes in code  though  not in module for which stackoverflowexception happened   upgrade to 1 2 1 seems to be working fine  next week  i might try to find the commit  at which upgrade didn't work and then try to narrow down project  but no promises 
 eed3si9n on win10 
apologies the statement about 0 13 was not entirely accurate  i was running repeat " " scala js fastoptjs and fulloptjs commands on an aggregated project  6 or 7 scala js sub projects  hours a day  nearly every day for many months though multiple versions of sbt 0 13 and multiple versions of scala js  so the functionality definitely worked for me on sbt 0 13  when i switched to sbt 1 0 0 i discovered the functionality no longer worked  i tried to return to sbt 0 13  but despite a couple of attempts i wasn't able to get sbt 0 13 to work again on my project  i will edit the opening comment 
1  what gets printed when you run sbt about in a completely empty directory  sbt about  "c  users yuriys  sbt preloaded org scala sbt sbt "1 0 0" jars sbt jar"  warn  executing in batch mode   warn  for better performance  hit  enter  to switch to interactive mode  or  warn  consider launching sbt without any commands  or explicitly passing 'shell'  info  loading project definition from c  users yuriys project  info  set current project to yuriys  in build file  c  users yuriys    info  this is sbt 0 13 15  info  the current project is  file  c  users yuriys  yuriys 0 1 snapshot  info  the current project is built against scala 2 10 6  info  available plugins  sbt plugins ivyplugin  sbt plugins jvmplugin  sbt plugins coreplugin  sbt plugins junitxmlreportplugin  sbt plugins giter8templateplugin  info  sbt  sbt plugins  and build definitions are using scala 2 10 6 do you have project build properties for your current build  no  i run from work directory
 gmethvin good news   2 6 7 with sbt 1 0 2 does seem to be ok so far   limited testing but so far changing javascripts is no longer crashing file watching  thanks 
there is currently no public repo  but if you just use this as an  build sbt  file   akka stream 2 4 20 depends on akka actors 2 4 20  which is supported by the version range   but sbt resolves akka actors 2 5 11  not sure if this is intended   in that specific case  it's easy to fix  but if you have a project  which explicitly depends on "2 4 20" and depends on library  which transitively depends on " 2 4 3 0 "  sbt could resolve the 2 4 20 dependency satisfying all constraints  but it seems it resolves to 2 5 11 issuing eviction warnings  
works like a champ  thanks   eed3si9n  sorry i didn't report back on time  i appreciate all your hard work    
no  i'm sorry  i'm just an sbt user  not a scala guy  and i don't intend to become one 😉    i'd have no idea how to fix that 
 eed3si9n this issue is merged upstream and can be probably be closed after the necessary coursier upgrade  any timeline of the upcoming sbt release 
i make a temp repository on git hub  the adress is   pic for sbt  https   github com greatmengqi picforsbt git   in this repository i make a small video to record the logs when i start sbt in idea   the start command ：   library java javavirtualmachines jdk1 8 0_171 jdk contents home bin java  server  xmx1024m  didea managed true  dfile encoding utf 8  jar " users chenmengqi library application support intellijidea2019 1 scala launcher sbt launch jar"   addpluginsbtfile  private var folders y4 ff7xp6qd73d73k_t4kd7jn8h0000gn t idea1397 sbt "  set ideaport in global    56866   idea shell"  
hi  i just tested that by using the following procedure  1  i changed the contents of  build properties  to  sbt version   1 3 3  2  i've run  sbt update  3  i've run  sbt test  same problem  i haven't upgraded the system version of sbt though  my brew  mac  says the system version is  1 2 8   here is the output of  sbt about  outside of my project folder 
with the realm blank i still get unauthorized  no question about spelling though    setting it to  null  resulted in a npr 
 eed3si9n  you are welcome  i had just reinstalled sbt  so that was 1 3 8  msi   the server where i noticed it first was 1 3 4 
publisher
ok i solve it i give an argument to save   like this p save no_signals true  it work but i can't understand  many thanks 
yeah  that's what i meant  the field works great for the plug ins i wrote  should we use that same field for all the built in plugins  like link 
here the full traceback   http   paste pocoo org show 212626  i'm using django 1 2 rc 1 and the trunk of django cms  do you need other informations

it only gives a 404 because it redirects to a page in the cms which does not exist  what happends is the following  it's try to redirect to the reverse  in this case something  but it removes the first 3 characters and replaces it with the url i've set in urls py in my case that would be 'cms' and the language i've set  'nl'  so the redirect url will become ' cms nl ething ' since this page does not exist it raises a 404
django version    1  2  0  'beta'  1  cms version    2  1  0  'beta2'  got cms today from git repo

ah  right  good point about the language location mapping being unreliable  will maps google com automatically redirect to the correct site 
after more testing i am able to reproduce on all pages 
it's hard to say no   
my bad  2 templatetags were affected 1  addtoblock wasn't in a block 2  inside a templatetag template a templatag was used with a wrong value  failing silently  issue can be closed  sorry
version is 2 2 and i am using a custom application which in turn uses placeholderadmin 
i'm aware of the workaround  however  i don't see the point of having the path rewriting magic at all  i mean  since cms utils page_resolver get_page_queryset_from_path does   the correct home page is returned for for an empty path even if the paths don't get re written  also  not rewriting the paths ensures the fact that redirects will properly work even after you change the home page 
 johnraz sure     the idea is to allow to prepare some prefilled predefined pages for the content managers  so it becomes easier for them to create new pages and not have to click together new pages with plugins  add a new page    select page type  or blank as until now     get a predefined page the new plugin in plugin system is very powerful it can be overwhelming for casual users  but this system allows for experienced users to rapidly generate various page types  for example  content page  page with gallery  page with teasers and so on  without have to write a single line of code  basically build your page and save it as page type  with this extension  we basically try to make a   first step   to expose the power of the plugins to less experienced users  it's not a new concept  lots of easy to use cms offer this as well  so  we hope it's a handy extension to the cms  hope this makes sense   d
thanks for fast reply    i am using django 1 4 5 with latest django cms  yes  pk 18 exists  it's strange  that mostly all is working as excepted  but some times error is thrown 
there are 2 languages configured and use_i18n true  here is my language configuration 
yes i am relatively sure    when i click the save button in the admin interface this message appears in the js console of my browser  chrome   the browser  chrome  says this in the js console when i click on save   i also didn't find any hardcoded http  but somewhere it has to come from  or not     
 acspike in this case i just created those tables and deleted the broken plugins  use the cms management commands and or manually do it in the shell   didn't have any more issues since then  but may just be lucky   still don't know exactly where it came from  appeared randomly 
no error message  but i believe i found out  what caused this issue  the templates behind the "container plugin" and the "contained plugin" were empty  once i actually filled them with markup  also moving them started to work  this is definitely an edge case but still slightly annoying 
pasted it on pastbin com  http   pastebin com sfc7rjwy
running a query on the actual id used   select   from cms_page where reverse_id 'personaltrainer_landing_page'  returns the expected 2 pages  1 draft  1 live  i assume the   1 0  on the end of the error was something cms related 
i'am using an old one  django cms  2 3 5  as required by arkestra  i will do tests with newer versions 
1 8 latest  i just tried to apply the 4 django migrations first and the issue still occurs  none of the other django contrib apps had migrations from 1 8 x to 1 11 x   i also tried to upgrade through 3 4 x first  i installed 3 4 6 with the all of the other packages the same  did a full migrate and then installed 3 5 x and did another full migrate and get the same error as above 
that's why i left the hvad with    it was not clear to me  i found a blog post stating that django cms made turn to hvad  additionally most aldryn addons make use of hvad   yet i believe since the cms does support multilanguage content and there are cases where it is needed  in greece most projects demand at least 2 languages  it would be nice if the official documentation could provide guidelines as how to implement such functionality compatible to the rest of the cms 
django  1 6 5 django cms  3 0 3
yeah what hepptux wrote will reproduce it  i also tested it with all versions since 3 0 3  seems 3 0 3 is the last working version regarding this behavior  just drop me a note if you need a downstripped example django app  if you prefer a pull patch  i could create one  but as i wrote earlier my patch is merely a sympthomatic one with nearly no knowledge about the interna  and possible side effects  
i'm using django cms version 3 0 7  i'm using these modules   i'm using python 3 by the way  to give you a better clue of what might go wrong  the relative url is resolved by chrome  v39  to  http    host  admin cms page 123 advanced settings cms css cms toolbar sideframe css   
sorry  django cms  3 0 12
no retina display  versions   the   img   tag contains one of the magnifying glasses  and the other one is added as a background to the   a   element through the  related lookup  css class  defined in   admin css forms css

3 0 13  apologies  it looks like this has already been fixed on the develop branch in 27be973b025c59eb6362ac0f34a0189d5adb8cc2
sure  i can do that tomorrow if that's okay with you 
i'm sorry can't provide more info at this one  due to deadlines we dropped the page and re created it  the new page had no issues  i close this and reopen in case we can provide valuable information   
thanks for your quick response  yakky   you are totally right  it seems as it was something i had wrong on my configuration  our front end developer confirmed that everything was ok  i'm going to mark this as invalid  thanks a lot again for your time 
 finalangel i could  but i am not sure how to better implement this  so far i see two options    add navigationnode is_page which would be set to true for all pages   add attr 'is_page'    true node namespaces might also be used but this might interfere with existing code so maybe it's not such a good idea 
hi  czpython   yes  here is the report  
hi  czpython no it is also happening with image plugin    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4224414 22008193 f7d333de dc9e 11e6 80d9 101eef921f46 png  i'm using djangocms text ckeditor  3 3 1
oh  i was under the impression 3 2 1 was the first compatible release for django 1 9  i'm not sure why i was under that impression  i'll revert to 1 8 9 and see what happens

because compression degraded the image quality in the pdf for certain images 
i found a dirty workaround with zoom  it seems that heroku uses 72dpi for rendering like mentioned here  https   github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf issues 1782#issuecomment 46570110 but my windows8 uses the default 96 dpi  you need to compensate by calculating 72   96  0 75 and use zoom 0 75 if you want the same result like at a windows8 machine  because the default is zoom 1  but its not a nice solution because you are not os independent  maybe there is a fix in the future 
yes it does  the pngs are created using the canvas javascript method todataurl   and then saved using php  note that there is supposed to be 0 transparency  i am looking for a solid image

thank you so much for your help over the holiday season  i have encountered a new issue that may be due to docker itself  but i'll provide you with the details to see what insights you can give me  i ran the following inside of the docker container   so the static binary works on my host machine but does not work on the docker machine  i'm used to bash so it might be a shell thing  any insight is appreciated 
 marianopeck no  unfortunately i have not  i will be using either a static pre rendered background image  or not use wkhtmltopdf at all  make use of css'   media  queries and simply let the browser generate a pdf via ctrl+p  the downside of the latter approach is  no browser seems to be able to convert inputs and textareas to editable form pdf fields like wkhtmltopdf does  i do not know of an other html  pdf  tool which is able to do that 
see workaround
thanks for the suggestion  i'll try it  the 0 13 version is only available on bitbucket  there's some other way to install it rather than manually build it   pip or conda

 jmauerhan  thanks for reply i believe it shouldn't  if i correctly see the idea of  assertarraysubset     it is "make sure that keys i specify in this subset match the data and nevermind rest keys"  the way our team  and i believe rest users too  use  assertarraysubset    is to check some most important parts of output  so  absolutely definitely keys not specified in the subset  "g" in this case    should not   be present in the diff 
i'm using the laravel framework 5 2 extending the following class   illuminate foundation testing testcase   which in turn extends  phpunit_framework_testcase  i created the following test class in  src tests test debugtest php    php class debugtest extends phpunit_framework_testcase   public function testdebug      var   false   this  assertfalse  var       running  phpunit  in the same dir as my  phpunit xml  still produces  no tests executed   running  phpunit src tests test debugtest php  i get the following  class 'src tests test debugtest' could not be found in ' var www project dir to package src tests test debugtest php' the file does exist in the path 
so  it seems the issue is that i'm trying to  include  the cli script  since it's not executed via a shell  the interpreter is complaining  that's unfortunate though since i have a direct need to wrap phpunit  in order to execute code before and after the process  this is with php 7 4
i'm new to phpunit   just a few hours  though i used cunit a lot some years ago   so far i've just used the default output printer    
i used a remote file upload sync from netbeans  from my mac  this means that ### on the mac    project  vendor bin phpunit     project  vendor bin phpunit    phpunit phpunit phpunit  in this instance  __dir__  is   project  vendor bin phpunit phpunit  and the first item in the search path find it's mark  ### on the server  the symbolic link has been replaced with a real copy of the file  so  __dir__  is   project  vendor bin  and nothing matches  the three options appear to cover the first case where phpunit script is run from the vendor package  the last case the phpunit script is the project directory  or in the middle case any first level directory such as  project  public or  project  tests  my situation doesnt appear to be handled  yet it is not exactly a failure mode  i do not want to run composer install on the server every time i sync to get a working system  since i am syncing and running the tests every 3 seconds

omnibus is fine  as it ships with 0 2 0  so i'm guessing you'd fixed it here  https   github com lamont granquist ffi yajl commit ee07411d898a9641ff8904a67710658929e6ea80 probably just need to make sure we pin chef's gemspec to  ffi yajl  '   0 2 0'  and we'd be good for weird people like me who might have installed chef by gem 
chef 11  i guess this is akin to assigning a variable twice and expecting both values so i wouldn't be surprised if a warning in the documentation is the solution  it is just a trap when multiple recipes set the same attributes which is seldom a good idea  http   docs getchef com essentials_cookbook_attribute_files html#use attribute files    here 
hey lamont here is the stack trace  in case its at all helpful  i whipped up a very simple cookbook to help illustrate the issue  https   github com dpetzel gh2558_test there are two tk suites  the chef_gem one will fail  the package one will work  while i'm sure you have valid points on how the code could be improved  it did work on chef 11  and does work other resource type i've tested  since it runs as part of the run  there actually is a node object kicking around that it uses cc'ing  calavera as he knows this code  minitest handler  way better than i ever could 
yup   looks like it's trying to use  tmp as staging  only saw that when i set the log_level to debug  i assumed it would use the directory it was downloading to for staging like wget  quick question   any idea how i set the file_staging_uses_destdir in vagrant and chef solo  i tried creating a file with that line and adding chef custom_config_path   "  config rb" to my vagrantfile but it still uses  tmp  thanks b
so let me ask you  do you guys get a webpage here  http   www opscode com chef download i get internal server error still 
everything works as expected it just tries to download from a url that doesn't exist  as it's looking for 2003r2 in the url path instead of 2008r2  two things could happen here the easiest would have a redirect point to 2008r2 or an update to knife for 2003 to pull 2008 the knife command that i used was  knife bootstrap windows winrm  fqdn   n  fqdn   e  env   r  role   x  username  and you're right it  this does seem more like a bug with knife windows

i did not see that "hide button" entry before   
there's nothing wrong with it  i just got so much in the habit of "o"  it's one less keystroke      
no  if f is mapped to activatelinkhintsmode then pressing f once should bring up the hints and pressing f again _could_ hide them again  right now you can accomplish this by pressing f  then pressing  lt esc gt 
yes  every site i visit  i'm sorry  i should have mentioned  i'm actually running srware iron  however  i have never seen this in the dozen or so machines on which i've run this combination  iron and vimium   right now  i'm running iron v  12 0 750 0  88000  which i just upgraded  from v  11  today  both v  11 and 12 behaved the same way   no links work for any site when using hints  if you think it would help  i will see if i get the same behavior with the latest version of chrome  please just let me know 
it's working now  i don't know why but it's working  i think i'm going to like this vimium  thank you for your fast reply  appreciated on tue  feb 7  2012 at 11 07 am  phil crosby   reply reply github com
i can't speak for any of these extensions myself  as i try to limit my extensions  but the top two hits are  split screen  https   chrome google com webstore detail split screen eachfleknamlcepmplpdghagngjfjkin hl en and tab scissors  https   chrome google com webstore detail tab scissors cdochbecpfdpjobpgnacnbepkgcfhoek hl en it looks to me like the former is a little slicker  i tried to find where split screen is developed  but without much luck  i'm not sure how i would find out if it uses iframes 
 mrmr1993 you can try it here http   msafi github io upload form angular html
i just tested again after disabling the extension and i have the same kind error message  usually after disabling the extension i didn't get any error message 
i'm on mac  and press  option 4  for dollar sign 
 smblott github all ways of navigating in that list didn't work as intended  arrows included   i have 1 49  from chrome store   i'm gonna include my system specifics   user agent mozilla 5 0  x11  linux x86_64  applewebkit 537 36  khtml  like gecko  chrome 40 0 2214 94 safari 537 36   system arch linux 64bit   browser chromium 40 0 2214 94
 smblott github i found i can use f to select the status box for writing my status  so i think i can do it with search bar  i press f and keymap for status bar  with gi  i can use search bar  thank you
hey  thanks for the speed lightning feedback  stephen   i could have exhausted these tests before bothering you  please forgive me  well  it can get weirder  with  tab activate  disabled  i can map any letter  upper or lowercase  but     with  tab activate  enabled  all capital letters don't work  and any lowercase letter  or combination of lowercase letters  works  so   tab activate  somehow is interfering  for sure  by any chance have you come across or heard of any other extension like  tab activate   it just opens new tabs on the foreground   but which doesn't mess with vimium   i'd be happy to switch over 
the only other flag i have is scroll prediction  however i already had enabled this before i got an issue 
version 41 0 2272 76 ubuntu 14 04  64 bit  vimium 1 51 is the fix in #1279 to use a different version until the chrome bug is fixed 
exactly  thanks 
 smblott github vimium is working on all sites for me  and that page is not in the exclusion rule 
yes  this alphabet hints  digital hints are working properly  i use them  yes  in google chrome also not working  and under windows this problem too  if the russian layout  press f  then hints appear  but when you press the key with the required letter  all the hints disappear and nothing happens  i do not know how to show it in the screenshot   
i'm not sure that's what you want  since with visual mode  afaik  you go to the text you want by manually moving around with the motion keys  find mode seems like a better fit since it enables you to jump directly to where you want more quickly 
great that it's there  would highly recommend to have it in the    help  this could be one of my prime shortcuts if i can make it a little easier to use using some customization of keys  on a separate note  i do find it a bit difficult to use and since it mandates capital letter  it adds an extra shift key which is a bit difficult to press quickly 
hi  smblott github  thanks for responding  no  i don't use  ctrl  for typing      when i want to type      i usually hold the  alt gr  key to the right of the space bar while pressing the  8  key  you can see the typical danish keyboard layout i'm using here    my keyboard layout  http   fontmeme com images danish keyboard 550x183 png 
oh my bad  i could use it in my language mongolian  now  can i add my language layout to vimium  thank you 
no  on learn co when page size is 100  scrolling using vimium works fine but when you adjust the page size to 90  you lose scrolling using vimium on that page  page is not shorter than the screen  scrolling using arrow keys or trackpad works but vimium stops responding to scrolling commands 
you're right
hi there  i havent made any changes yet after reading your last comment  i'm just confirming that "no" f "still doesnt work and yes "gi" works
hi mrmr1993  i tried that option but it didn't work for me  gleebox is a tool i also use and it is invoked by pressing ' '  or any other defined shortcut   it pulls up a small window where i can type in commands  with insertmode i can still invoke it  but then i can't dismiss it  either by using 'esc'   i have to refresh the page to enter another command which defeats the purpose 
yeah figured it out  once the shell was being loaded  it thought the iframe was at about blank    i needed the following rule if that helps anyone   
the symptom disappears when i use a fresh profile 
if i enable vimium  the problem i outlined in my previous comment exists  if i disable vimium  the problem goes away  for what it's worth  i'm using firefox nightly  the problem has existed for a couple weeks now at least with each of the nightlies  i haven't checked if this problem exists on the beta stable channels 
if you mean the console for web pages  there is no error for vimium
it might very well be that the issue only appears if the stylesheet is loaded by another extension  i haven't managed to create a simple example  but using stylish on firefox with the  'my twitter dark' style  https   userstyles org styles 147945 my twitter dark  will have the effect i'm describing on twitter com 
yes  sorry  that's exactly what i meant 
tried that  it doesn't work and the top line of the extension's window says "vimium will exclude     c"  so i guess this doesn't do what is expected 
 w3c says  http   www w3 org tr html401 interact forms html#h 17 11 2  that accesskeys use the document character set  utf 8 in the case of jsbin   so  no  you can't use the arrow keys as far as i can tell  using period and comma would be suitable but my suggestion to use h and l was derived from the vi editor which uses h  j  k  l to represent left  down  up  right  the idea is to keep your fingers close to home row as much as possible   this shortcut convention is used in other software  notably in google products such as gmail and google reader 
i sent an email with a screen shot i'm only seeing like 6 bins thanks for the prompt reply

i uploaded  an example  http   shower loc embedding html  with all three embedded tools  the  jsbin example  http   shower loc embedding html full#a jsbin example  is now weired to me  an hour ago  as i wrote this ticket  embedded jsbins were flipping  now they don't   but   they are very long  in sense of height  and cannot be restricted to another height  that's crazy  the embedding js seems to create a height of 3417px  which do overwrite my style with max height  maybe you changed the js in the meantime 
i think that's actually a really good   reasonable solution to the problem   
closing  fixed

yes  i have made checkout of the project  and built it by myself without running   npm install  g jsbin    actually  i have tried to install it using the above npm command line  but i got another error from bcrypt module and because of that i decided to achieve the installation by cloning the current jsbin project here on github  version 2 9 16   thanks for the quick answer 
lol  what the heck  i tried and tried to resize the columns before i posted this to no avail  this is now working  perhaps it was a safari problem  further  though  the codecademy method actually shrinks the output such that you see the entire output boundaries vs simply resizing the contents a la browser resize  i can see both options being useful 
stripping comments would significantly reduce the surface area for issues with loop detection  in my use case   ember flows generator  https   github com nathanhammond ember flows generator   i kinda like the idea of being "perfect" so it's likely that i do adopt esprima  i'm  for the near future  going to be api compatible with js bin's loop protection so you should be able to at least try it pretty easily and see what you think

very good point  i guess the real problem is over zealous content blocking  but with children under 11 i guess they prefer to be cautious  not sure what the answer is  could the session generator be modified to always use vowels in pairs  therefore there is no blacklist  but the likelyhood of spelling a word is reduced  or might that mean the likelyhood of duplicating session id is too high 
just this one line is enough   please see how the code gets"corrected"    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7103923 8485725 22dcc812 2100 11e5 91da bfa6c50db198 png

sorry for not being clear enough  i want vs to detect externally modified files  so i have checkbox set  but the files aren't detected as modified when vs gets focus again  i checked and cleared this setting but it doesn't change anything   if it is the same vs session  restarting vs can fix it i don't see how vsvim could influence this behaviour  so this is the real question  could it be a bug in vsvim which triggers vs from detecting modified files  thanks 
wow  0 9 3 is good news for today     as far as i see  the issue is still open  at least  there is a highlighting under the word "open" in the left column of the page    
for example  currently in normal mode of vsvim  also vim   when i press 'a'  if caps lock is on  it means append at the end of current line  if caps lock is off  it is append after current character  the problem is it always requires me to check caps lock state before type in a command otherwise it may cause some errors  so if there's an option to ignore caps lock state  then 'a' will always be append after current character and 'shift + a' will always be append at the end of line  that will be convenient

it's just my personal suggestion in non english speaking countries they use input method to input their own language just like chinese typing chinese in gvim in insert mode and my input method is on   then switching gvim to the normal mode  the input method will disappear so we can easily type command in english otherwise we should manual switch input method frequently anyway i like vsvim very much thank you for everything you done  
ok that sounds fine  so i made an update on my post containing a link to a gist  my other extensions on this machine are    highlighterr   powercommands for visual studio 2010   productivity power tools   todomanager
hi jared  thank you for the prompt reply  i think it is better for me clearly state my set up  1  using mac pro   lion  so i guess the keyboard layout is ansi united states  english  2  using vmware to run virtual windows   windows 7 64 bit  visual studio 2010 is running on this virtual machine 3  not only i can't cap a letter in the command  i can not input upper case command  e g  "u" instead of "u" 4  the cap was working fine with the previous vs vim version on the exact same set up  so i am assuming that this "may" be a bug  but i am really not sure  finally  thank you for creating this great vs extension 
 jaredpar sorry  i don't have my linux box to hand  will comment again later  no matter what i   set  for  virtualspace   in 1 6 0 1   set virtualspace   always comes back as  virtualsapce ""  i have no vimrc on this box  thanks 
huh  i can't reproduce it myself now  maybe i just typed wrong     i'll just close it again 
over the years my _vimrc has built up some cruft  i'm not sure where this originally came from  but i don't believe i need it or use it now  commenting this out made the clipboard command work again 
hi jarad  the extensions installed are    ms web dev tools   nuget   vs extensions for windows library for javascript   vsvim   r# 7 1   dotcover if i suspend r#  snippets etc work as expected with vsvim  cheers  ben on fri  aug 23  2013 at 3 14 pm  jared parsons notifications github comwrote 
 virtualedit all  is my default choice for vim  combines 'insert' and 'block' options   having it in vsvim will be great without dividing it into rarely used insert block variants  i mentioned  virtualedit block  as an alternative  possible easier one in implementation  because it resolves the most common and annoying problem i have    1  https   f cloud github com assets 1926430 1134046 7b1c2fae 1be9 11e3 9406 d6a67c607b04 png  having cursor at '1' i start visual block  after pressing 3j3l i get '2'  but expect '3'  btw i found out that pressing 3j  or  3j leads to one more variation provided by vim '4' 
right  however i like tab shift+tab a bit more  because tab shift+tab maintains the selection so that you can press tab shift+tab continuously to adjust the indention  the column mode does not work like native  e g  with "alt+shift+up down" edit lineupextendcolumn edit linedownextendcolumn command  vs2012  vsvim manage to enter a visual mode similar to vs's column mode  but they are quite different as i see it  vs's column mode allows continuous deletion and insertion while vim's visual mode can not     i thought this is an known intended behavior  besides the above two  the only other difference i can find is the cursor  so you've done really good job to maintain the compatibility  but isn't a "listen to esc only insert mode" easier to implement and completely native  just my 2 cents  maybe that's a bad idea  i'm not sure 
because i installed a gvim in this computer and then set up a path into the environment variables，as a result，the vsvim found the configuration files of my gvim_vimrc so it had something wrong  i deleted value in environment variables  now the promblem is solved，thanks for your help and attention 
it doesn't show up in vs 2012 either  it does show up in vs 2010 though 
 keyboard txt  https   github com jaredpar vsvim files 36767 keyboard txt 
where would i find the vsvimrc file  this is a clean install of visual studio 2013 and vsvim 
in this case it should be  according to http   vim wikia com wiki using_marks '' jump back  to line in current buffer where jumped from   " jump to position where last exited current buffer
vs pro 2015 update 3 vsvim 2 5 both ctrl e and ctrl y are working as expected 
i also have r# 2016  and it only happens on one of my computers  and unfortunately not always either 
https   xkcd com 1172  feels all too relevant 
yeah also the nvidia installer was failing when installing nsight  fresh re install solved it thanks
 ctrl m  can be an alternative to  enter  in vim  or bash   some people ues  ctrl m  to keep their finger at position of middle of keyboard as much as possible  before vsvim 2 5 0 0  i can use  ctrl m  without any problem  in edit mode  it insert a newline  in command bar  it submit an  enter   now i can only use  ctrl m  in edit mode 
will do thanks 
thank you ricksladkey  your solution   works for me    
not sure  actually  i don't see it in the  supported features doc  https   github com vsvim vsvim blob master documentation supported 20features md   but can't confirm that at the moment 
how do i see options  i tried  se all but it says not supported  i then did  se clipboard  and it says clipboard "" yy is something i do very often so i would have seen that freeze before  seems to be dd and right now getting superstitious  would it have anything to do with the file type  the file the freeze has occurred on last couple days is  json  in fact here it is below      " schema"  " https   schema management azure com schemas 2015 01 01 deploymenttemplate json# "  "contentversion"  "1 0 0 0"  "parameters"    "env"    "defaultvalue"  "dev"  "type"  "string"      "variables"    "route table" " concat 'ead '  parameters 'env'   ' sha route table'  "    "resources"      "type"  "microsoft network routetables"  "apiversion"  "2019 11 01"  "name"  " concat 'ead '  parameters 'env'   ' sha route table'  "  "location"  "eastus2"  "tags"    "displayname"  "udr   subnet"    "properties"    "disablebgproutepropagation"  false  "routes"      "name"  "route ase 0"  "properties"    "addressprefix"  "0 0 0 0 0"  "nexthoptype"  "internet"              "type"  "microsoft network routetables routes"  "apiversion"  "2019 11 01"  "name"  " concat variables 'route table'   ' route ase 0'  "  "dependson"    " resourceid 'microsoft network routetables'  variables 'route table'   "    "properties"    "addressprefix"  "0 0 0 0 0"  "nexthoptype"  "internet"         appreciate the reply  new ideas shoot my way i'll try it out  also i often would do something like select a block of text in view mode  then " p to put the selected text on the clipboard  have not seen that act up either  always works  i do recall at least once  that dd against a view mode selected block also froze vs 2017  on fri  feb 7  2020 at 9 29 am rick sladkey  notifications github com  wrote

hello  i had to move on with my development so i do not have original use case  i hdave tried to reproduce it also with clean  demo code  configuration and markup same   but it is working flawless    ps  is it possible that jstree will be having issues due to heavy css floating layout  on clean page everything works as expected 
i think i was using the tip version  in github  
works like a charm now  thanks 
here is a demo 
yeah  on your site it seems to work  www jstree com  but with jquery 1 11 1 and jstree 3 4 it is closing immidiately again  in  the callback of animation isn't fired open_node   function  obj  callback  animation    d  children " jstree children"  css "display" "none"  end    removeclass "jstree closed"  addclass "jstree open"  attr "aria expanded"  true   children " jstree children"  stop true  true   slidedown animation  function      this style display   ""  t trigger "after_open"    "node"   obj        
you are right  it is working  i did not know about the theme setting  'themes'     'name'   'default dark'    where is it documented  thank you for your help 
i tested it on 3 1 0 and 2 8 x  do you speak russian

actually i do have duplicate ids  the same tree leaves may be in multiple locations  is it possible to use one identifier for the ajax request and another identifier for jstree  this does not seem to work   thank you
thank you     i solve it

seting this   "drag_selection" false   as you reccomend solve my problem in my especific tree thank you very much 
nope i don't use jstree as a custom elements personally  maybe keep this issue open for future references  until someone who need this submit a pr  it looks like a small fix and probably anyone could do it  thank you for your super fast response

most of what i have tweaked is related to migrating from wko to cg  1400+ wko ride files got me on the automation path  things like mapping activities in wko to sport and workoutcode in gc  i also have a tss algorithm i used in wko since 90  of my training and racing are single speed mtb without a power tap  i spun up a console app where i can drop a gc json file and it will do the calculation and update the file with the tss value  looking at the possibility of moving to some variation of trimp but in the interim i want to keep generating the tss

sounds nice…    i'll try to give as much support as i can… that specific workout started with a 300m warmup  but the watch missed some pools there  if i remember that right  then followed 8x 50m  with drills on the first 25m  added manually at the end of that interval  and 25m freestyle  you will find them in the sml file if you do a search for    type stylechange  type   then you will find the drills    prevpoollengthstyle drill  prevpoollengthstyle   hope this help for now
trying a different ride    i tried a couple    few rides have smo2   and they are fine  i thought i had a bad file  but now when i go back to that file it is fine  odd 
how would it work for the particular example i posted using a workout code 
they need to be replicated however anyone can make a feature request and vote  you can also simply add a little chart to the main gc github page showing the the top requests from feathub and a link to vote or add new requests  i could pick some current issues from github to seed feathub until it catches on  if feathub catches on people should stop using github for requests and you could eventually close open requests in github  most projects still use both requests systems in a way but feathub could cut down on simple requests made to github  "please submit and vote on feature requests on feathub instead of opening a github issue" could be added github feathub chart code for readme md  ## feature requests    feature requests  http   feathub com goldencheetah goldencheetah format svg   http   feathub com goldencheetah goldencheetah      feature requests  http   feathub com causefx organizr format svg   http   feathub com causefx organizr

yes  if you change the  enum  keyword to  class  and remove  type1 "type1"    then highlight is still disappearing  in my real class where i initially observed this bug this enum is actually nested in outer class and this bug eats highlighting in the whole class but only above the line which you click  after you click   1   there is always this   and yes  it is not always the case but with bigger file this is much often than with this small example files  and to fix the highlighting almost always you need to click somewhere upper the   1    usually the class name when highlighting is broken  but only until you click somewhere below again  but not always  
 lombokissues thank you very much  you are right  and i'm going to close this issue 
i've opened a ticket with the bazel folks to try and figure out where the stacktrace is going   it's buried in the logs somewhere and i'm not sure where  do you know if the trace would be dumped to stdout or stderr 
take   throwing  exception class   
on the second thought   this can indeed cause ambiguous  so  something2name  should become  something_2_name  while  something2name  should become  something_2name   therefore 
this is the stacktrace  i've decompiled the class too  there aren't the getter setter methods  java lang nosuchmethoderror  com project fibramake bean layerproperties getlayerpozzettiguntati  ljava lang string 
 grimly  do you mean  over the public fields  well  1    consistent  unbroken  api    right now you have properties  getx   setx  and  gety   sety  backed directly into the fields  x  and  y   then you add calculated  getphi   setphi  and  getrho   setrho  properties  then you decide that it's better to store  getphi   setphi  and  getrho   setrho  as  phi  and  rho  fields  with making  getx   setx  and  gety   sety  calculated instead  2  don't forget that nobody forces you to use both  lombok getter  and  lombok setter  at once  you can use trivial  lombok generated  getter with more complex setter  e g   this value   value  repaint      or a trivial  lombok generated  getter with more complex getter  e g   return this value    null   this value   parent value    or only trivial getter with no setter  or trivial getter with other ways to set  like  t getvalue    +  void setvalue t value  string changereason    
 rspilker thanks for the reply  i am able to run my project but cant able to access my model object  as showing error on model class objects i removed multiple jar files   used for cross check version dependency 
 rspilker thanks let me try today 
no i didn't get the same tooltip  as i mentionned above  the only trouble i got is that  when i hit save button  the current class is removed from the target directory  even if there's no lombok annotation on the class  i face this issue since i use lombok 1 16 20  before this upgrade all was ok  the bugged feature is "compile on save"  the last lombok release make it fail 
hi  the name is   springtoolsuite4    i found "stslocationprovider" class which i guess is for spring tool suite  is it ok to change and create a pr for this 
 maaartinus   i wrote the ticket so that others can find it should they face the same issue  i don't think that someone needs to spend time on a fix for this  if someone really wants to improve the installer for this use case  i'd solve this by adding a combobox in the installer where you have to select your ide before you open the file selection dialog so that you can force the user to select the ini file instead of a folder  if eclipse was selected earlier  
this problem is very sensitive to some unknown factors in the environment and code structure  e g  i also cannot reproduce it on same version of jdk  1 8 0_242 though adobtjdk build  on my windows machine  it not reproducing every build  need to run build several times   i cannot reproduce it without nonnull annotation on even one of the parameters  i cannot reproduce it with delombok  i can't even reproduce it without guava supplier class as type of the parameters  only combination of linux + jdk build version  alpine uses musl so jdk is slightly different  + docker + certain structure of the code + lombok builder and nonnull annotations making this issue to appear  so maybe this is not even lombok problem but jdk compiler problem    i'm not 100  sure  i don't think docker is actually makes any difference though  it is just a convenient way of creation exact environment i need  i can give my docker setup that i've used  this opens shell in container  1    even for me this not always work  i e  sometimes it does produce exact same bytecode  though with my real code it happens 100  of the time but i can't put it here it is too big and have way too many dependencies 
i am execute mvn install it is happened my spring boot version is 2 0 7 when my spring boot version is 1 5 8 it is not happende 
i tried it with lombok 1 18 8  still the same message  in case it was a problem with my jdk  i tested it with a sapmachine jdk 11  that didn't work either  can i help you somehow else to reproduce 
i have found that the problem is in attribute of type java util list  the application does not know how to convert it to json  i'll close the issue 
i resolved the issue  i declared enum after declaring the fields  so i did the reverse and the error cleared
well    excluding functionality completely is one of the solutions  but having  tostring    working corectly is better   
 janrieke i do work on ij  and for maven build  yes it does effect 
 rzwitserloot let me provide some details  if you still think that it's out of the scope  leave the issues closed  let's say i have package  pkg   i create  pkg package info java  file of this content   in this case  dto field  field is treated by static analysis tools like non null field unless it's annotated by some  nullable  annotation  it would be very useful if lombok generates null checks in generated methods  ps  sorry for the late response  i was on vacation 
same problem also with edge release  tried a few minutes ago   i got the exact same error 
i'm sorry  i cannot emulate parsererror on jsfiddle  i tried  http   jsfiddle net scabbiaza b36hxq94 1  so i created test on my site  http   paqmind com temp ajaxerror  here is js code  http   paqmind com temp ajaxerror static src app js and bad js  http   paqmind com static js badjson js  if you can help me to do this on jsfiddle  i will remove links on tests on my site  thank you 
note   1  is shorter than   0  and results in 7 bytes of savings in the minified version  as well as cleaner code in the non minified version 
i expect the   then    method to return a new deferred  what i don't expect is that the  this  objects for   then a  then b   are different in a and b if a returns a jquery object but remain identical if a returns any other value   object 
the only way i've worked around this issue  is to set the transform back to zero  in   this demo  http   jsfiddle net mottie ja2ux33s 3     i used a "quickfix" css definition to override the transform before measuring the offset top 
what is a test case
basically  the problem is that calling toggle   twice doesn't leave it in the state it was before   it's permanently turned into an inline block element  even after the animation is over  it can be worked around by explicitly resetting the element back to inline after the animation is done  though 
we tried before  but ended up getting stack overflows in ie8  at the time  july 2014   we went from 1 9 1  but using 1 11 x crashed in ie8  1 10 2 worked fine 
indeed  webpack supports amd  commonjs and the umd format  awesome  very godo to know  i will do that  then     thanks for your reply 
i can't believe you are even arguing against something so obvious  this is just writing libraries 101  you write a function  the first thing you do is check the validity of the inputs  you don't blindly use whatever comes in  not as a general rule  anyway  you may decide to omit the checks for the sake of efficiency and code footprint  when you are not trading off too much debuggability  i understand you can do that in a lot of cases in jquery  where debugging whatever error may occur is trivial anyway  but this is definitely not one of those cases  here you get an error that is just impossible to debug  that's unacceptable  if one has to spend hours debugging a trivial error  the library is just unusable 
https   github com dreampie vue demo source in here
well   so i created this  fiddle  https   jsfiddle net langbert 4oqqhg9s 1    and it's working there  so it must have been something wonky w  my own code  closing this issue 
if i check against https   api github com repos jquery jquery tags i get a list of tags  where there isn't any information provided  which one is the latest stable  ok  it is  if i parse the name and hope  that '_alpha_' and '_beta_' means not stable  even so  i have to trust the order given in json  which may could change any time  it would be a lot easier and more secure to have releases  which provide additional information about release date and so on  especially the release date is one part  we use to show in our build environment  how long we didn't change  since it is released  i hope this is a valid and reasonable use case 
this was in node 4 2 3  we are also using jsdom  3 1 2 
just did bower install again on a different computer and it seems ok now  must have been the cache   thanks 
i'm sorry   i guess i didn't do my testing quite right    evedently had simply typed the link to jquery 1 12 wrong  turns out it's a non issue  thanks  
i believe the solution could be simple  i just would remove the  src selector js  and leave the  src selector sizzle   if the guy wants to use the   sizzle   he does so    app js   with   sizzle    totally modular and optional 
thanks for your time and feedback  request to domino is made  i will try to update my own code to be less dependent  switched to jsdom happy coding

 gibson042 yeah  just wanted to confirm that there wasn't reasoning behind the current setup 
 dmethvin i didn't specify a datatype  so  it should have picked the default value  also  there is no response data  my rails server response looks like this   head  ok  so  here  i am sending an ajax request to save data and i'm not expecting anything in response except the headers
thank you for your quick replies   dmethvin in attempting to provide a test case i did find a few places in my html where i was using a style instead of a class  those have been addressed  now  the only remaining times i get the csp warning are related to an independent angular library we are using  i am going to reach out to the angular library for assistance  i was able to create a simple example to demonstrate the issue with this library   i am content with closing this issue as there is nothing for jquery to do  once again thank you for quick reply and patience me submitting this issue 
https   jsfiddle net jz5p57k9 
i've removed everything that's unnecessary  regarding the jquery version  you may have thought it's 1 9 1 because you saw the  jquery 1 9 1 js  file   that wasn't being used and has since been deleted as well 
this is a normal html5 page  the problem is that the code does not break in any other browser and the error only appears inside the mentioned jquery function without any reference to specific js or div that might fail  in what cases is computestyletests   normally applied  maybe that could help to figure out to which js or div it refers    following the  msdn library  https   msdn microsoft com en us library h62awd63 28v vs 94 29 aspx  in the console refers to the following problem  _"object expected   you attempted to invoke a method or property on an object of a type other than object  or you passed an argument of a type other than object when an object was required "_
i set the  disabled  property on some links out of habit  since it works on buttons   only afterwards did i realize that it shouldn't disable the click handler  since the property is not supported on links  this is certainly not a critical issue for me  i just make it a habit to report potential bugs to open source projects that i use

hi  please find attached the test case   jquery load zip  https   github com jquery jquery files 2542749 jquery load zip  i have put together a simple test case and i noticed that the resources where correctly loaded in a sync way    and i noticed as well the following console message  this console message does not appear on my application  then i looked at it and i realized the following lines of code where introduced   as soon as i set back the   options async   false    the load   started working normally  please note the issue happens only at the first load  with no cached scripts    capture  https   user images githubusercontent com 21308710 47920077 0cc6e200 dea9 11e8 9de6 e253942036a9 jpg  considering that the majority of the ajax calls will be async  is it possible to pass a parameter to the load   to instruct loading the remote resources in a sync way  i tried replacing the load   with the get   or with   ajax by passing explicitly async   false  but it does not work when the above options async is set to true  long story short  i have to remove the options async   true  but i wonder if i can still run the majority of my ajax calls in a async way and process only the remote resources fetched with load   in a synch one  thanks a mill for the support

not interested in features  but rather timelines risks    i am one of the core committers to drupal  which relies on jquery  and  jquery ui  with jquery ui being in emeritus  end of life  status  it puts us into a hard place once if jquery 4 comes out   if   jquery 3 support is stopped  because that would mean that we are using an end of life js library based on an unsupported version of another library  so knowing what is planned with jquery 4 could help us support decisions we need to take one way or another 
i would love to  however i might need some pointers  i was initially thinking of using a jquery instance wide event  map   however it seems that we need to support ie 9+ which doesn't implement  map   is there anything already in jquery that i could use to associate data uniquely with a given native event  if not  should i roll my own partial  map  polyfill  i would only need  get    has  and  set    thank you for your time   
sorry about that  i wrote the issue up in a bit of a hurry and somehow completely overlooked the one it duplicates 
thanks  that allowed for compilation 
ok let's say you have 2 views in your app  one main view listing tweets  one user view when you see a user profile  both have 100 images loaded  when the user goes back from the user profile view to the main view you want to release those 100 images you loaded as you won't need them anymore  with your commit that profile view needs to keep all those image url in a nsarray and call removeimageforkey  100 times  i want to do neither of them  if  sdimagecache    cache memcache was a dictionary of dictionaries per cachekey  cachekey being set to 'default' if unspecified   and i had methods like   setimagewithurl placeholderimage forcachekey clearcacheforkey  i could     request to fetch an image using a cachekey  which would be different for the master and the profile view    clear that cache when the profile view unload  in a single step  without storing the nsimages i've loaded in that view 
i didn't   i guess it's a new section from the last time i read the main page  thx  i will test it out   
i could do that  but it does not seem to be the most logical step  i guess for people wanting to do cache related stuff  the first place they look at is something called sdimagecache when they look through the files  atleast  for me that was the first place to look at  and that didn't turn out to work the way you'd think it would  it could be me  but i don't find it to be very logical 
yes in the simulator it just make the app freeze it's just like if it blocks the main thread     but in the device it completely crashes  2013 1 9 olivier poitrey notifications github com
this problem happen every time  when i use iphone simulator 5 0
 bpoplauschi my app should support ios 5 0  so i had to use 2 x
hmm  interestingly  it does reproduce in the simulator  but i’m no longer convinced it’s in the sdwebimage code  i’ve got a uilabel on the same view that’s taking some json data that happens to be null  if i change that to non null  my app doesn’t crash  i can’t explain what’s going on     but the app is just crashing with no error message or an exception breakpoint being hit – even though i’ve got a breakpoint on all exceptions  the only thread with any source code in  happened to be in the sdwebimage call  so given the weird nature of the image it was trying to load  i think i might have put 2 and 2 together to get 5  i’ll close the issue now… thanks very much for the email and for the whole project btw – i use it in all fanatix’ apps which have around 10m users and it’s just outstanding  ian from  bogdan poplauschi notifications github com reply to  rs sdwebimage  reply reply gith ub com  date  monday  22 september 2014 20 11 to  rs sdwebimage sdwebimage noreply github com cc  ian wellock ian nightisland com subject  re   sdwebimage   nsnull rangeofcharacterfromset   unrecognised selector crash when loading image  #902  i just tried with the sdwebimage demo project and the url you provided and it worked fine  iphone 6 simulator   ios 8   does it reproduce for you in the simulator  — reply to this email directly or view it on github https   github com rs sdwebimage issues 902#issuecomment 56424754    " context" "http   schema org" " type" "emailmessage" "description" "view this issue on github" "action"  " type" "viewaction" "url" "https   github com rs sdwebima ge issues 902#issuecomment 56424754" "name" "view issue"

 mythodeia it seems that to get 304 status code we have to send last modified date in if modified since request header anyway  or etag in if none match  so  as i understand  there is no way to receive 304 status code with current implementation anyway  and yes  in that case we should store etag and last modification date with each image 
 mythodeia yes i checked the link you advice to check  but still don't know why get those warning  i think it's relate to the sdwebimage library  cause as the message of the warning said 
the version of cocoapods is  0 39  but i got the errors i removed this library's pod  but my project didn't works
hi just wanted to follow up  i solved the issue and it had nothing to do with sdwebimage  it was caused by content hugging and compression resistance priorities in interface builder  the issue was that the uitabbar had a content hugging priority of 250 but an image had a content hugging priority priority of 251  or vice versa  i might not be remembering right   anyway  once sdwebimage received the image and called setneedslayout    the layout broke because the uiimageview tried to expand around it  i think that 2 7 4 may have slightly different timing so the layout didn't break at first  but after a while it started happening again  i hadn't been aware that uiimageview could resize this way based on its content image  i fixed it by setting content hugging and compression resistance priorities on the uiimageview to 125 in interface builder so that the surrounding layout prevents the uiimageview from growing when its image changes  p s  the uitabbar was in the cell for legacy reasons  to avoid putting it in the header view or having to refactor the uitableviewcontroller to be a uiviewcontroller with uitableviewdelegate  uitableviewdatasource and nested uitableview  to make room for the uitabbar above the table  
yes  i've tried all the combinations  using both  using one of each at the time  i've also tried   force_load sdwebimage framework versions current sdwebimage   with and without   inherited 
yes they look the same  but in fact they are not the same  if you download and open the second image  you will see this  there is a 1 pixel wide row of pixels that are clear on the right side of the image  that is not present in the original    screen shot 2016 04 11 at 10 52 18  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 2697487 14420253 1880b106 ffdc 11e5 947a 050cd6a7932e png 
what is the demo project 
 skyline75489 that crash in my app  appstore version from other user  so    
sdwebimage version is 3 8 2  yet most of my code is still using sd instead of flanimatedimageview  here is my simple demo  i'd appreciate it very much if this problem could be solved  or at least let me known the reason about this phenomenon   issueaboutgifdemo zip  https   github com rs sdwebimage files 779322 issueaboutgifdemo zip 
we are seeing something like for 8 minutes screen time of the app  it was running 2 minutes in background which seems quite significant 
 mythodeia the demo project is in objective c  right  i am learning swift but i have never used objective c  i read that the images that are after scrolling are not loading because ios stops the loading for performance  so i am trying to avoid that and load all the images initially   only the latest images are not loading  can you give me some idea please 
i use 3 7 6 in sdwebimage  and i can replicated in your demo project 
 mythodeia this is image url that produces this broken image   https   www vlor net airing o files fileid 58dddc36165b0dab74c395bb
 bpoplauschi  sorry its not 3 7 6   please help
when a image is display first time  the  completed  callback will be invoked twice  the first invoke has no error and the image is set to the view  the second invoke get an error like below and the image is nil  but the view is not changed 
 mythodeia  dreampiggy get it  thank you very much 
thank you   dreampiggy  i'll give that a try  thank you for your speed in responding 
latest version  cocoapods  use modular commented  never mind  docs are difficult to read and not cover my cases so i won’t use that library anyway  on monday  23 september 2019  dreampiggy  notifications github com  wrote

since the current proxy implementation set the http proxy for the entire jvm  including in the repl  and java's proxy settings dosn't seperate between a no http proxy and no https proxy list  see http   docs oracle com javase 6 docs technotes guides net proxies html its probably possible to implement using proxy selectors  but they as i recall they must be implemented at the connection level  in clj http and pomegranate  not jvm wide  maybe lein should support proxy configuration or override the system default in the user profiles instead  my recommendation is going to the os system default  which is no_proxy using a comma separated list 
i would think that the   type pom  would resolve the dependencies if you were planning on using them for development  rather than just put the   pom  in the lib  it's been a while  so i'll have to double back on what i was doing that this caused me problems with the eclipse plugin

yes  i do 
afaik i don't see any problems with this  tried it out in xp  removed reply from project clj from the leiningen checkout and included it in the default profile map as a plugin  built leiningen  moved it to self installs and tried a repl   this worked  what about  trptcolin  
the servlet api is downloaded from maven central  depended by ring 
thanks  yes it is indeed very slow  i tried using the  lein classpath approach and i immediately hit the limits of my windows batch scripting skills  i fear i may have to give up on fixing this one myself  sorry

the  test  task generates a form that will reference all namespaces discovered from clojure files  because the plugin generation process has not been called at this time new namespaces won't be part of the form and thus not executed  all clojure files are part of the right path when tests are executed but their  eventually new  namespaces won't be run by the test framework

 hypirion lol fixed  thanks    
i'm willing to give it a try  just so i am clear    should i use lein 2 3 2 to start a headless  lein repl  and then connect to the associated port using telnet with 127 0 0 1  then again with   1 
that fix works for me  and is much simpler  i wasn't sure whether that function was only ever supplied two strings to merge  i can see that in uberjar clj now   thanks

i have been waiting for about an hour to update search index    it's still at  42  
as much as i like the local documentation  i think this is a place where it's ok to just have a url    it should only happen for the first time when upgrading lein or adding a repository  and the user probably has an internet connection at that time 
thanks for getting back to me  what does "installed manually" mean  to clarify  i'm currently   not   using the version from the repository  i'm using the download script from the homepage and i'm not sure how to build it  can i do that without clojure

you will have access to them in the trace  in my experience  you generally don't need to access the imputed and non missing values separately in the course of specifying a model  the main advantage to this approach is that data with missing values can be included with only a single extra line  without having to separate the missing from the non missing data 
setting the shape parameter got the model to build without an error  thank you  i'll get to the rest of the model later  i'm using  pymc3 3 0b  june 16th  2015  my machine is a windows 7 64 bit amd  with 64 bit python 2 7 6  when i need to  i build libraries with mingw64 
i used  pip install git+https   github com pymc devs pymc pymc3  as described in the readme  i'll post the full install output soon 
i am using pymc2 2 64bit  here is the code for tester 
i'm on redhat 6  and this is a fresh clone of pymc  i actually ran  python setup py install   prefix   pythonpackages  because i don't have root on this system  please let me know if you need any other information 
i see  what about finding the peak on this simulated array     index  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 2849257 5328055 7358767a 7d3a 11e4 88de 83d00310101a png 
basically because delta has to be the same dimensions as q q0   q   q0 + delta  if q were always at least 2d too then it would work  when astep is called  it's called with  apoint   self astep bij map point    inputs   which  i think  means it assumes it is sending the values point from one var  q   q is expected to be 1d since  if  any q_new    q0  or all q0    q     fails for a q  1d   any becomes ambiguous  but maybe np array_equal would fix it  it looks like there is a mismatch between the intent of vars  you can pass a list of vars to metropolis and it will deal with each independently  and how q is handled  you pass metropolis astep the values "point" from one var  and not the values from a list of vars that happens to be length 1   sorry i can't offer a neat solution    i don't know the history of these functions so i'm not sure whether you would want metropolis astep to be more general and allow updating of several vars  or more clearly for updating one var  where delta self discrete  would not make sense within astep  because delta is the same dimensions as q  not the same dimensions as vars  
ok  so there are at least two separate things going on here  first  i ran your code and got the same segmentation fault  after running inside a loop  i find the problem occurs after around 5 11 iterations  sometimes  however  the code won't raise an error but will just stop before completion  these could be two different things but i think it's likely they are the same  or at least related  making p an array of the same length as n and s fixes both of these issues  the error i posted is somewhat different  and as you say appears to be caused by passing multi dimensional arrays to pymc  it seems to be assigning observations to the wrong parameters  such that sometimes the value of s is assigned the wrong corresponding n parameter  when this causes s n  it throws out the pymc node zeroprobability exception  based on this  would you recommend flattening all arrays passed to pymc objects 
 twiecki for plotting  i'm happy with the current api  although i know so little matplotlib that i'm probably not the right person to ask   standardizing on seaborn conventions  or using seaborn routines   to the extent that that's possible  seems like a good thing   fonnesbeck i'm not going to be there  but there will be stan folks there  i take it you'll be there 
as an exercise i just rebuilt my environment in python 3 5 with fresh packages from pypi then latest theano and pymc3 from github and problem has gone away  for now i am going to assume this is some weirdness with my environment and will hopefully go back and investigate in 3 4
pymc3 is the latest  i cleared the cache but the error popped up again  i am not using the c++ implementation of theano but using the python native 
what exactly does unnormalized mean  i was wondering the same thing as related to a uniform  once again thank you
out of curiosity which version of theano  i'm using theano v0 8 2  are you using  and also are you using the development branch of pymc3  or just the normal v3 0 
if i set random_seed 0 for both calls to  sample    i get the same behavior  the second trace starts in a different spot  or if i just set the seed in the first call and don't set it for the second  is there something else i should try  this may be a naïve question  but does that mean i'm sunk  mcmc isn't going to work on this model  i was initializing nuts with advi  based on what i saw in other discussions here   if i just call pymc3 sample   it assigns nuts to the variables  takes a while to initialize  i think  and then sampling stalled at the 6th iteration 
additional plots added to initial comment   twiecki in the first alternative the hpd interval labels are always plotted centered  potentially far away from the actual values on the x axis 
 twiecki the weibull distribution page  i am also double checking on it  seems fine with all those distributions using scipt stats rvs but not weibull  thanks for checking in 
i cannot really replicate it  it only occurs for a particular model and a particular trace  i can upload and send you the pickles  if you like   i now got a waic estimate after thinning the trace

no  i'm not sure  i'm trying different things    but i recently read a paper that suggested a discreteuniform to reduce the "complexity" of the parameter space  he stated that just few numbers are possible there  i think that his motivation was to not make differences for example between 0 01 and 0 011 
this is exactly what i need  just couldn't find it in the docs  thanks  on mon  jun 19  2017 at 2 54 am  junpeng lao  notifications github com  wrote

oh  true  we can add  cov whitenoise 1e 4   when we setup the cov function  in that case  this option seems not very necessary  thanks 
either way  it would be good to warn the user when an unused argument is passed  including for example passing   target_accept   or   nuts_kwargs    depending on the chosen implementation  to a step which does not use these arguments 
will do in a minute  +1 
thanks for checking  sorry i haven't thought of that shape problem  probably  it would be a nice practice of coding just to define the shape parameter everywhere  so that possible errors could be avoided
hi  ericmjl   thanks for the response  to clarify  i only pip installed from github while troubleshooting this  since i was no longer able to install from pypi  it seems like this was an issue with cache i had for pymc3  pip installing with    no cache dir  worked  but i still had issues with pip stalling for other purposes until i cleared out my cache  i guess it was just a coincidence that it was consistently an issue with pymc3  this can be closed 
so  changing the prior on  p  to  pm halfnormal  ended up making the model run for me as well  thank you for spotting the error  fonnesbeck  that said  the fact that two completely unrelated errors show up for what is a statistical model issue can lead others astray as it did me  even though the basic problem of setting a negative period is obvious in hindsight  it eluded me because i kept thinking this was some technical issue going on with theano in the background  as   _both_   of those errors usually imply   at any rate  from this i've learned to keep an open mind and be more rigorous with my code in the future 
done  this is my first pull request to a shared project 
hi ken ichi  thanks for the quick reply   1  regarding indication   i was thinking more along the lines of adding a red asterisk to show that a field is required  right now  when a custom field is required it is marked with a red asterisk  when non custom field is required  no indication whatsoever   2  when directly adding an observation from the project page   2 1  user clicks add observation on project page  2 3  user does not fulfill requirements  2 4  observation is saved but not added to project  link shown to edit project   2 5  user edits project to fulfil requirements  2 6  but upon saving  the observation is not added to the project so i was thinking of maybe keeping the users within the project somehow so they don't have to manually add the observation to the project upon fulfilling a requirement 
i meant the custom observation fields  i e  user would be able to create fields that accept multiple items via checkboxes

ah ha  i see what you mean  i don't have strong feelings about how it is resolved if the end result is expected behavior of cids  i e  going to the finest level of agreement  
the only think i can think of is that last week it was brought to my attention there were several places in inat named cedar ridge preserve located in dallas texas  usa  when i set up the project there wasn't a place in inat named cedar ridge preserve in dallas tx and so i had to create the place   taught myself how to do the boundaries and everything       i was getting complaints from people  newbies  who were trying to navigate around for the first time and kept going to the wrong place  named cedar ridge preserve in dallas texas   and not finding the project  never mind that there is a project tab at the top of the page and they can "search" for the project    sigh   not wanting anyone to become frustrated and quit    i merged all the cedar ridge preserves in  dallas texas locations into one place   there is only one cedar ridge preserve in dallas tx  and by doing so i unknowingly created a whole new problem  i am going to say that i am the cause of the problem    lol thank you    i know just enough to be dangerous        deborah
reeeahheeheeelly  oh  jeez  i never noticed that  it would be nice if the ids got an id icon and mentions and comments got the speech bubble  however  if that's a huge pain  i'd say we just get rid of them 
the second list looks much better  most of the languages listed are in the japanese default a i u e o  ka ki ku ke ko  sa shi su se so  etc   order  however it gets complicated for the languages or words that use kanji  the other languages use the phonetic katakana  kana  syllabary  languages like "japanese"  "english"  "chinese"  and "korean" are written solely in kanji  and in this case computers will automatically sort this by a default order which generally goes according to how complicated the characters are  which is counter intuitive to people  generally the way around this is to have another field in which the name is written phonetically using katakana or hiragana  so that all items can be sorted according to the phonetic field  itunes and other software use this as well  i'm not too sure of how difficult it would be to add another phonetic field for automated sorting  this would prevent a person from having to manually input orders  this phenomenon also happens on other parts of the site   choose locations  including country names   and even the listing of taxa when browsing classification trees  as far as i can see the taxa are all organized alphabetically by the scientific name  and i believe this is an international standard though  so with regards to taxa  this could be kept as is  i'd be happy to help out on this if you need anything else just let me know 
no reports yet  i can take this down until we do but wanted to have a repository for it 
looks like they're not being "recorded" as reviewed  but the "reviewed" box is checked  1  go to identify  2  click on the first observation and bring up the modal  3  click on "reviewed" to mark as reviewed  4  go to the next observation  the "reviewed" box is already marked  5  however  if you get out of the modal  you'll see that the second observation has not been marked as reviewed  was able to replicate in both safari and chrome  haven't tried ff 
oh that’s fantastic  i didn’t look hard enough  i was referring to pages with photo metadata like  https   www inaturalist org photos 54547699
apparently this is due to the fact that moarvm is being compiled with a version of glibc that is more modern than what's available in the default repositories  is that correct   also  maybe i should move this issue to moarvm 
setting mvm_spesh_inline_disable 1 seems to resolve the problem  i e  mvm_spesh_nodelay 1 mvm_spesh_blocking 1 mvm_spesh_inline_disable 1 perl6lib lib    
using index to find the newlines and greater than symbols the sequence for nr gz is correct  see below  thankfully perl6 looks pretty much like c when we need it to      using perl6 generating sufficient data to reasonably mimic the structure takes longer than just downloading nr gz in the background 
it is difficult to show something without entering a whole program  but the next example shows a stack dump  which is indeed what i would like  but also the message   moarvm panic  internal error  unwound entire stack and missed handler    more often than not  i get this error without any explanation   the modules used from my gnome    projects are sometimes a bit complex  i am not very sure that deep down in gnome  n where the native subs are called  exists a problem where i try to handle exceptions and rethrow them again  regards  marcel
i don't think 2020 02 1 has the problem  as you can see from the 'expected behavior' section  2020 02 1 works fine  what i think has the problem is version 2020 05 which doesn't have a precompiled  offical  version yet

oh  "  i missed that one   thanks for the heads up 
this is the script    php
sorry  you're correct there is a problem in framework i use not in the twig 
it adds the template but the loader wont find it  as it sees the   at the beginning when used and tries to search the namespace 
hi the url is https   github com bobthecow twig html mode git it is more of just a syntax highlighter at present but still helps  have you used coda 
this is simply to remove this 2 lines  and consequently the indentation created by them    a solution could be to not have a block content  but a   special variable    child_content  including the child without extends  and in this case  the boolean option for the block would be always usefull   this option could be too usefull in a debug context  if you want not see a special block just adding a false  would be a speedly solution than comment an entire block   to respond to your question more precisily  the birth of this idea is in symfony    my solution   for the moment   is a personal bundle which rewrite the content at the end   like the profiler   and apply a layout    in fact my solution is maybe good  but just one layout isn't enought  and make the tests necessaries to define layout in a proper way make me affraid  where  how  on what   as i want to be more close to symfony standard  i search a solution in twig  but if i can  i would prefer to not rewrite all forms with a content block 
thanks  it does  but i still think that twig should not behave this way  maybe the twig developers would want to fix that 
my version is 1 14 2  got it with latest symfony2   i've checked your code  it works exactly as expected  in my case i have two independent loops for the same entity  i expect that every loop should have independent loop index but it's not like this  i can use workaround  but it's not good practice  i think     set loopindex    1       for item in form items       set loopindex   loopindex + 1   
well  the template looks a little special  just think away the double points   as i'm using two of my custom modules for pyrocms that makes it possible to use twig for the templates  as lex  honestly  isn't very usable   here's the module  https   bitbucket org getunik pyrocms twig module  clients is an array with  well  clients  if clients only contains one array inside an array  with index 0   than the array with index 0 that contains the array with the values  is changed by twig into a one dimensional array  of course that makes that array loop over the values and output empty lis inside the loop 
 brandonkelly i thought that already happened   
 1emming  is    if param   0        else        endif        param    not tags   spaces should be removed between them not just only for html tags  otherwise spaceless is useless 
for example  in template    username line   custom filter   line_filter   new twig_simplefilter 'line'  function   string  length   20       here i would like to get the variable name  "username" in the example above       thanks  frank
well technically even symfony's twig integration is optional  before 3 0   not sure where to draw the line exactly 
i would expect that the template name would be "mybundle default index searchform html twig"

ah  that may be it  i am using an interface called "yosemite"  i got it from https   github com mikker yosemiteinterface qsplugin https   github com mikker yosemiteinterface qsplugin i just checked their issues and i see that this has been reported  last year    but they don't have a solution yet  maybe i should just change the interface  thanks for the prompt response 
i think it worked fine a few days ago    it happens with every catalog source  and is repeatable 
 skurfer should've mentioned my awareness of that  i think i would prefer what i proposed  this is by no means a must have feature  just putting it out there 
hey  i just reset preferences and setup from the empty plug ins  and it works normally now 
i've tried with other pdfs  same problem  if the file is configured to open with skim  then i can open it with skim using "file → open with"  otherwise  i can't  how do i check my file system handler 
ok spotlight does it  but i disabled spotlight completely  because it's some kind of cpu consuming and quite not as high performance as quicksilver  so i would really like to see quicksilver as complete alternative for apotlight  just my 2 cents   
no luck  i completely deleted quicksilver  using appcleaner   emptied my trash  downloaded a fresh copy from the qsapp com site  got the previous one somewhere else   launched and was taken through a "welcome" dialog series i hadn't seen before  perhaps due to remnants of my long ago previous version qs installation    and now qs seems to be running with the minimal default set of plug ins and etc  i'm going to extend very slowly and carefully  to see whether there's any particular catalog addition or plug in or trigger or whatever that causes problems  but with luck  i'm out of the woods  thanks for the suggestion  i'll comment again if i learn anything more 
quicksilver preferences tell me i'm using  lucidagrande 48 0   i don't believe i've ever changed the font intentionally 
i built using the instructions from http   qsapp com wiki building_quicksilver  i first built quicksilver distribution and the quicksilver  in xcode 4 2  from what i understood  the build process both builds it and installs it  anyway  i can run it without xcode  from the applications folder   and the problem still exists  as far as debug or release  xcode 4 doesn't seem to have this distinction  unless i am missing it 
i removed  or i think i do  i am not sure if the removal is completely clean  scfinderplugin  but the problem still persists  and i have been using macvim with no problem for some time now 
 pjrobertson  thanks for that tip  since when i went google chrome    other bookmarks i only saw the top level folders i had assumed i had to navigate them that way  i didn't realize i could start typing and it would search the whole tree  i learn something great about qs every week     still i think the general idea of catalogs that are not in the global index could be very handy   skurfer i do realize they will get better  but with 2600 bookmarks they really are overpowering everything else  and i search them enough that i would very happily give them their own trigger or at least an accelerator  #1062 is interesting  i will comment there  ps   ndreas has actually added chrome folders to the name also in the chrome plugin  so folks can search url title  url  and folder  pretty sweet   ndreas googlechrome qsplugin#10

 skurfer for me that command outputs the following 
i am running version 1 0  i don't see an upgrade button anywhere  does quicksilver have updating functionality yet  unfortunately  it doesn't look like i can recreate the crash 
i'm not following you  after their name where 
yes  it is checked  though i never look for urls  mostly just other files apps that have similar names   i've unchecked it and will see what happens  i have submitted numerous crash reports  though more recently i've been getting tired writing detailed comments of the same issue

that's a very good call  i have a bunch of triggers  disabling all and re enabling one at a time  it looks like my pmset_startup script is the culprit  the error is logged three times because it's assigned the same keystroke as two other triggers  the other two triggers are application specific and this one is global  so i would assume it's a problem with the scope of them all conflicting  however  disabling the other two triggers and leaving just the pmset_startup script still produces the error  though only once     screen shot 2014 05 27 at 11 17 47 pm  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7719079 3100382 a878e530 e616 11e3 81d4 5c18967b3331 png  the script itself generates a dialog to schedule a "wakeorpoweron" event from the date and time entered  i backup and automatically shut down every night  and the laptop is attached to a thunderbolt display in clamshell mode a lot of the time  this script keeps me from needlessly opening and closing my laptop every morning  just to hit the power button   any tip on how this can be cleaned up i would really appreciate  i'm sure this could be much better written  worst case though  i'll just ditch the trigger and assign it an abbreviation

quicksilver is behaving at the moment  i'll keep activity monitor open and see if i can catch it in the act    i'm not sure if i skipped over 1 2 x or not  the main thing i remember from the release notes is that the smart spacebar functionality was added  i update it whenever it asks  this was the first update in quite a while  over a year    i'm currently on 1 3 0

it freezes after running for a bit  no crash logs were available but i attached a resource dialog if that helps  by the way  the problem is also available in 1 5 1  i went back to that to see if it would work and it did not  nice app   keep up the good work  bob                                                                 robert j  rossana e mail  rjrossana gmail com address  dept  of economics  2074 f ab wayne state univ   detroit mi 48202 home page  clasweb clas wayne edu rossana                                                                
things i just tried    closing chrome  the count in the catalog decreases by one  i'm assuming for the main chrome app   and increases by one when i reopen chrome    opening lots of youtube tabs  no change   closing and re opening quicksilver  clears the list to a much more sane 9 entries    but i've done this to fix it before in the past and the issue invariably reoccurs    disabling and re enabling my extensions one by one  no change  interestingly  even though i currently have the usual 20ish google chrome helper processes in activity monitor  they aren't showing up in running applications   processes in quicksilver right now   i've clicked the rescan button   note that i don't  and haven't ever  had "include background applications" checked in qs

it basically has to do with our workflow for managing pull requests  roughly  1  check out target branch  2  fetch pull request branch  3  merge pull request branch into target branch  4  test  5  push  w o being able to use "fetch"  you end up needing to fetch pull the target branch  checkout the pull request branch  re checkout the target branch  merge  etc  obviously one could merge the target branch into the local checkout of the pull request branch  rather than the other way around    but then you can't easily push to the github target branch 
sorry for asking this a second time  i did not find the other issue when searching beforehand  for me  there are several reasons to want this    it is the obvious solution because github is  at least apparently  organized like this  the users of hub are familiar with having fork in separate repos directories  i consider myself a pretty experienced git user but the idea of handling forks as remotes did just occur to me after formulating this pull request  the subsequent thought was  whether someone has built a tool that adds all forks to a repo as remotes  could hub do that  perhaps with a subcommand       hub network init     it works quite well  most github repos are small so  having them checked out twice is not to much of a burden  on the other hand  people might want to keep them small and fast  if someone adds big content to their fork  one might not want to fetch that for performance and space saving reasons    git does it  not with the expanding of the github specific path of the url  but with the target path  note that else it would be a multi step process   that said  it might not be the best solution  after all  i guess  for most purposes  adding forks as remotes would work good enough  if not even better  some space could be saved by compression  keeping them up to date is easily done   git fetch   all    context  read  branch tag commit  switching could be done by  git   as it is supposed to  instead of via  cd   but what if two users have repos of the same name  that are not forks  everybody has their   me   dotfiles  and these are not at all desirable to be remotes of the same repo  one might want to have them both checked out and link contents to one's own   home  
an organization administration could delete the repo  it looks like it's indeed the issue you referenced 
it sounds like a tool for hub to me   my example was just a use scenario   it's my understanding that hub is a program for integrating github into git  which i believe this would fall under  a quick skim over the api doesn't seem to show that it is currently included  but i think it is something that will be  i'll throw in an api suggestion to the github guys as well 
this is an osx 10 9 mavericks system  the shell is bash 4 2 45  both the shell and hub were installed via  macports  http   www macports org

 mislav i've just read  here  https   github com sstephenson rbenv issues 306#issuecomment 11848374  and i think  for now  no need to go for system wide  there are things unclear about rbenv as system wide 
moving  fpath     zsh  fpath   to the top of   zshrc  has fixed it  one other question  is there any way to still use the git completion provided by one of the oh my zsh plugins  namely gitfast  the git completion that is now happening is slower and provides me with a load of different options for each tab complete i do  for example   git ch tab   offers up  checkout    check attr    check ignore    checkout index   etc  whereas gitfast's completion would just complete it to  git checkout  
bingo   mislav i also noticed ssh github com in the remotes  but didn't know to look in     ssh config   now  looking at     ssh config  at first i thought this test mac just had stale dotfiles  but then i found https   help github com articles using ssh over the https port     probably worth working to support this  but on the surface doesn't seem worth prioritizing  should i update the title and issue details 
the generated message seems to default to the commit message or something like that  which is a fine pull request message  i want to use that without opening a text editor so that i have one less step when sending a pull request using  hub   basically i would like the ability to send a pull without thinking about the message  either creating my own or editing the generated one   because the generated one is already good anyway 9 99 times out of 10 
i'll check this when i have time  let's close the issue until then

sure  if i run the command  hub checkout https   github com trevor vaughan  reponame  pull  pull_id   i get the following branch name  trevor vaughan  pull_id    now  if i want to use this name to figure out what the username is so that i can push back to it  i don't really have a good way of doing so  it's possible that i'm using  hub  incorrectly  but i'm mirroring functionality that i had when using  git review  with gerrit  the aliases that i'm using are as follows   pre  rd   " f     if    z  1    then echo 'must pass pull number'    exit 1  fi  origin_url  git config   get remote origin url   if    z  "  origin_url  "    then url  git config   get remote upstream url   else url  origin_url  fi  reponame  basename  url   hub checkout https   github com simp   reponame  pull  1     f" rf   " f     curbr  git rev parse   abbrev ref head   user  echo  " curbr "   cut  f1  d' '   branch  echo  " curbr "   cut  f2   d' '   if    z  user    then echo  "invalid user in  curbr "    exit 1  fi  if    z  branch    then echo  "invalid branch in  curbr "    exit 1  fi  git remote rm  user 2  dev null    true  hub remote add  p  user  git push  user head  branch  git checkout  branch    git branch  d  curbr     f "   pre  usage  1   git rd  pr_number      downloads the pr 1  hack on stuff 1   git rf     pushes the pr and cleans up the local branch if there's a better way of doing this  i'm certainly open to it 
i did notice a couple of   pullreq_editmsg   files  both in    git    and in the worktree dirs under    git worktrees     i think however  that at least _some_ of these exist because i was seeing bad info in the   pullreq_editmsg   and was pre emptively killing the tmux pane in which my editor was open to avoid opening a pr with the bad info in it  i've removed all of these   pullreq_editmsg   files and will continue to observe whether or not this problem re occurs  one potential explanation could be that hub was looking for    git pullreq_editmsg   when in a git worktree  i e    git worktree add            rather than in the worktree dir  before i opened this issue i noticed that there was a stale    git pullreq_editmsg    though i was too dumb to look at the contents before i deleted it  i almost exclusively work in git worktrees  so it is not out of the question for there to have been a stale   pullreq_editmsg   there for months without me noticing  i have a feeling that the cause of me forcibly killing vim to avoid opening a pr using a bad   pullreq_editmsg   may have been the fact that hub was still looking in    git    instead of    git worktrees worktree_name    however  i just tried to reproduce this by creating a dummy    git pullreq_editmsg   and then attempted to open a pr from a worktree and hub correctly created a new   pullreq_editmsg   in the worktree dir and ignored    git pullreq_editmsg    so  the stale   pullreq_editmsg   files in some of my old worktrees  which i should really clean out sometime  smile   may date from a time when there was a bug in an older release of hub  https   github com github hub issues 877 and https   github com github hub issues 928 are a couple that dealt with similar issues  the issue that caused me to open this bug report occurred in one of the rare times where i opened a pr from the "main" git clone  i e  not from a worktree   so the explanation of hub re using an existing   pullreq_editmsg   holds  since i _did_ find one there  however  side note  it might be a good idea for hub to treat   pullreq_editmsg   files older than n days as stale and disregard them  if this age were tunable  that'd be even better  like i said  i'll continue to keep an eye out  this may indeed be a relic of an older  since fixed issue  so you can feel free to close this if you like and we can re open if i find specific circumstances where a   pullreq_editmsg   is left behind after a pr is successfully opened 
that is exactly my problem   
hmm  i had a similar issue in another repository and did some more digging  you can overwrite the users  core autocrlf  settings for a repository in the   gitattribute  file  moreover you can do so by matching against patterns  therefore  all the    sh  files could be set to use the linux line endings regardless of the users global settings  i can't conceive of any user expecting to have windows line endings in a bash script file and it would allow the repository to build when people   like me   clone with silly settings 
 mislav this is how i believe it works and doesn't work currently  lets' say we have two repositories     a   original project    b   fork of  a  i work on a feature using  b   create a feature branch and push to remote  the feature branch is solely a branch of the fork  at this point i want to create a pull request for the original project  so i run my usual command hub pull request now  instead of getting pr for  a   i get the pr for  b  
this could be a flag for  git merge  and i should be able to configure it as default in my   gitconfig  file  if we mimic how  git branch   delete  works we should be able to make sure we don't delete the local branch in case i forgot to send changes from my local environment upstream 
i suspect that what happened with     config hub  is that i failed to properly authenticate at setup  i'm working on a new computer and i was installing hub anew  well  i don't know if that's the real cause  i had to authenticate a couple of times in a row because i have 2fa turned on and i failed to enter the code fast enough the first time  but again  that's just a guess 
installed through  brew    sure  i'll give the latest release a try 
ah  i see  making the argument for https   developer github com v3 pulls reviews #list reviews on a pull request for each pr on a huge list isn't quite wise right now  seeing that the list of users from this response should be melded with the list of "requested reviewers" for this to be complete  i would leave this open though  in hopes that the technology behind would better align in the future
git 2 19 0 macos 10 14b11  mojave   same issue with git and hub from master  i have no aliases for hub 
1  this is about using the hub command line tool to remotely decline pull requests 2  github webhook    jenkins    build  test  deploy  jenkins should be able to use the  hub  command line tool to decline the pull request if it fails during testing  3  good question  it would be very beneficial to be able to decide whether or not you want to close pr  ask for change  or accept the change  for my own use  i would probably only use it to request a change instead of closing the pr completely   mislav
haha thanks  the protocol was actually set to  git   strange  as i re installed arch linux from scratch and didn't tinker around at all with hub until two days ago when i noticed that cloning didn't work  thanks for helping me out  cheers 
i think yes please both thank you     for debugging purpose it is very helpful to get a message of missing scopes  since it is a pain to figure out  i read through the source code to figure it out  and yes  would be good if there was an auth login command  that could also be interactive the way that it is today the first time you run hub  i think it is fine to use  repo  as default  but it should allow a comma separated list of scopes you need  on wed  29 may 2019 at 20 37  mislav marohnić  notifications github com  wrote 
that would generally align with  git  conventions  i think    format  would be justifiable if there were at least a few symbols available  what might the use cases be   seems we could come up with quite a few   
#2197 suggested that the release operation could be atomic  so that the operation fails completely  which i think is the clearest workflow  in case someone want's to intentionally create a partial release   hub release edit  is still an option   i'm just thinking of scenarios where someone would favor a partial release  it's still good though to have point  1  implemented to verify that the data is accessible 
e g  by  docker run abergmeier hub 2 12 8 release      services like cloudbuild are entirely running on docker containers  thus this would be helpful 
my bad  it was a permission problem  didn't expect it to throw a 404 
i installed using the windows 64 bit package  any idea on how to uninstall if i used that method 
i tried go get github com github hub with go 1 14  still not work 
without checking much the code i guess use blob class instead of blobbuilder  i'll be good to check it out on other browser i think 
 mrrio no errors  the generated data will just be faulty  i e  stop at the first      like written in the op  will it work on your ff  i couldn't get it to work on any firefox near me  that being windows only  vista and 7  
doc fromhtml and i'm passing the html as string directly to it 
not that i experienced  if the line is not in  and you call output   twice  it will crash on the second call to output  
that works for inline  but there is no download like in chrome or firefox  the has to use "save as" or the built in viewer  works but the different behavior is confusing  is there a way to "force" the download in safari  regards
var canvas     "#mynetwork canvas"  get    var ctx canvas 0  getcontext "2d"   ctx fillstyle   '#ffffff'     or whatever color var imgdata   canvas 0  todataurl 'image jpeg'   var doc   new jspdf    doc addimage imgdata  'jpeg'  15  60  180  160   doc output 'dataurlnewwindow'  
 alexszilagyi   for me  the  baseurl  had to be        lib   so instead of writing  the latter makes jspdf use the exisiting  require_baseurl_override  value  instead of its default         
yeah   working on it  i think the problem may lie in a second round of requirejs optimization 
i have updated the issue description with the expected output 
sure thing  here it is  there is no css except for white background  font size  font family  and letter spacing on the divs for use on the canvases   example_pdf pdf  https   github com mrrio jspdf files 1026771 example_pdf pdf 
yeah it doesn't apply any css style but it just print the data as it is how it looks in browser but the styles are not applied while generating the pdf  
yes  here's a little example  although the behavior is really odd  you'll see you can reach the first page with a field  but not the next two  then again page 7 but not the next 2  and then finally page 10    const doc   new jspdf      index items for  var i   1  i   11  i++    doc textwithlink  page   i    10  15 i   pagenumber  i+1        pages for  var j   0  j   11  j++    doc addpage    if j   3      reachable pages doc text 10  25   reachable page   j+1       else   doc text 10  25   unreachable page   j+1        field const t   new window textfield    t rect    10  30  100  10   doc addfield t       return doc   
the project is very large  would it be enough to have the font files   fonts zip  https   github com mrrio jspdf files 2076334 fonts zip 
do we have any option to pass font size as parameter to gettextdimensions   and when ever iam doing gettextdimensions of multilinetext it is not giving the correct result   how should i use it for multiline text as i had a need to calculate previous text content and place the newer ones thanks for your speedy response  arasabbasi
ha   sorry i didn't know  thank you 
i don't have an algorithm unfortunately  what i came up with for the meantime for the x axis realigning is   this is nowhere near a normal algorithm and i really do wish it was supported  but for my specific case it worked ok  the y axis was less trouble so i didn't explore it more  that being said  the above method only solves my own specific scenario  if you want to support custom x y rotation origin  we need someone who understand this sort of stuff and knows how to calculate it 
no  i am not overwriting the _saveas_ method anywhere  is the one delivered with the jspdf library  i also tried to use _filesaver js_  but the same error occurred  from my point of view  i consider this flow closed  because there is a solution to the unwanted behavior mentioned in the first place  i only wanted to add a way of solving this for others that may encounter the same problem and if there are more robust or clean methods of solving it  then to be added to this thread 
i expect to see a black square

the convert2regexp has a switch statement  the switch statement is missing the case statement for " " because a " " needs to become "  " as is aleady done with " " already otherwise the pattern string "http   abc 3 " would become   http     abc  3

 ugisozols wrote  that is not really the correct answer  and here is the reason why  while it is true that refinery  plugins inherits array  the problem was occurring because the method was returning the result from calling array  select   that was yielding an array  not a refinery  plugins  that is why the code was broken    having said that    the version you have referred me to  1 0 9  addresses this issue by taking the array result from array  select and coercing it back into a refinery  plugins instance before returning it as the result of refinery  plugins  always_allowed  since the result object was coerced to refinery  plugins instance  the result object will be able to respond to the  names message  see how it was resolved in 1 0 9  https   github com refinery refinerycms commit 453f7500a276e0203188a1ac0be010963b9101f2 thank you for pointing me to that update

_"refinerycms devise authentication is a new gem created for 3 0+  there is no incompatibility before 3 0 because it's not used "_   but refinerycms "3 0" is since this merge incompatible with refinerycms version "3 0" revision e g  "6a57f0e5dfe82e03c3d27f8027c8da39704bd36c"  because of this i think  it should be next version

i tried going to as many of the dependencies and the only thing i could find that hooks into sprockets is the  sass rails  dependency in refinery  but there's no manipulation done on it  and internally it only cares about sass stuff   therefore  i tried something different   i renamed the  core app assets stylesheets application scss  to  core app assets stylesheets frontend_application scss  and tried adding that to the top level layout  which prompted that i add it to the assets initialiser's precomp list  and that worked  meaning sprockets has no issues in resolving manifests inside refinery  but any manifests defined outside of refinery  top level  are seemingly being ignored  and if i remove refinery  just from the gemfile   boom  those top level manifests start working  real head scratcher here  i'll set about generating a fresh rails 5 + refinery app to demonstrate this better

from what i can tell  i think it's this from the nested set library  https   github com collectiveidea awesome_nested_set blob 3838ceeb1ec2e3e9ac60b6707a981d6b37bb7cab lib awesome_nested_set model rb#l82

i have tried but i'm facing too much issue because there is many extension extend from engine 
there is only only one refinery  page or page period is called about_us  if i put in some debug output  you can see that there is some kind of circular calling between rails application routes draw draw   and refinery  core  engine routes prepend prepend    i'm not familiar with this kind of routing issue so i don't know if this circular calling is normally when booting rails and using prepend  i also don't know if the patten in the guide  4 3  is valid for refinerycms stable

hi  bricesanchez  i am sorry but i beg to differ  and to answer your question  yes i have read guides  i have a large experience running production systems on rails heroku  as far as i can see  the only way to push migrate content from a given environment  let's say staging   to a production environment is to basically dump the postgres db and override your production environment database with your staging one  in that case   and this of course is a big no no  way to risky to override an entire production db all at once  the only other solution i could see  would be to extract only the right data tables   rows form the staging postgres and push only those to production  but it will force us to gain a very strong understanding of how refinery is architectures and it's entire data schemas  which to be honest kinds of defeats the purpose of using an already built cms  i believe that it is relevant for a cms to address those concerns and they are shared by most of the organization deploying content into production  let me take an straightforward example that i have seen dozens of time across multiple companies that i have been involved with    you have a public front end with content to describe your application   you have been working at upgrading a significant portion of your application   and of course you want to prepare some new marketing content to advertise those new features the issue you face is that you most likely cannot start building those new content page in production as they would need to point to application page that don't exists yet  or embedded demo that are not yet live into production   however all those app pages you need for your marketing have already been deployed into a staging or pre production environment for weeks while you qa and uat are running  this is indeed the best place to start building those new marketing pages on your cms  as you will be able to test the pages end to end  and what you want to be able to do from there is to "select" those new pages on your staging cms and push them towards your production cms as this would be a much more trustworthy process than having some marketing intern re copy all those modifications made on staging to production  and of course  implicating your it team to override your entire production db is of course out of the question as you cannot guarantee that content has not changed at all on production  and anyways a db override would require downtime  which for many modern services are just unacceptable  so if you tell me that this is out of scope for refinery  i can accept that  but then i believe it would make refinery not suitable for a proper production environment  however if you have specific guides or approach in mind that i have not considered  i would very much appreciate a few pointers  thank you for your time 
as i understand  no  since modification of request headers needs to be done programmatically using javascript  flash  java  etc  these environments implement the "same origin policy" so that requests may only be sent to the same domain that the scripts are served from  here's some more info if you're interested  http   code google com p browsersec wiki part2#same origin_policy

i don't see a direct circular reference   i imagine that there are a couple of references that stop objects from being freed quickly but i can't see which they might be  anyhow you're probably right  relying on the reference counter probably isn't a good idea for this case  thanks for the response

i have read rfc and did not found any other http response code  which allow to respond  followed with premature disconnect  in any case  1  tornado should try to respond with something just before closing connection  2  tornado should set  connection  close     this will not hurt in any way 
in my setup  the following query is considered to be correct by nginx  but it raises _badrequestexception in tornado  with an empty response   there is obviously a typo in this request  and i'd like to answer the requester with a proper diagnostics  that the request contains a mistake  
if i'm in another thread  once the async operation finishes i'd like to get the data back to the thread  say using a blocking queue   however  if i can't tell that i'm on the other thread  then it's difficult to make that decision  currently  i am using add_callback   and doing the necessary bookkeeping necessary to determine these things  however  it seems like the type of thing that tornado should easily be able to provide  instead of each library user having to implement it themselves 
i have  gzip true  in settings and use  tornado web staticfilehandler   in 3 2 2 it responses with header  content encoding  gzip   but in 4 0 1 it responses without this header and related headers also  to set up server i use  tornado web application  and run it like so   i make requests for static files  e g    static app css  and expect content to be gzipped  instead it responses with regular content encoding  e g  text css

i appreciate the offer but no  i'm alright    i've just put everything into the root of the project and am no longer using   directory_indexes  for this project  _it's not a production site  just a quick way for me to generate front end markup when writing front end styles  js and html  so it's just a matter of generating accessible templates for cms integration _
yep  you got it  http   cl ly 28343s3b3745 i'm super inexperienced at reading these  but i'm wondering if frontmatter sideloading is making sitemap traversal way slower  i think i can confirm  if i check out a0445e4  my build time is 1 36 30  which is  30 secs longer than 3 0 14 but still probably acceptable  jumping ahead one commit to 0574cc3 spikes build time to 3 21 05  the biggest difference that i can see  assuming i'm reading the profiles right  is that  middleman  coreextensions  frontmatter  resourceinstancemethods#ignored   now checks the frontmattermanager to see if  ignore  was set there  and this seems to be super slow  mostly inside  frontmattermanager#frontmatter_and_content

i'm not sure how to upload it  so i'll post the contents of some files  i need my links to be relative and because the navigation is located in the one layout shared across all html pages  it gets confused depending on what page is open  the navigation works ok on the root index html  but then gets all lost on the other pages  css has been problematic too  the link problem persists whether or not i turn on relative assets  this app seems to address the issue  https   github com mdub pith#readme  can middleman work similarly  should i use a different template language  here is the layout haml  notice i tried two different things in the ul li  
yes  i had a second middleman running  that was it  thank you 
i started from the html5 template  see below    i did have a quick look at the default template but did not realise it had a different javascript directory   doh

apologies  the server i was testing on was affected by the linux leapsecond bug  man  and i thought i had sorted them all out   middleman uses futexes internally which triggers the bug  but it is not a bug in middleman  if anyone stumbles over this ticket in the near future  this command fixes your server 
sorry   tdreyno  i'm new to github  so i could not figure out how to add pull request to this issue 
weird  i am using mm 3 0 using the compass retina sprite generator https   gist github com 2878758 if you reference a sprite that does not exist  compass sass with exit with error  and the error will be in the output css file 
it seems that ctrl c is just ignored  nothing happens  there is information that middleman is started and information about used port and cursor is blinking  i press ctrl c and everything remains the same then refresh the browser and get compiled pages  when i close the shell and refresh the browser i get not found page  server is shut down 
### config rb
mr reynolds  neither of those seem to work but i'm probably doing something obviously stupid  i'm running 3 0 1   of mm  if i use      link_to 'source code'  ' downloads html'   class    'main link color five'  "data icon"    'd' do      end     here is the error  truncated the paths slightly for brevity  
ah thanks  didn't know about about  debug_assets  awesome  i'm using os x  10 8 2   ruby 1 9 3  whatever js environment is the default  execjs i believe from looking at gemfile lock   so far my project has this many files  15 javascript files  libraries like jquery  etc  71 coffeescript files  backbone views  models  collections  27 eco templates  coffeescript templates  4 scss files 2 erb templates yeah  it compiles the files only on request  rails appears to do the same   doesn't watch files  but in middleman if an asset hasn't been modified  it still recompiles it on the next request  whereas rails doesn't do that and just serves the already compiled version  in fact  with  debug_assets turned on  it's slower again  as i can see each file compile and load one by one in chrome web tools 
and this not help for me  now middleman work without any errors  but images not load and browser don't display errors 
after some hours of trials i've found that in rails is  b in padrino is  h in sinatra is  o in rack is  h so in middleman is  h

 tdreyno i get the same error when using ruby 2 0 0 p247  i also attempted the removing the gemfile lock thing and running again  i wonder if there is maybe a conflict with one of the dependent packages for ruby  for example  when i run ruby install  i immediately get four warnings   i wonder if the versions installed are incompatible  possibly  with my ruby installation 
 item  is set in the first haml line  by the  do  loop
 tdreyno indeed this is only happening on 4 1 12 for me 
yeah  like  lolmaus noted  it would be nice to move the   cache  directory into my   tmp  directory  i realize it's not a huge concern anymore  but i like to minimize the writes to my ssd if possible  thanks for letting me know it's done by  middleman sprockets  though 
 bhollis thanks for explaining  i following a link from an old issue and was looking at an old version of the default helpers  instead of the most recent  sorry for bringing this non issue up 
i had to rename my partial files to use  _  doh 
perfect  thanks 
you’re the boss  but i think the least invasive way would be to support  relative   argument in the rest of asset helpers and it would not break old projects and old project code  but new unified extension is more elegant  a candidate for v4 change  the main point is that projects which need to be relative in general  require sometimes an exception to pass  relative  false  argument to link   and   asset helpers  to properly build error pages 
that's the problem  there is no bug  i get no errors in the build but the loop returns empty  if i force an amount onto the array returned with  0   9  it works but that's not really scalable  very odd  on tue  13 jan 2015 at 05 28 thomas reynolds notifications github com wrote

tested 4 different scenarios  just in case   with the same results  argumenterror    ruby 2 2 0   middleman 4 1 10   ruby 2 2 0   middleman 4 1 12   ruby 2 3 0   middleman 4 1 10   ruby 2 3 0   middleman 4 1 12 the weird thing is that i can  get stuff done   accents won't stop me   by following the trick of emptying the data files just before launching the server  so maybe there's one check that is i'm happy to help testing whatever is needed  it sucks a bit that my coding skills are a bit limited 
having used middleman a bit more over the past few days its now clear to me that  middleman server  is "development" and  middleman build  is "build" but at the time it was not obvious to me how the the development section of the config file would ever be reached  i had been exclusively using  middleman build  and i looked at the help of  middleman build  and there was nothing in there about switching environments  i eventually discovered  mm_env  and it seemed like that should be documented  documenting mm_env doesn't seem necessary anymore  but i think it would be useful to add a sentence to that section to reiterate that  configure  development     gets run by default when  middleman server  is used and  configure  build     gets run by default when  middleman build  is used

http   dank bengler no   page show 5473_connectinggrbl if you look at this page it's kinda confusing there is seems like the serial port is occupied  i wish the documentation was a little clearer and there was a pins h in the code so you could assign your own pins  guess i'm spoiled from reprap software  terramir
no problem  i will try to answer your questions in english    derfrickler you are right  the software is written in qt with opengl  we wrote it for windows  so for some features some has to impelement the linux or mac details  but this shoud be easy for a linux or mc user  the board on the pictures is our only prototype  we added more features to the pcb as grbl needs  like a sd card and several digital and analog inputs and outputs  in next time  we have to check this new functions at possible errors  if all of this is checked we will order more of the pcbs   blinkenlight for the new version of the xmega firmware  we used grbl 8 0  until today  we prorted about 90  of the whole grbl code to the new controller  we only have to implement the code for the limit switches 
i'm using ugs 1 07    open device   send  x   jog z down 25mm per press   default settings  except softlimits is on    works until  200   then
the nist spec  pdf  http   citeseerx ist psu edu viewdoc summary doi 10 1 1 15 7813 does not actually mention 28 1 and 30 1  so maybe it's a linuxcnc specific way of setting those positions  the only thing the linuxcnc spec says is "g28 1   stores the current absolute position into parameters 5161 5166 " i guess my point is that adding parameters to the g28 1 call should not cause the machine to move  whether it silently ignores the parameters or throws an error doesn't really matter  but unexpected machine movement is never a good thing 
indeed  the nist g code standard says only the name of the plane  xz  it doesn't say anything about the order  i think the right hand rule must be followed here  g17  x  y goes to the z direction  thus x  y  z g18  z  x goes to the y direction  thus z  x  y g19  y  z goes to the x direction  thus y  z  x with the emc2 generated gcode files the grbl produces the xz arcs correctly only when the order is z  x  y  that's why i opened this issue

i was gone most of the day today  but i did write  or rather modify  an arduino code that simply receives a serial string and then echoes it back with an "ok" afterward to simulate the responses from grbl  i will describe in detail how the arduino code works  1   the arduino detects a serial event and reads a single character and buffers it in a string variable  2   the above is repeated until a " n" is detected 3   once the  n is detected  the stored string has " echo  " put on the front  and " " put on the back to simulate the grbl response 4   the string is then sent using the serial println   command 5   an additional serial println "ok"  command is used to simulate the grbl "ok" response here is an example of the first few lines of a 10 000 line g code file followed by what was returned  stripped of the " echo  " and " "  g01g21g90x 0 5375y3 5375z3 3598f4000 x3 8999z1 0234 x3 896z1 0262 x3 8645z1 0475 x3 8566z1 0527 x3 8212z1 0742 g01g21g90x 0 5375y3 5375z3 3598f4000 x3 8999z1 0234x 3 896z1 0262x 3 8645z1 0475x 3 8566z1 0527x3 8212z1 07 42 i also found that i can eliminate all errors whether using the arduino test code or grbl firmware and using either character counting or send response  by inserting a small delay into the loop that sends data to the arduino  a delay in the arduino test code does not eliminate the errors  also  as requested by  chamnit   changing the steps mm in grbl doesn't affect whether errors are generated  but changing the max rate does  the steps mm would affect the grbl code  but not how fast grbl needs to stream the data  changing the max rate will however affect how fast data needs to be streamed  so the errors are tied to how fast the arduino needs to get data from the serial stream  also  using a code with realistic move lengths eliminates errors  also indicating that the streaming speed is the issue  based on getting the errors using either grbl firware  or using the arduino test code  i believe the problem is related to the arduino hardware i have  all of my testing has been with arduino clones  not with genuine arduinos  i plan to get a genuine arduino uno in the future to see if the same holds true for the genuine arduinos  but it may be a while before i can get one  it seems that the delay required is also dependent on the baud rate i choose  for some baud rates using send response  i don't need any delay for them to work correctly  for other baud rates  a delay is needed even with send response  but only a very small one  1 to 2 milliseconds   for character counting  all baud rates need this delay  but some only need 1 2 milliseconds while other baud rates need about 5 6 milliseconds  and yet others don't ever work right  i do want to point out though that just because grbl doesn't throw an error doesn't mean there isn't one  for example  my previous post highlited one example where a mismatch in what was sent and what grbl echoed back did not register an error from grbl because the line was still in proper g code format  but the coordinate value was wrong  some of the errors i have found were only discovered by using code that does a line by line comparison of the grbl echo to the original g code 
grbl 0 9 and the gui is the grblpanel  i'm using cambam as a cam software with their post processor  would coinverting arcs to lines be a better approach 
hi  sorry    i try to explain  the issue is that i send the homing command  then z moves as expected  then only y seeks for the end switch  after it is found both  x and y are moving to the pull off position   1mm in my setup  this has the effect that x is traveling 1mm away every time i send  h  hope this explains the situation
for example when i send the g38 2z 15f10 command  the z axis move starts at 10mm min  but it stops always at 1 889mm from start point  on wed  nov 18  2015 at 11 31 am  sonny jeon notifications github com wrote  ##     por favor  no me envíe documentos adjuntos en formato word o powerpoint  lea http   www gnu org philosophy no word attachments es html

think i've sorted it now  wiped my arduino and reinstalled grbl 1 1f using the hex file and x loader  now it lets me set  32 to 1 without the error 
arduino 1 8 9 my grbl is in c user pc documents arduino libraries  grbl is adding through add zip library in arguing ide  c program files x86  arduino libraries  this is the location of where my arduino and others example such as blink    and default libraries are  i have two grbl file another is under grbl_master which is in this pc  downloads
sure  makes sense to me to limit the results for now  thanks   kparal  any comments about sorting taskotron tasks output 
hmm  maybe this is related to #655 then  i tried to edit the update but i was unable to  one of the things i wanted to do was add an updated build for this package  eclipse 4 5 1 2 fc22  but bodhi did not let me
yes  should be clear from the log i guess  "lkundrak edited this update  new build s "
just tried it and my browser is okay and i got the preview  so i guess it's good  however  i discovered another issue    https   github com fedora infra bodhi issues 677
thank you much 
i think pr #1227 will solve this one too    so  i don't think i will have to make any other changes in that 
i tried this on 0 5  downloaded the latest tarball from master  and it didn't seem to work  still runs as settings

that's a good question  '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0' was the remote_addr value from google chrome when running run_gunicorn under django 1 3  i presumed that gunicorn had evaluated the ipv6 address but maybe you're right  can an ipv6 address be in the remote_addr field even if the server is only using ipv4 
 benoitc  you're writing to maraujop  right  btw  i'm using gunicorn 0 12 1   if you want i can try the last head
i don't know which one is the right      is  hubs use_hub    required and if  does it need to come before or after  patch    
johnny cache is a caching layer  http   packages python org johnny cache  i think the problem is maybe the combination of memcache on another server and a faulty network switch  in the meantime i've updated the linux running on the server  was an ubuntu 8 04 machine  and replaced the switch  gunicorn is running stable in sync mode now  i'll retest async mode in the next days 
no  i didn't kill the old master  thank you for your response  now it is clear to me the  usr2  workflow of  gunicorn   closing the issue    
the app could boot up if i use   manage py run_gunicorn  but not with gunicorn_django  w 2  any idea  and are they equally the same 
sorry  that was a very uninformative bug report  the problem is that if you're using unix domain sockets the client address is an empty string and therefore attempting to get items from it triggers an indexerror 
some sort of file not found error  the file it is attempting to open using the file descriptor doesn't exist 
sorry  i don't understand the question 
i see  yes  it is    i don't want to change resource into others  can we override it in gunicorn 
i run it from a command line as "gunicorn package app"  i tested it on both osx and ubuntu and got the same error on both platforms 
 benoitc i'm using archlinux 
that would at least preserve the python2 behavior  i don't know if there's an encoding that might break if split on space  i guess not 
as it now runs on my dev server  vagrant nginx supervisor gunicorn django   when it stopped using django_wsgi py there is no import problem and this app registry problem  i had bad settings name in django wsgi py and django debug toolbar which caused weird errors  like no urlpatterns in urls   when i fixed the settings name  removed all ddt config package  installed django 1 7a2 gunicorn works without problems 
i did not send any signal to master  it just killed the worker after a while  but i tested gunicorn the app as a deamon process  and then the worker had not been killed any more 
sorry  benoitc for wasting your time  the problem wasn't in gunicorn  i found out that i had missed one of init scripts that launches everything 
  run_gunicorn sh # shell script ending with gunicorn   daemon ps aux # no sign of any gunicorn or python process if it makes any difference i am starting up 8 pretty heavy workers on an undersized aws instance  when it works  about half the time with the current setup  i can see 8+1 processess 
thank you for looking into it  my ini is like this   starts "main"  with that line commented out  "socksrv" is started correctly 
the build tries to make  pyc  pyo for this file and fails  the  py file is still installed  however  and will probably fail at runtime if it's ever used  
i didn't check the content length  the file is served with flask static system so i figured it should be ok  i'll check that try to revert tonight  10 15 hours from now  and i'll let you know 
i am deploying omero web from https   www openmicroscopy org site support omero5 2 sysadmins unix server centos7 html this will start server and web application  instead of going to the section _running omero_ try the following   then you would need to import few larger image files http   www openmicroscopy org site support omero5 2 users cli import html#command line importer     importer cli  s localhost  u public  w secret image tif   i tested with 3gb files  you can brows through files on http   host webclient   once you click on image on the right hand panel you will see download icon   icon_download2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1065155 12514375 fd2b1dec c11a 11e5 997f 33a6d8af31b4 png    this will trigger  http   host webgateway archived_files download image_id   let me know if you need any help with the deployment or ui  i hope that won't be painful     my impression is that this is exactly the same problem as https   github com benoitc gunicorn issues 588
i originally used requests  but i replicated it using just urllib2  this is with python 2 7   it does not happen when running the same code in flask directly  so it is clearly only when in a gunicorn environment  it also goes away when using eventlet instead of sync threads  as the stackoverflow thread suggests  there's no log in gunicorn other than the thread being killed when it times out  the httplib log also shows nothing other than the request going out  and then the read timeout firing  if i set a timeout in requests  the read timeout fires after that duration  the remote log shows a request coming in fine  and then returning with a 200  if i make the request from the command line  of my machine or the machine hosting the server code   everything runs and returns fine  the only environment in which the error occurs is when the server is running gunicorn with the sync setting 
using falcon it's  append_header 'x rate limit'  123   in 19 4 x it works
in the linked issue there was some code  https   github com benoitc gunicorn issues 1330#issuecomment 268438572 either it never got into the main tree  or it was removed 
would a better approach be to just add an "abbreviate" setting to the existing functionality  that would make the proctitle format be either "gcn mst  proc_name " and "gcn wrk  proc_name " when set  or is it better to just add a "don't annotate" option that makes the process name exactly what the user specifies with no details added at all by gunicorn 
yeah  i guess i could do that as a workaround  thanks for the pointer  would you agree that customizing time without need for custom  logger_class  would be a nice feature  though 
i have this in mi procfile  web  gunicorn  k eventlet main app and the eventlet is working fine with the patch  if i write  w 1 in that line  the server goes down  only see the issue when the server socketio is working with the java socketio web client  thanks for answer 
yes it is using a volume  i just updated my original question with the docker compose file  i don't know what is the cause of the issue  i don't know how to reproduce it  what else can i provide you with  do you think you might need the source code of my django app 
when i run  sudo service gunicorn start     error    start job fail to start 
thanks for your reply tilgovi  these logs occur when the site is not being accessed  i am wondering why gunicorn would show me log entries once every 2 seconds if the site is not being accessed  thanks
all workers do this upon receiving the usr1 signal    def handle_usr1 self  sig  frame   self log reopen_files    the reopen_files   function in glogging will then do this   with self lock      this is most likely the culprit 
config is stored in a  yaml  file and loaded as a dict in my  appconfig py   then i start gunicorn with  gunicorn  c appconfig py  my  appconfig py  is something like
i am unable to identify the source of hup signal  but somehow gunicorn receives it from somewhere and gets restarted  i am unable to find a way for graceful closure  it just kills anything that is running and simply restarts 
somehow  i'm now using the js externally from github instead of the one contained in the flask application  this is a workaround but has the merit to work so far 
previously i have tried several times in my local development environment，which is the same application code with production environment，but i can't reproduce it  and i have checked version 19 9 0 release log，not found something related，i'll keep watching this error log，if find something new，i would post here 
anything to add for now  it works using gevent worker and i haven't had much time to do more research on why or how 
just try starting gunicorn with the    log config dict  option and some argument  it will always fail   there's no way to pass a  python dict  from the shell  you can only pass a string  and the code in gunicorn isn't setup to do the conversion from the string representation of the dict to the python dict object 
thanks for your help  unfortunately i'm not skilled enough yet to submit any pr   just found that eventlet and gevent workers expose all required metrics  so this issue is really related to tornado only 
oh  sorry for missing that information  thanks for reminding me  it's  gunicorn 19 9 09  and  gevent 1 3 7  
yes  workers time out 
python version   i'll take a look at the link 
 berkerpeksag i am writing a cli app which queries api server  nginx + gunicorn gthreads  + falcon  for results  i would like to stop processing requests on the server when the user kills cli call using ctrl+c or ctrl+z  i thought there are two ways  1  add signal hooks ctrl+c z  to cli app and call a cleanup endpoint to stop request processing and upstream db tasks  but  with this approach  i can't get the thread where the request is being processed  2  somehow catch client disconnects on the server side to stop processing client requests  i have tried connectionabortederror  but it is not raised when client connection closes or pipe break  do you have any other thoughts to resolve above issue  thank you 
 tilgovi my code snippet is as follows  from multiprocessing import process model_dic     server route ' modelmanagement'  methods  'post'   def modelmanagement    id args "id"  model_dic id  process target mymodel args  id   model_dic id  start   when receiving a request with a new modelid  i will start a new process  it works without gunicorn framework  but it doesn't work using gunicorn  that's my question  thank you for your reply 
sorry  should have mentioned that  19 9 0  python 3 6 8 on ubuntu 18 04 
 benoitc thanks  i'm looking how to port my  tornado  app to gunicorn  and the most closer example i have found was this custom application  slightly modified to run a  flask  app  maybe a  multiapp  could be more appropriate for my case 
this is what my service looks like  unit  description gunicorn instance to serve myproject after network target  service  user root group root workingdirectory  root form_builder environment "path  root form_builder  county_form bin" execstart  root form_builder  county_form bin gunicorn   workers 10   access logfile  root form_builder logs gunicorn access log   error logfile  root form_builder logs gunicorn error log   log level warn   timeout 3600  b 0 0 0 0 8001   limit request line 0   limit request field_size 0   statsd host localhost 8125 county_form wsgi application  install  wantedby multi user target
in my code  i have a  request stream exhaust    which only works when  request stream  returns a  werkzeug wsgi limitedstream    but  request stream  returns a  gunicorn http body body  when i use gunicorn 20 0 4   so i get the python error   'body' object has no attribute 'exhaust'   interestingly this issue   happens only in   docker   containers   both python 3 8 slim buster and python 3 7 slim buster 
ok step 1  specflow loads the page step 2  specflow checks that  div id "target"    is visible step 4  specflow changes  select    value    javascript changes  div id  "target"    visibility spet 5  specflow is unable to check visibility change
i think getting something in to return at least a string is a great start quick fix  something as simple as

yes  this happens during runtime  this is happening when i run the test on a remote test agent as part of an automated process so i'm not actively debugging it  i don't get the exception when i run the test locally because the dependencies exist on my local development machine  the generated  trx  file doesn't have the  loaderexceptions  details  calling   tostring    on the  reflectiontypeloadexception  doesn't include the  loaderexceptions  details  if i setup a remote debugging session  i'm sure i can examine the  loaderexceptions  property  but requiring a debug session to examine the value of that property to diagnose the exception isn't ideal  in my case  microsoft visualstudio testtools uitest extension silverlight dll  was missing from the test agent and i just had to install  microsoft visual studio 2015 coded ui test plugin for silverlight  https   marketplace visualstudio com items itemname atinbansal microsoftvisualstudio2015codeduitestpluginforsilve   i had to retrieve the value of the  loaderexceptions  property to get the information i needed to resolve the issue

 samholder you mean that  afterscenario  tagged method always run and then  afterscenario "enable_network_connection"   tag method runs  i thought if i have  afterscenario "enable_network_connection"   tagged which has scenario tagged like  enable_network_connection scenario  check for network simulation when           then            if below method i want to skip  afterscenario  public void afterscenario       the suggestion you have given is like again check inside this method  my worry is if i am tagged scenario for some purpose it should call only tagged method in my case like  afterscenario "enable_network_connection"   public static void enablenetworkconnection     enablenetowrk      it should not call    afterscenario  public void afterscenario        
sorry for the late response  yes  the mstest adapter works with coded unit tests 
preferably  i'd like to see it in the main nuget package in the tools directory  for example  in specflow 2 2 0 preview20161020 nupkg  if not that one the maybe it makes more sense in the custom plugin nuget package  thanks for considering making this change 
yes  we are using specflow+runner  1 3 0   and would like to use the same  installed nunit package as well to try with this 
we have it in extension and updates   vs 2012 and when i search for spec flow in my vs 2012  in extensions  i don't see 2 1
hi  sabotageandi   i edited the issue and added the screenshots  hope it helps
here is a sample project i have been using to identify the issue   https   github com aptester specflowsamples
 gasparnagy the dll i got from nuget do not match your pdbs  i have the same stack trace  i retried with the last source in the repo  i still have null reference exception but not at the same place   even if it solves the same problem  the root cause is not the same because the stack traces are very different  so i can't say if it is a good solution 
i did paket install  but forget add paket references file into the project  but now i have "generation error  object reference not set to an instance of an object " problem  i see techtalk specflow reference item  but couldn't compile solution  i think need to do something with paket 
adding the  example config  http   specflow org documentation configuration   seems to resolve the issue   thank you for your quick response 👍
https   github com executeautomation specflowseleniumparallel tree master specflowparalleltest this project for example  it's similar  if you add  assembly levelofparallelism 3   and add one scenario in one of the features  to have 3 scenarios   they will not run all in parallel  it will run 2 and then another one 
well that does not allow me to send a message  plus it triggers the downstream processing    public void pending     throw new pendingstepexception        if i can get to  ierrorprovider  from a step class then it should be possible to bypass the behavior  if i throw my own pendingstepexception then execution continues and i end up with a bunch of downstream failures  plus i'd trigger the downstream processing  ideally i just want to stop execution so that the failure is easy to spot vs having a bunch of additional downstream failures

ah thanks for the tip  i have this fuslog entry  it looks like it is trying to find log4net in the jetbrains folder for some reason  i suppose i can drop log4net in there and see what happens  but that is a workaround and not a fix for other devs in my group if i want to include these tests  any suggestions   sorry about the formatting  can't seem to fix the bold text  
yes  i'm using 15 8 1  my project was building and running with vs2017  i didn't check the msbuild version  i will check it
interesting  it looks like running  dotnet vstest console dll specflowproject1 dll  platform x64  from the  bin release netcoreapp3 1  folder does work  i had a look at the logs for this and it looks like it is still not able to resolve that assembly  but for some reason it is not failing on that in this case   what's even more interesting is that this doesn't seem to work on a machine that doesn't have the  net core sdk installed  we're trying to run the tests in our qa environment from a machine that only has the  net core runtime installed and even when i use the contents of the  bin release netcoreapp3 1  folder on that machine it still fails with the same error  installing the  net core sdk on the machine doesn't seem to make a difference though  so it is definitely flaky behaviour 
i'm using the latest  3 0 169 beta version of specflow from nuget  https   www nuget org packages specflow 3 0 169 beta   how do i obtain the preview package  is this in reference to the  public preview  https   specflow org 2018 specflow 3 public preview now available    i assumed this was visual studio specific  which i'm not using 
hey andi   we are using the default report and not calling a custom report  the odd thing is that this is only local runs  reports out of jenkins are fine 
i'll be honest and say   i will try to create   if i get chance  i am unable to promise something  but meanwhile i can provide you information as much as you require 
upgrading to 3 0 352 resolved the issue for me  thanks  sabotageandi
while running the tests through specrun  code which requires appsetting json wont be executed as it try to find the json file in specflowplusrunner folder and it wont be available there if not placed explicitly  when it doesnt find the json file inside specrunner folder it gives an error which says cannot find appsetting json
hi  i am new to specflow  so can you please tell me where i can check this settings  i will mention it here  thank you in advance 
3 0 220  yes  i checked it on 3 0 225  and it works  thank you 
downgrading specrun runner and specrun specflow 3 0 0 to 3 0 352 does indeed resolve the problem 
hey  sabotageandi   the stack trace is coming from  the reason is when i pass featuregenerator as parameter is featuregeneratorprovider constructor  in this moment  featuregeneratorprovider has been already resolved in container  so it seems when i resolve featuregeneratorprovider  it will also resolve featuregeneratorprovider again  so in container  there are 2 featuregeneratorprovider   it will break featuregeneratorregistry
i use specflow version 3 1 67  the name of the test project is  companyname platform win32 test  the root namespace is compayname platform test  the generated type for assemblyfixture is companyname_platform_test_xunitassemblyfixture  which cannot be found 
 sabotageandi this is not consistent to reproduce  but still i will try to reproduce and update you 
thank you for the quick response to this ticket   net core sdk version for my project is 2 1 509  for compile project from command line    i haven't got set up my enviroment for this  i will try and answer tomorrow  btw  this error appear on 2 difference machine but in the same project 
hi thorsten  i use firefox 6  i am just guessing  what is the difference between the systems  could be the reason that i have translated the categories in 4 languages   jason  this is the new fully secure feature  you are not able to login  right  you could test the "registration" feature  
it is shown in the front end with the worng chars  and also if you edit it again  to correct it

yes  still the same problem  how long should it take  maybe the limits for max_execution_time or mysql connect_timeout are too short 
hey jason  which version of php do you use  module or cgi 
a trailing slash solved the problem  thx

hi  yes i see the file in the folder

 thorsten are you using this link for test  https   ibb co y4sq2ls
thank you for the quick reply  yes that sounds good  if it is unchecked  disallowed  by default  should also be available in the same way  when an admin user creates new users 
wouldn't you expect it to jump to the single location in the location list 
oh  so simple  didn't know about lclose and lopen  thanks
hidden is a boolean option 
close  but now i can't run manual  syntasticcheck  anymore 
i am using pyflakes and yes the work outside of syntastic on both the directories mentioned above  even i am trying to figure out what exactly might be the reason 
still trying to determine the actual reason  but it seems to only happen when i use the control s bindings with syntastic 
like i said  running a custom  govet  binary  anyway  i "fixed" it by wrapping it in a shell script which replaces the "vet" argument with      it works fine  thanks 
sorry for the late response  no i don't have eclim installed 
here is  a test file  http   hastebin com axazuhopew php   the problem still occurs after disabling other vim plugins that appeared in another profiling file i did before  it disappears when i disable syntastic 
that does  thank you 
not sure what the cuase is  but i know how to fix it after some twiddling  it happens only on  slim  files  when i comment out  vim slim  plugin or set passive mode for  slim  it does not happen anymore  for brevity  my versions    which now includes also  slim  
ah  yes  no more 'abnormal status' errors anymore and it shows the correct output in the quickfix dialogue  how can i correctly filter jshint then to only show the errors  the tail is doing something to the output 
i removed minibufexpl plugin and now everything works fine  thanks for help 
another one 
i'm using the last version    scss lint 0 48 0 
 lcd047 i got some error messages if the php coding include some syntax only be supported in php7 for example   the code  use ns   router  controller     will get error message  error   parse error  expecting  "identifier  t_string  "'  the code   x    list  0      true  will get error message  error   parse error  is there any way to fix error messages like these

 lcd047 syntastic
well i mentioned moving a split to a new tab  but really any movement of a buffer seems to unlink it from its location list   after checking  it seems that it's also the case with other similar objects  like vim fugitive's gblame linked splits   it seems annoying to me because lls appear anytime a buffer is opened moved saved  so it feels subpar that they are only weakly linked to their corresponding buffer  i guess i should find out how to disable enable syntastic with a hotkey to update the state of lls instead of expecting strong correlation of splits  but that seems imperfect as well 
 lcd047 i commented this out in  vimrc and it's working now  let g syntastic_ignore_files    ' m c ui_   '  ' m c config h '  ' m c global    '  they are c++ files 
nvm  it was because i had a session saved from before i installed the plugin  when i restored the session the plugin config was being unloaded  sorry i didn't know session saved that information  😅
thank you for your prompt reply  if i issue  let g syntastic_aggreate_errors   "on"   or "true" "yes"  the problem still persists  what did i do  i switched to the watson root directory and opened  watson watson py   i applied the following patch and saved  the patch is diff   git a watson watson py b watson watson py index e32abd7  1edff69 100644     a watson watson py +++ b watson watson py     1 5 +1 6    #     coding  utf 8     +import numpy import datetime from functools import reduce import json     7 10 +8 10    import operator import os import uuid  try    import configparser  except importerror    import configparser as configparser +# try  +import configparser +# except importerror  +# import configparser as configparser import arrow import click import requests what did i expect  i expected that syntastic would invoke  flake8  and report the superfluous import of numpy  what happened instead  no error is reported  the file looks error free from inside vim

hi  i tried the 'about gpu' thing in my chrome browser and nothing  just says it is trying to retrieve data  never gives an error  just the 'aw snap' window  i tracked it down to modernizr js    tests 'webgl'  through debugging statements  as for my version  chrome 10 0 608 0  68926  ubuntu 9 10 as i said  i get it from a google repository  so it isn't necessarily a 'stable' version 
to be honest i can't really think of a better way to do this  i'll experiment with data uri ing a 4px by 4px webp  then retrieving the width and height  i suspect that might work 
thanks  paul  i  made a jsfiddle page  http   jsfiddle net cme25     ajh us run in test  http   ajh us run in test   for it  results  ✓ correctly passes in webkit  opera  and ie8 ✓ correctly passs in firefox ✓ correctly shows failure in ie6 ❢ erroneously passes in ie8’s ie7 mode – untested in genuine ie7  does anyone have this lying around    so i made another jsfiddle page  http   ajh us run in 2  and changed the test to use  currentstyle  and  getcomputedstyle   and actually add the element to the document   this time  ✓ all browsers' results as expected 
well i know when following best practices in web application design  the application should look consistent across all major browsers  but sometimes you need to handle a very rare cases  for example  we were developing a website using liferay portal  and we didn't figure out that we need to support ie6 till the end of the project  and these browser type and version class name supported by liferay helped us a lot  modernizer is a great library and i thought it will be cool to have such feature 
the connect site for ie9 was closed after it rtm'd  i did however contact a pm on the ie9 team  i work on the asp net mvc team  and i will fill you in more when i hear back from him  for now modernizr could wrap those calls in a try catch because if anything errors out i would expect it to just say no it isn't supported 
i think having a css  prefix for all css feature detects is an easy and quite clearly delineated start  and could also be implemented without having to think about how to standardize names of other features   could also be split into css sel   selectors  and css prop   properties      though i don't see the point in doing that  as regards other features  it's certainly a lot less clear where the dividing line goes  if something is isn't in the html5 spec this is often not widely known  e g  i thought geolocation was html5 but have just checked and been proved wrong   so html5 probably isn't a good choice of prefix  equally html  js and dom as the line where one ends and the other begins is often blurry  so i suppose my best proposal is   css properties prefixed with css    introduce camel casing  mainly because js almost always uses camel casing and it's a bit odd to test for e g the existence of web  s  ocket by checking for modernizr web  s  ocket 
your welcome 
here is some sample html i can replicate the issue with  http   sharepaste com p bv8z83 the issue only occurs on native ie7 browsers and not with the developer toolbar in ie  i installed ie7 on a virtual pc to replicate it 
they were generated within an hour or so of each other  i am sure the minification process isn't meant to be random but it did produce 3 distinct results for me  with one of them not producing expected results when included in my site 
it should change to  svgclippathelement  test …  or  svgclippath  test …  instead of  svg  test …    that should cover chrome  firefox  opera  safari and mobilesafari as well  latest versions  but i can't ensure full cross browser platform compatibility 
any build step that takes more than 500ms  unless you expect it to be slow  like optimizing images   for modernizr  i expect it to just be a bunch of concats so it shouldn't be that slow 
will do 
that would be because your testcase is incorrect  the codepen sample does not include a vertical scrollbar  this issue _only_ occurs when a vertical scrollbar is present 
 patrickkettner oops  i referenced this issue in a pull request on a private repo  either github or waffle decided that this issue should close when my pull request was merged  reopening   
i generated something like this  http   modernizr com download # shiv cssclasses load at the bottom of an un minified file  right before yepnope is this   so when browserify wraps this up in a closure   this  is now that function  not the window 
it is  for me it says modernizr objectfit is not defined and object fit seems to work  strange will look into it again and post my feedback
it isn't working on ios this is the can i use http   caniuse com #feat document execcommand my interest came from here https   zenorocha github io clipboard js 
well  all i really want is a clean build of modernizr  and i can just check the built version into source    in fact  that's what we're doing now  the goal of the current exercise is to run the  npm  and  bower  invocations and end up with the  modernizr js  script in my  lib   directory  running  npm install modernizr  and  bower install modernizr  creates the modernizr directory with all the files i need  but then when i try to run the binary executable it complains about missing dependencies  i install them by hand with  npm install  and then i can run  bin modernizr  and everything's ok  i just thought that the nature of  npm     bower  would be to include the dependencies 
excuse me  patrickkettner  i was not clear  effectively  eweap  i speacking about this problem subject 
 patrickkettner hi patrick  i'm using  _modernizr 3 3 1_  custom build 
i've tried out iphone 7  ios 10 2   samsung galaxy tab 4  android 4 4 2   and a variety of other devices through browserstack and the ios simulator 
sorry  i meant false   
hi patrick  oh ok  i got it     i have an if condition where we were checking modernizr csstransitions to execute some statements  on the same condition  i would like to also check if ie version less than 11 or 9  project requirement   i thought we have some way to test this using modernizr and as i didn't found in docs i thought to check with your team  apologies for that     if we have some way to check using modernizr script just let me know  else please close this issue  thanks for your quick response 
 patrickkettner for sure   interestingly it looks to be pointing to the main node modules folder in the project itself  when the error points to a dependency within node modules nested in the modernizr dependency in my project    not sure if that is significant
if you haven't already  install ruby using the rubyinstaller http   rubyinstaller org downloads  then install the devkit using the instructions here  https   github com oneclick rubyinstaller wiki development kit thin relies on eventmachine  and will default to eventmachine 0 12 10  which will not compile on windows even with devkit installed   i don't know why   luckily  you can instead add  gem 'eventmachine'  '1 0 0 beta 3'  in your gemfile  which should install correctly and satisfy thin's dependency  using windows for ruby development introduces unique problems and sometimes you have to be willing to work with them or around them  padrino works just fine on windows  it's just that some extra steps are involved 
orm  datamapper  although it was the same with sequel  and mongoid  models  16 controllers  16 helpers  7
yes  bundler version 1 0 0 beta 3  in 1 8 7 p249 is the same bundler version
yeah  that works great  thanks 
sure  thanks 
si  it does 
ya it was solved  my fault   
thanks a lot  i'm trying to take a look  unfortunately on padrino head i have a different problem  not really a bug  but an implementation thing which makes it impossible to register first templateinheritance  rendering and then padrino  rendering     i'm just on irc asking for help  once this will be addressed  i'll check if this work  thanks for a very quick response 
 puts  produces some colorful output   p padrino  reloader exclude_constants  yields the following   the edge works  thank you 
sorry  please ignore the separate ar issue  it's not the main issue  sorry  my fault  the datamapper issue is real  though 
sure  is this what you're looking for  i pasted the whole thing  but the interesting part is most likely the 5 6 first lines 
why wouldn't work  highest priority routes would take precedence  that's the rack's point  stackable apps  if a route doesn't match try the next app  no  it seems to work if i do "use anotherapp" in my main app so maybe i just need to do that
yes  this fileld type supported by dm types  why i can t use it in migration 
wow  thanks so much  after switching the order of  ohm  and  ohm contrib   it works well  can you tell me how padrino generate the  gemfile   especially on the order of so many gems  thanks again 
i'm using activerecord  but mini_record looks awesome  i should try that 
is this rakefile  require 'bundler setup' require 'padrino core cli rake' padrinotasks use  database  padrinotasks use  activerecord  padrinotasks init
i'm using 0 11 x i don't understand what you mean by "mixing" post and put    i have that only route with no other verb associated  only put   and i'm using chrome advanced rest client to hit the url     i'll try now with postman   
it's probably not worth doing  seems a bit complicated  and you should pretty much always be able to replace relative links to rooted links in your own application   but if you're rendering  http   example com app bar baz   i'd expect  absolute_url 'foo'  to return  http   example com app bar foo   i e  take the current request url  and replace whatever is after the last slash in path with the argument  but  request url  also gives misleading result  so it's not that simple   
 namusyaka thanks for your answer  and i remove protect_from_csrf in app app rb  i see config apps rb and i want yo set set  protect_from_csrf  false but it's error  405 method not allowed   ok i see a solution in http   www randomactsofsentience com 2013 06 the dreaded attack prevented by html  so i set authenticity_token in angularjs post request  angularjs post request code 
that works 
sure thing  it's a class with a set of methods  it's inherited by other classes  the base class itself is never instantiated directly  it has the following methods 
 dariocravero middleware was my plan  i'd had thought about running it on   es6 js  as the extension and serve it to the browser as   js  or   es5 js   my logic on that is that while we could run it on all   js  files  there is no value in wasting resources on transpiling something to itself  you could though run   js       js  though you could do   es6  and convert on the fly to   js  for transpiling and serving  would depend on how padrino wanted to address the issue of es6  my thought is there are two real options      js  to   js  — simplest option for users and least likely to confuse people     es6 js  to   js       es6  to   js  — makes sure that the developer understands what they are writing and relies on them to make the correct name  with that said  this should come with performance benefits as you can avoid all files without the extension and not have to do any analysis  my guess is we will need to use something like browserify for module though i haven't looked at any of the es6 shims enough to be able to say if there is a shim which would be lighterweight  what are your thoughts 
yes  it is now as expected  thank you 
mostly using capybara webkit  but this happens when using selenium too  it usually happens when an element can't be found on the page  there is no stack trace other than my failing steps  my steps simply have things like  fill_in  fields or  click_on  links or  expect page  to have_content   the cause of the failure is that the ajax request hasn't finished  and capybara doesn't know to wait for those requests to finish  normally  capybara is smart enough to wait  but in this case  it's some sort of conflict with ember js's virtual dom 
the selenium driver  is it a selenium problem then  i am still not sure about the internals of capybara     it simply works     and that's great    
i was already using 1 1 0  tried to update to 1 1 1 but still get the same error  i also just noticed that i get no error when running the spec through selenium 
yes  here it is 
i'm using  capybara 1 0 1  default   js    true  driver  aka  capybara  selenium  driver     mongrel 1 2 0 pre2  as dev server and  rack 1 2 4  as test server  i don't think i can change this as it's part of  capybara  server     ruby 1 9 2  and  rails 3 0 10   when acceptance specs fail are due they fail dom assertions then i know there's an app problem  if i look at the firefox zombie executing the specs i can see the exception messages are being returned as response bodies but not the backtrace  obviosly capybara is completly unaware that there was an app exception rather than an failed dom assertion and the rspec output is completly uninformative about the real problem 
when you are developing it is useful to see the state under certain conditions  arises in rapidly debugging 'raw' use cases  i e  not yet fully baked  most useful when retro specifying describing legacy web appd pages that you have just landed on  your next spec often isin a similar context to  but is independent of  the last feature  you need the browser up so you can experience what your are abbout to try and write a feature for    convincing 
ya  of course  this seems like a bug to me though 
sure  sorry for not mentioning we use selenium earlier  reproducer 
i don't want to use any locale dependencies in my cucumber tests  i follow links by url and fill forms by input names   and the only input type i cannot fill this way by default is a checkbox with multiple values 
osx 10 9 mri 2 0 0p247 capybara 2 1 0
the call i'm making is 
so in my specific use case i am refactoring a bunch of specs  that i did not write  to use headless chrome instead of poltergeist  one of them is testing that the pop up comes up before reloading  if this is an automatic browser feature  then i guess you could argue that there's no need to test the browser behavior  since that should be tested already  then again  a failing spec here could be really useful should chrome ever remove this feature  or change how it is triggered   and i'm not sure i'd assume this is terrible ux  we are dealing with forms  filled out by internal users  that could have a lot of data and are very sensitive to our business  if someone accidentally refreshed  perhaps forgetting which tab they are in   they could lose a lot of time reentering all that data  not so horrendous in that case  edit  i'd suggest just making this behavior optional  default it to what it does now  but allow people to turn it off in case they need to  since it'd have to be a conscious decision  there would be room to explain in the docs why this might not be the most prudent way to go 
d'oh  figures it's one of the 7 prs already open    p yeah  i just need to be able to ignore the querystring  i have a multi subdomain site so i want to check i'm at the subdomain corresponding to my single sign on portal  but the query will never match because it contains encrypted hashed session info 
the missing  '  was indeed a typo when i typed it in here  the first click injects the element with class   some_class2  into the dom  here is the full rspec failure with stacktrace 
here are the versions of our drivers 
it's in w3c mode  the current version is chromedriver 75 0 3770 140  2d9f97485c7b07dc18a74666574f19176731995c refs branch heads 3770  #1155   running on macos 10 14 5 we are setting it up with the following options   we are seeing this issue on each of our team member's local machines as well as our travisci builds  are there any more details i can provide 
sorry i was confusing there  no we're on ruby 2 6 5 i just share your suspicion that this kind of thing will change in 2 7 but i haven't thought through whether it would fix this case or make it worse  we're on the latest money 6 13 4  we upgraded a bunch of things in upgrading to rails 6 so i'm not certain which thing changed  yeah  i don't think this is a bug exactly  more a quirk 😄
this is the offending config option 
 gerasiov would they be opened to use github api and automatically create issues whenever a _nightly_ build start failing  if they even have such a thing   also  what would be a proper way of testing  isn't it kinda hard to debug on powerpc64 without having any kind of local setup 
there is an _essential_ piece of information i omitted from my initial bug report  in my use case  the input and output file are the same  it's actually a backup file that i create on my own before calling uncrustify  and therefore  in good faith  uncrustify creates backup files  this definitely should remain the default behavior but when the user explicitly asks for no backups  uncrustify should respect that 
i mean i want to format the file that contains these lines  and i want everything formatted except for these lines  they should stay as they are 
sorry  you are right     before 
i love this project and i'd like to contribute in some way  but at the moment my understanding of the source code is very  very  limited    my fixes work on my code  but i fear they could be "wrong" in general     d anyway  i used the same strategy found in the ct_case 
honestly  i've never done a pr with github  and i'm not sure how it's done   a branch  a fork   making things worse  i don't have cmake installed and configured on my  windows  machine  so i really can't even test my change  rookie problems  i know  but the change is simply commenting out line 38 in src compat_win32 cpp

i do not  and removing that line fixed the problem  i had not noticed that setting was enabled  thanks a billion 
i just started using uncrustify this week  so i have only ever tried this one version  but since issue #411 is closed  i assume there must be some working version from around that time 
yes  this was fixed a while back by the commit that added that  thanks 
i'll try again on tuesday  and with the current git to check if the issue is still there  i'll keep you posted  thanks

i think it's a good idea to lead with the simple "if you are already have python and pip installed and configured  just run 'pip install   user nltk'" instructions  as if that works  the user can just run it and move on  if you _assume_ it's necessary to instruct them on how to install python  there's a risk they're going to put nltk in the "too hard" basket  and miss the fact that it was only a single command away  it's then worth asking "how may those simple instructions fail "  the three main cases  1  they don't have python at all yet  in those cases  i suggest deferring to the scipy stack instructions  since that will get the affected users a numpy accelerated nltk  http   scipy org install html 2  they have python  but not pip  in those cases  i suggest deferring to pip's own bootstrapping instructions  https   pip pypa io en latest installing html 3  they have python and pip  but there's something else that prevents the "pip install   user nltk" approach working  e g  they're using a system python 3 installation on linux  where "pip" installs into the python 2 stack  and you need to use "pip3" or "python3  m pip" to install into the right version   for this case  i suggest recommending they try "python  m pip install   user nltk"  and if that still doesn't work  then point them at https   docs python org 3 installing  for further ideas to try  finally  for more advanced usage  like learning how to use virtual environments   you could point them to https   packaging python org en latest  and https   packaging python org en latest science html the key is to focus on "how can i get a user to the point of productively using nltk in the smallest number of possible steps "  rather than trying to teach them extraneous skills  like using virtual environments  which are likely to be helpful to them in the long run  but are initially just a distraction from the task of getting up and running for the first time   "this will be helpful to you later  trust me" almost never engages an in person student's attention  and it's even less effective when used as part of a self directed learning process 
hi  ok  i guess it was somewhat unclear to me what tag_sents   is supposed to do  then  since i had developed my script with 3 0 0  originally  i was under the impression that segmentation tokenization was always going to be done by the stanford code  but tag_sents   was simply the variant suited for tagging multiple sentences  actually  i found that behavior to be fairly useful  if it is not the intended default behavior  i would certainly suggest to make it available  as optional behavior   same for postagger  actually   note that using the stanford tokenizer also provided robustness against certain types of easy to run into problems  even for the single sentence case  for instance  the stanford ner tagger expects punctuation to be provided as separate tokens  if input is pre tokenized   which is typically not quite as easy to achieve as splitting raw input on whitespace  as one example of many  the code provided in issue #761 is incorrect in this case  in providing tokens such as "abend " containing punctuation  having the stanford tagger deal with all such subtleties  appropriately and automatically  is definitely comfortable  so  summary  this is not the same request as #761   rather i would like to  optionally  get back the behavior that i can safely pass non tokenized  or mis tokenized  text to the ner tagger  regards thomas

well really it would be more like     the point isn't that it's difficult to implement but rather that it feels incomplete to have a function which inserts into an array in order but no function to query for a location of an object in said array while taking advantage of its sortedness  as far as i can think of  there's only two uses for sortedindex  keeping a sorted list for display purposes  simple iteration   and for maintaining an efficient datastructure  my request is for the latter scenario  if there's no interest in supporting that  then i'll maintain my own helpers    
this would randomly shuffle the elements of an array  as if they were a deck of cards someone shuffled with their hands  essentially  it is the opposite of a sorting algorithm  dealing cards exemplifies a good use case for this  you shuffle the array  then pop elements off of it  you can see a good  evenly distributed shuffle algorithm implemented in javascript here  http   en wikipedia org wiki fisher e2 80 93yates_shuffle#example_implementations
thanks  it's really nice to have this in 
yep  that would work   thanks though i think there's still a case for creating an alias for it  similar to how _ compact is an alias for a very simple filter function  e g 
well  this fn is designed to provide the most used and most important thing  cloning of super prototype and assigning it to the prototype of the current constructor  this is the most natural and fast way for javascript  there is no real static thingy in js  if user want to copy super constructor properties  they can do this using your  extend mehtod  the  super thingy is also atypical for javascript and every lowlevel framework do this using direct method access over prototype   parent prototype method  the goal of  inherits is not to provide all the classical oop features  but to make typical prototype assignment more convenient  you and underscore js users shouldn't see  inherits like "the way to go" for doing oop via underscore  its just a tiny utility and it is really handy  low level and very javascript like  what do you think 
this previously generated a newline   so i used the former in a ton of places 
yeah  good point  i guess i was thinking about edge cases  but we shouldn't clutter up the api  thanks 
that's a solution 
i faced with the need of such function and actually added a mixin while was validating a complex config object  but i agree with you it is quite ad hoc function 
that's what i'm currently doing but i would like to group similar methods together under one namespace

 akre54 #221 is about remove single key  my suggestion is about alternative to existing function   _ omit   with same interface  for using  _ omit  when you need a new object as result or using '_ remove' when you just want to remove some keys from object 
thanks for the replies  i'll use stackoverflow from now on  i'll take a look at scope  one of the motivations of the question was a blurry memory of a discussion of the weirdness of scope in inline event handlers  but it looks like that is not what's going on  on wed  apr 16  2014 at 8 48 pm  adam krebs notifications github comwrote  ## generate messages about directories that cannot be read  files that cannot be opened     rather than being silent      from  man du  
well a date object is not an empty object    so it should return false   but i guess you're right the description says "enumerable object" like arrays and hashes so it could be the expected behavior

i can easily build around it   it's a property describing the elements in the array  so to my mind it was more elegant to keep it as a property of the array   i expect there would be a performance hit to changing the behavior  so it's fine as it is  consider adding an additional note at the start of the documentation on array functions that copies of arrays will not include properties set on them

looks like it does  i've created a test program in python which does       and so on 
i'm using zmq for events multicasting on the html5 sse connections  for my opinion  minimal group length must be about 24 bytes  e g  for storing uuid with small prefix  increasing valid length is a technical problem 
i am seeing the opposite effect  here is my entire test program   i've attached a screenshot of the packet capture from letting this program run for about 30 seconds  filtered by port 59999     rawcap  https   user images githubusercontent com 40001020 41130977 cad84ce2 6a7e 11e8 9225 ce40e707b009 png 
there is an interesting discussion in the comments there which shows some nuance not shown by the post itself  in our case  we're running on an embedded system where we didn't implement exceptions  but we've been using zmq successfully  our allocator can do some recovery  some data structures can be made non critical  costing one extra indirection   if recovery fails  we reboot the system 
to reproduce this situation is not easy  it has something to do with data  and even the frequency of cpu  this is just a undefined behavior that happens now and then  we did some testing for pgm_receiver_t  in_event   function  and we found that in_event could be called even if there is a pending restart_input call  this is the problem that caused the crash  because inpos could become nullptr in in_event function call  in this situation  the system would crash  if we are lucky that inpos does not become null  its value could be changed  restart_input wont get the intended result  the reason for this conflict is that though in_event stops polling  it does not stops triggering  some events are already polled  and about to trigger in_event  our proposed fix for this problem is the following  1  add a check for active_tsi at the beginning of in_event  if this pointer is not null  there is a pending restart_input call  we just return to make sure restart_input run first and restart_input calls in_event after processing the pending data  2  add insize   0 at the beginning of each cycle  3  move "inpos    unsigned char  tmp " down to "insize   static_cast size_t  received   to make code cleaner  this function now looks like this  the output part at the very beginning is just for our testing purpose  and that message is printed occasionally  certainly our change need reviews from the experts in zmq                                                                                                                         void zmq  pgm_receiver_t  in_event      if  active_tsi    null    std  cerr    __file__    "  "    __line__    " in_event called with active_tsi not null "    std  endl  return       read data from the underlying pgm_socket  const pgm_tsi_t  tsi   null  if  has_rx_timer    cancel_timer  rx_timer_id   has_rx_timer   false       todo  this loop can effectively block other engines in the same i o    thread in the case of high load  while  true       get new batch of data     note the workaround made not to break strict aliasing rules  insize   0  void  tmp   null  ssize_t received   pgm_socket receive   tmp   tsi      no data to process  this may happen if the packet received is    neither odata nor odata  if  received    0    if  errno    enomem    errno    ebusy    const long timeout   pgm_socket get_rx_timeout     add_timer  timeout  rx_timer_id   has_rx_timer   true    break       find the peer based on its tsi  peers_t  iterator it   peers find   tsi      data loss  delete decoder and mark the peer as disjoint  if  received     1    if  it    peers end       it  second joined   false  if  it  second decoder    null    libzmq_delete it  second decoder       break       new peer  add it to the list of know but unjoint peers  if  it    peers end       peer_info_t peer_info    false  null   it   peers zmq_map_insert_or_emplace   tsi  peer_info  first    insize   static_cast  size_t   received   inpos    unsigned char   tmp     read the offset of the fist message in the current packet  zmq_assert  insize    sizeof  uint16_t    uint16_t offset   get_uint16  inpos   inpos +  sizeof  uint16_t   insize    sizeof  uint16_t      join the stream if needed  if   it  second joined       there is no beginning of the message in current packet     ignore the data  if  offset    0xffff  continue  zmq_assert  offset    insize   zmq_assert  it  second decoder    null      we have to move data to the beginning of the first message  inpos +  offset  insize    offset     mark the stream as joined  it  second joined   true     create and connect decoder for the peer  it  second decoder   new  std  nothrow  v1_decoder_t  0  options maxmsgsize   alloc_assert  it  second decoder     int rc   process_input  it  second decoder   if  rc     1    if  errno    eagain    active_tsi   tsi     stop polling  reset_pollin  pipe_handle   reset_pollin  socket_handle   break    it  second joined   false  libzmq_delete it  second decoder   insize   0         flush any messages decoder may have produced  session  flush

i'm confused by your comment  zmq_event_monitor_stopped is expected and zmq_event_handshake_succeeded is actual  why would the documentation be wrong  if you were to comment out bounce function  tested on rust zmq since this is where i encountered this issue at first  then 0x0400 is sent properly and not 0x1000  i believe there is a bug in the library that is encountered by running the documented code  maybe the title is unclear 
 bluca not likely  i'm not doing anything particular when it happens  it works fine 99 99  of times  it looks like race conditions 
sorry  could you let me know how to do that  i only heard of the pr procedure but have never been through one myself 
imho the most significant difference is that you have std  tr1    available  completeness may depend on compiler   among others you get tr1  shared_ptr  tr1  random  tr1  regex and some others  see for example https   gcc gnu org onlinedocs libstdc++ manual using_headers html

i originally just had it in a "spec support authenticated_controller rb" file without any of the additional module wrappings and it does the same there  i saw a post  http   pastie org 870928  which suggested wrapping it and also trying  shared    true which is what i've got there but that doesn't seem to make a difference which way i do it 
sorry for the late answer  the zentest version is 4 4 2
yes  this pass   so  should i replace all my following tests with that syntax 
same output for  rake  t   grep spec  as before  i also deleted gemfile lock and re ran  bundle install   not sure if that matters or not   here's my updated gemfile 
that was the problem  i had rspec in my test group but not development group  dumb mistake  sorry for the noise  p s  using  rails 3 1 0  and it's a brand new project  i _could_ run the  rspec  install  generator with  rspec  only being in the test group  i think  bundle exec  loads all groups by default  hmm  wait    by that logic   bundle exec rake  t  should have shown the tasks 
i'm not sure if an example spec   code will provide any more insight  debugger when running specs   rails has changed the keys to symbols  but rspec is still using the old string keys 
thanks  it appears that this is related to rbenv + zsh combination  command line arguments are not being passed in using the rake shim 
yes  exact same error 
at the moment nothing  i am still trying to understand when this happens cause does not looks like the wrapper is always applied  am i correct 
some more testing give shows me that inside any test i find correctly setted the default_locale as it is on application rb but the i18n locale is always  en only exception is when i use spork 
it works  now  i have had this in my spec_helper rb for a good long while    and i deal with response bodies in other tests  and they seem to be fine    any ideas

i did a global update of my gems on my system and updated the gemfile lock with "bundle update"  it is using rspec rails 2 12 2 and rspec 2 12 2 below is an excerpt of my gemfile lock  i find it weird that rspec mocks is not 2 12 2 but 2 12 1 but well   
i googled the term "how to test generators with rspec" and found two gems for it   generator_spec  https   github com stevehodgkiss generator_spec  and  genspec  http   github com sinisterchipmunk genspec   i spent the whole day to make them work and i couldn't  after your comment  i jumped into your specs and found out you're using  ammeter  https   github com alexrothenberg ammeter   and now it's working perfectly with my app  i don't know why this gem wasn't in my google search results  but why not adding this feature to rspec rails by default 
i can't seem to access the issues list for https   github com newrelic rpm and hasn't heard back from newrelic support on my support ticket yet  does anyone knows how to get this across to them on github  the easy workaround works great for now 
i'm using 2 13 1  i was reluctant to upgrade because 2 14 broke my specs  i guess i don't have a choice  i'll reopen if i still have this issue with 2 14 thank you
here are the old versions that worked

yes  but of different types  t1 and t2 
seeking the underlying stream is ok for when we start reading  the difficulty i was having was determining the point in the stream that we're up to when we've finished processing the batch  the reason is because the streamreader does its own buffering and the csvparser also does some buffering  so i started by reflecting the buffer position in the csvparser class and doing some math with the reader underlyingstream position but that wasn't always accurate for me  next i started reflecting the charactersread field after each readline   method and keeping a tally  but as you can see  its not the most elegant solution   
sorry for the overly delayed response  we are already using meta data classes  i knew about the other way but thought being able to use meta data classes would help keep all our model logic in one place  thanks
this is my poco class   and this is the csv produced by the following distributor  getfakedistributor 1  "under lock   key inc "  "info lockandkey com"  "123 burbon st "  "alabama"  "usa"  "1111"  ""  "http   lockandkey com"  1 1234567  44 23568793  "distributor name" "type" "service product type" "category" "address" "zip code" "city" "country" "phone" "web" "email" "latitude longitude" "under lock   key inc " "faked type" " none " "faked category" "123 burbon st " "1111" "alabama" "usa" "" "http   lockandkey com" "info lockandkey com" "1 123457 44 235688" the " none " value is produced by the null offerings property on the object 
i didn't see it there  i ended up using reflection to transform each field one by one so that i could determine which field was causing the problem 
no i didn't  i have database records that sometimes have null  or 1 1 1900  or a "real" date  i was going to use convertusing   to change the nulls all to 1 1 1900 and do the same when reading the existing database records  what i ended up doing was just importing the data "as is" and then i just added the extra logic in my object comparison function  which was probably a better way to do it anyway  on fri  oct 25  2013 at 10 44 am  josh close notifications github comwrote 
yes thats exactly what i want  i'm mapping a file to a class that contains some different properties  but to make it easier for the customer so they dont get it wrong  some fields are required but i want optional fields to be optional in the sense that they dont have to be in the file  also i want to use header names to map instead of indexes  so the order of the columns doesn't matter  last part should be entirely possible as far as i know  i probably need to do some reflection to get the name of the column and map it to the correct field on the class though  i'll try  willthrowonmissingfield   false   its important that it still throws an exception if the field is one of the required fields though 
great   we must be doing something wrong then  i'll investigate further tomorrow and will be sure to report back

hi josh unfortunately i don't have control over them as it is sourced from a different system  is there something u can do for this to be fixed  
unfortunately not as it also trims quoted fields  what i need is equivalent to  https   github com phatcher csvreader blob master code lumenworks framework io csv valuetrimmingoptions cs#l19 they perform the trim early in the parser so it would solve #422 as well   https   github com phatcher csvreader blob master code lumenworks framework io csv csvreader cs#l1222 
hi  if the limit is exceeded i would like to either throw it as a reading exception or treat it in the reading callback  thank you 
yes  it still fails    it says outofmemory  but only 60  of memory is used    so it can't be the issue  maybe a bug which appears in combination of uwp and csvhelper 
the correct thing was the need to flush it  the "position" suggestion had nothing to do with it  as the stream was empty  still i think that since i'm passing the stream to the csvwriter  through the streamwriter  it should be csvwriter job to ensure data is flushed  just my thought  thanks 
i mean something like  type   detectcolumntypes string csvfilepath  string delimiter  int maxnumberofrows  this method will return us the type of each column in the given csv file 
possibly  how do i pass the information into the constructor  could you give me an example 
all f# records  unless annotated with climutable  are immutable  as far as i can tell  looking back through old json net release notes  they've supported creating objects via constructor parameters  and hence supporting immutable objects  for a long time  potentially introducing in  3 5 5  https   github com jamesnk newtonsoft json releases tag 3 5 5   more recently there's been some explicit f# support for discriminated unions and so forth  but i suspect f# records primarily 'just work' because of the constructor parameters support 
_ hey  my code block doesn't have all the nice color formatting _  with references    any user of person  such as position  just needs one line in the classmap for person  without references    all users of person must map all properties of all contained classes  i understand that when there are colliding header names or you want to map by index  you have no choice but to map each sub property all the way down  but when column names are unique and you can rely on  name   it is very nice for each class to have mappings in their own classmap

 joshclose i'm having a really difficult time creating a repro    this is a true heisenbug  the model that i'm trying to write has a single ctor that accepts a single object  this "object" has property that links to another object    which links to another object  etc  just your standard entity framework models  nothing really special  no crazy reflection etc  every time i attempt to narrow down the chain  and eliminate every property that is causing the infinite loop  i just inevitably end up at the  start  of the chain again  i realize this is probably an awful explanation  and i'm sorry for that  anyway  if you have any suggestions for how to narrow this down or if i should attempt to log certain lines in csvhelper  let me know 
i mean both  i think a library should not use an other lib which is already included in the  net framework     4 7   with the csv helper we do not get any crashs or something  but i think it is not a very clean way    however    i only open an issue here because i thought it is maybe a solution for removing the useless extra valuetuple package  it was the same with the automapper package  the guys resolved it  some users had problems with the automapper in 4 7  caused of the valuetuple package   
here is my header row ownerfirstname   ownerlastname   propaddress   propcity   propstate   propzip   mailingaddress   mailingcity   mailingstate   mailingzip   property county   cumulativedue the issue with datatable is that it returns null although i am able to get ercord using getrecords   
i'm getting this error with csvhelper 15 and 14  netstandard2 0   i tried it on different machine that uses 4 7  getting same error  those are versions that has tasks extensions as dependency  v13 doesn't have direct dependency on tasks extensions  but bcl requires it too  maybe this is because bcl and csvhelper refer to different version of task extension  i haven't tested it on actual net framework app  only on core   so this also could be some powershell specific thing 
after implementing the configuration class and pass it in the constructor it finished 15  faster  and that makes sense because it doesn't need to instantiate the configurationclass each time 3000 times in my case  thats because i really like to have a single instance of the csvreader to speed it up even more    before   
good ideas  i would find this useful

win 7 pro x64  seems the selected item is in the clipboard after selecting and ctrl v will paste  i was expecting it to 'quickpaste' on double click as it does from the main app window  also  i think to make this really useful you should be able to select the tab from the tray pop up on the fly

i am on 2 4 9  this has been a very weird bug for me  i am not if it's kde related or copyq related  i am unable to reproduce it in i3  i am closing it for now until i can reproduce it with much greater confidence 
no  i have a script which is often manually executed that will upload current clipboard content  it need to know the content type to do the right choice of uploading 
well  the problem is  the old first item gets pasted into vbox  i think it's due to the delay of clipboard sharing

okay  here's a concrete example  though it happens with any regex or command body  create a new command  of type "in menu"  for content matching write   http   and for the command body write  copyq popup  1   so if you copy to clipboard  using ctrl c  text that starts with http  you will see the command in the copyq menu  if the text doesn't start with http  the command won't show up   but  if you use unix style mouse selection  without ctrl c  to select text starting with http  and have "store text selected using mouse" checked   you will see the selected item show up in copyq's list of items properly  yet the command won't appear in the menu    conversely  if the last thing you ctrl c'd to the clipboard starts with http  and now you use unix style mouse selection to select that doesn't start with http  the command will remain in the copyq menu because it is still comparing the regex to the last item in the ctrl c clipboard and ignoring the newer item that came in through the mouse selection  hope that makes sense  i believe it should be easily reproducible  just wondering if this is expected behavior  p s  are you saying "global shortcut" can't be used with unix style selected items  or are you referring to something else when you say "item selection"  thanks

good morning  my apologies i was out of the office over the weekend  i have quite a few commands  attached zip format  w10e64   app v3 1 2  backup zip  https   github com hluk copyq files 1737720 backup zip 
my apologies  i only have access to the computer during weekdays  using chrome beta  and hangouts chat  in browser  due to suite edu edition   i have to run today  but will try tomorrow on the disabling  and provide update 
hi  here is the output  copyq clipboard manager v3 7 2 qt  5 12 0 compiler  gcc arch  x86_64 little_endian lp64 os  macos 10 14 maybe info plist is not correctly generated 
i'm forgot at all about the copyq plugin itemweb  now i update it  and all work good  thank you very much for your time and your support 
hi lukas  thank you for a quick response  i sure did read the guide  on the desktop  there are no errors in the log when i press f12  i believe this is due to the fact that the encryption command is disabled  i e  there is no button to click to encrypt because the encryption engine is not accessible  this is copyq version 3 4 0  which i installed today  the laptop has an older version 3 3 1  which allows you to click the encrypt button despite the fact that there is no encryption engine connected and i get this  hope this can help boris
# copyq   version copyq clipboard manager v3 5 0  hluk email cz  built with  qt 5 3 2 installed it from here   https   github com hluk copyq releases  https   github com hluk copyq releases  but happened since at least 3 1 2  i didn't test previous versions  
yes thank you it's good enough  yet  is it possible to create a command for "show main window    press ctrl+a    press del    hide main window"  
it seems github automatically assigned the  bug  tag when i created the issue  as copyq doesn't implement this yet  it's indeed more a feature request than a documentation bug  i'll leave you to decide if this is out of scope for the software or not  thanks anyway   
i would like to save an item in the clipboard pernament under a tab  i create a new tab  copy an item in word  after this the item is in clipboard  i drag the item to the tab that i would like to save for the future  next day i start the computer  i want to use the item again under the tab i created  i click on copy to clipboard  paste it in word and see the text and a square with a red cross  where an image should be  it contains the message "the image cannot be displayed " hope this helps  thanks 
thank you 
yes  in step 1  the format is  text plain   and the content is  testofcopyq   in step 2  the format is  text plain   and the content is  file    x  testingforhluk testofcopyq txt   in step 3  i'm accidentally trying to paste the item from step 2 into a text field  i don't know how  but my file manager recognizes that  file    x  testingforhluk testofcopyq txt  is a file  and doesn't even let the text to be pasted  which is good   what makes that really interesting is that if i simply copy the literal string  file    x  testingforhluk testofcopyq txt  into the clipboard  it does allow pasting that text  but that reveals a different copyq issue  see #1353  either way  what i really want to paste is  testofcopyq  
i don't remember exactly  reinstalled according to the instructions on github  will reopen if it's slow again

 hut it appears that is what is happening  thanks 
yeah i did  when i hover on a video file ranger starts loading and a mediainfo preview is generate on the right side
you're right  it was the config  thanks for the quick response 
i had set it to st 256color  i am using st  the terminal from suckless and i had set term to st 256color in  tmux conf if i start tmux without the term above  it starts up with a term screen and that breaks some apps looking for 256 colors  on tue  feb 19  2013 at 3 01 pm  hut notifications github com wrote

it contains a single line  "document djvu djvu" 
of course you can  it works for me but it might contain some errors 
 vifon   it doesn't work  i already tried that as you can see it in my opening comment

hi  i was running iterm2 on mac  and ranger via ssh  thanks   yong on sun  apr 16  2017 at 1 27 pm  wojciech siewierski   notifications github com  wrote 
i highly doubt it  since #1532 sandboxes the preview script   scope sh    not the image previewer which is then set with  pager set_image  once the file type has been determined  however   bwrap   by default   does launch the process in   home   https   jlk fjfi cvut cz arch manpages man bwrap 1#environment   regardless  i believe this should be the default and not hidden behind an option  so i might wrap this up in a quick pr  no promises  though 
i deleted  scope sh   but that didn't change anything  i then did  ranger   copy config scope   but that didn't fix the issue either  i continue to experience the same crash and traceback whenever my selection goes over to  default rdp  
 octave workspace  was the first file element in this directory and i wasn't able to see the content of the directory  i'm sorry  i can't reproduce it anymore  if it will reappear  i'll try to find out how to reproduce it 
setting    clean  changed nothing  i've tried different terminals  fresh clone  switching to python 2 7  ranger on arm  but i always get the same result as shown above  although python 2 produces shorter traceback  
yes    i can confirm that bash works normally this way  might be a zsh issue 
i can call  w3m  path to image jpg   but  w3mimgdisplay  path to image jpg  does nothing   echo     returns a 1  edit  after a little research i learned that w3mimgdisplay can't be called that way  https   www mail archive com mutt users mutt org msg34445 html has the details  so following that format  and correcting a typo   i can verify that  yes  w3mimgdisplay will display a png image  for an instant as the terminal redraws over the image when it scrolls   but will not display a jpg from the command line  i guess this makes it a w3m issue  and not a ranger issue  p
 vifon thanks  your patch works perfectly  maybe more is for personal preferences  i'm using emacs enabling the line number relative  and it gives option for users to choose how to display current line  just like below   so i feel not get used to the absolute one   d
you should be     i'm not familiar with this code at all  i have not  i guess the first question is whether the idea of selecting a dir after creating it is indeed desired  if there is agreement on this and we would like that to be part of the  mkdir  command  i would be happy to do more stress testing and try to consider all kinds of situations  and improve the patch  by the way  thanks to both of you for taking a look at this issue 
i tried  set hint_collapse_threshold 1  but the behaviour didn't change  is that a bug  i find it distracting  i know the bindings by now  
 vifon i solved the problem by editing my  zshrc file in the way i describe above  i found the solution  here  https   superuser com questions 1043806 how to exit the ranger file explorer back to command prompt but keep the current    why can't ranger  as its last command  send the shell command "cd  url user closed ranger in"  maybe there are some other ways to achieve this functionality  unfortunately i am incompetent in linux programming     
hey toonn  thanks for chiming in  hadn't heard of that feature  interesting  anyways  tried   ctrl q   didn't do anything 
i apologise for not testing when i opened the issue  it was really late for me   after uninstalling pillow from both pip and my package manager and reinstalling it again i could import  image  and ranger displayed images normally 
 jadowityherbatnik the output of  xprop  is pasted below  ignoring the icons 
ueberzug is on the path  at least it can be invoked on the shell  i think indeed it might be a path problem is there some environmental variable i can define  i installed ueberzug with pip  but most of python packages and x11 libraries using opensuse repository  there is no official opensuse package for ueberzug  le ven  10 janv  2020 à 20 32  toon nolten  notifications github com  a écrit  
sorry for the late reply  yes  actually  i saw the same problem as in #1815 with  identify  eating up all the ram  however  my image is in  png  format  and i realized that it actually isn't as big as i first said  maybe i looked at the wrong file   as it's about 33 mbs 
oops i don't how the issue been sent twice  sorry about that  i don't see any getter for the acl on the file object  can you give me a link or file+line on this mock implementation  what i meant is that i don't want to write something like   directory files should_receive 'create'  with  key  path  body      multipart_chunk_size      acl  true  content_type        i hope that explanation makes a bit more sense    thanks
thanks for the fix  i'll open a new ticket 
 geemus i'd say take care of it in fog  if people are handling it with a gsub it shouldn't matter anyway   i'll work on a change 
 geemus my mistake  the file watcher was not running  i do see the threading in the  tests   method  https   github com fog fog blob master rakefile#l65   editing issue 
1 5 0
i made a few changes and pushed them to my fog fork  https   github com tbak fog commit 2073e89c67e4d2b6f8871ebb896540ad1ff2ea8b the namespace problem i fixed just by ignoring them  class fog  parsers  base   not elegant solution  but if non of the plugins use namespaces this should do the trick  i tested this only with aws and eucalyptus  there are a few other problems with eucalyptus ws endpoint  it does not follow strictly the api  i tweaked describeinstances class  so in the end i got things working  server create list delete  
 geemus i'm just coming up to speed on vcloud  i think it could be an acceptable limitation but should be documented  if there is more than one vm  it is hard to tell which vapp template to get  they might always be the same  i don't know enough to say 
in terms filehandling  we did not change anything    the last change beeing the  awesome  move to fog 3 month ago  i know it might be hard to spot such errors  and i also put it here to see if others have similar issues  so dont hang this too high  we have lots of small  50 100kb pdf files  in case of those empty downloaded files  i changed the handling from
backtrace 
 geemus hi  did i do it good   avi 
 +1  if you can help me get started  would love to submit a pr related to this
yep  i would expect it to spin on 404s  but re raise other errors like 403s or 401s  not that a 401 really makes sense in this context  but it should be non transient   500s are a bit harder to judge since it might not be obvious if it is a transient error or not 
probably   this gives me an excuse to submit  this patch  https   build opensuse org package view_file home aspiers branches devel languages ruby extensions rubygem vagrant libvirt gemspec ruby libvirt 0 5 patch expand 1  to  the official opensuse build  https   build opensuse org package show devel languages ruby extensions rubygem vagrant libvirt  or at least get a few people to try my version with the  ruby libvirt  dependency changed to 0 5     thanks  and watch this space

it seems that the cgi escape is trying to follow the rfc3986  which is not completely bad thing  although the success is varying 
that would be cool  yes  i did it now in a clumsy way  just asking if the file is public by doing this   as i needed to only modify public files this was sufficient  when setting file cache_control i then also set  file acl   'public read'   having  file acl  is definitely helpful  and intuitive 
i didn't exactly understand your suggestion  the opennebula api provides you facts variables in template which can be overridden  afterwards you are able to deploy vm's with your created template  i'm not sure but i guess in one of the modified fog version of netways  https   github com netways fog  this was already working  thanks in advance 
i was a bit afraid you would say that  as adding a boolean is much simpler than a hash  but i agree  it's probably better to model the different options supported by libvirt  even if fog has no support for them at first  i'll see what i can do  thank you 
the code is the exact same for version 1 35  all we do is replace the version in the first line  we are currently using compute because we are making these calls from outside our openstack environment and the identity class attempts to use the internal ips of the services 
o  here you go  thanks

i'm running a standard solarized theme  it happens in both iterm and terminal under snow leopard  in april  this was reported as a bug to solarized itself  but fixing it there would require changing the colors  which the author isn't willing to consider  here's the solarized issue  altercation solarized#66 
just to clarify  pending will be treated as is   as  cgriego said  it's up for discussion if "empty" examples should fail or be treated more like a pending example   i lean towards failing them 
 dchelimsky  good question    anything actually  to give the code run under rspec to have an "environment" as similar to the one outside rspec  the outline  1  require 'rspec' detects symbols it doesn't know about  e g    simplecov   digest   multijson   erb   stringscanner   scanerror   cgi   datetime 2  rspec shows a warning about them  telling user to include 'rspec' first  or whitelist these symbols  3  rspec hooks into 'require'  recording changes  in  " and object constants  4  all constants that appeared from files not in given gem  e g  erb rb is not a file in simplecov gem  are removed 5  files are marked for reloading   " delete_if   file  file     erb rb    # for every file associated with above constants 6  rspec executes specs  which 'require' files as if for the first time 7  rspec re requires files if necessary after tests notes  i got the above working as a proof of concept on the example  i got just the "uninitialized constant"  erb  and only that error  simplecov works also  even though it uses at_exit   using constants+their files alone solves the issue  additionally this helps keep every   rb file self sufficient in its requires  even for basic things  like 'datetime'  'fileutils'  'yaml'  etc  this is especially important on gem upgrades  where dependencies are removed let me know if this is work working on and if there could be any major issues  e g  performance with constant reloading  accessing object methods  'require' monitoring overhead  ruby 1 8 compatibility  brittleness  etc  
webmock throughs an error that the stub hasn't been setup yet  when  subject  is called for  its   it attempts to make a real http connection which is blocked in my test suite  you can see my entire test suite here  https   github com threadedlabs trackerific there are very obvious places where it could use  its  foo    but can't 
 myronmarston could not get the above example to run  although this patch works for me https   github com deepak rspec core commit 71786157dad552d96a9cc7b4778278f0e8878aa1 has one failing feature  will patch and send a pr
this should result in the mentioned warning  we had this problem when a git diff was merged wrong  so the 2nd shared example ended up within the 1st 
i just read through the code  and i think it might be as simple as  record pending_fixed  true false   and reading that at the appropriate places  overloading the error object is in itself already a bit hacky  and since  record  is already being used to store all other metadata  it seems more in line with the rest of the code 
thank you for the explanation   and for the great work on rspec 
how about if  backtrace first  was excluded and isn't in  cleansed  
ok guys  this is the deal or what i think is the deal  i have a large java application that i'm testing using jruby rspec it seems that there's an object which spins up additional threads and maybe even a swing component in the background  i was attempting to add a piece of new functionality to some legacy section of code  this additional thread or whatever it is keeps hanging out and never returns so that particular example never completes  if i force an "exit 0" the example does complete with a failed status  it doesn't really seem like anything to do with rspec after all  any tricks you could think of to force an exit without auto failing the example 
 cupakromer i'll try that and give you some feedback once possible  thanks
hi  thanks for you respond  just for clarify  do a simple example to reproduce this case  1  add   lib addition rb 
yeah  absolutely  that sounds like a good approach  thank you for the detailed response  i'm traveling this week  so likely won't have much time to work on this  but when i return next week  i'll work on putting together a pr 
i didn't investigate much  tbh  but here's an issue i encountered  the following tests do not pass  unless one replaces the  example_group  with the subhash directly  or am i missing something 
that works  of course  my question is if an option like   disable filters makes sense  if so  i can dig into the code and make a pr  what do you guys think 
i have a bunch of tests that i would like to run as a prerequisite to other actions  e g  on startup run these tests before saying you are healthy   on certain specs  i do not want failures to stop the entire process  i could say  at_exit   exit 0      but then all specs exit with  0   and important ones that fail do not stop the process  the way i'm currently getting around this is by moving specs that are nonblocking when failing to a new file and adding the  at_exit   exit 0      but now i have very relevant specs split up between two files  i am a very big fan of the rspec dsl and would like to use it as a form of live integration testing in production  and this is at least one use case for the similar feature 
sorry about that  myronmarston   i wasn't sure if i should add that yet  i didn't want to put too much in the initial issue in case it got too cluttered
hi  benoittgt   for clarification  i'm feature requesting a _setting_ that allows  shared_examples_for  to fail in event of a conflict  instead of just a warning  the reason for this is gradual pollution we've noticed over the course of iterating on a very large codebase  hundreds of thousands of lines  over the years  when we run tests locally  we generally run individual tests in a small part of the code  this introduces no conflict  our ci runs them all  many tens of thousands of tests  together  with multiple instances of identically named  shared_examples_for   but the warnings have been ignored since there's so much log output and the builds are all green  as you know  the challenge with the failures is we could be accidentally introducing pollution without being aware of it  we think this sort of optional setting would help us make a more resilient rspec test suite  best  vaibhav
 benoittgt oh  sure  sorry  didn't noticed  done

not fugitive  it's an unrelated vim script that when i removed  seems to have caused everything to work  i wish i had known about   scriptnames  before  as i suspect this plugin may have been the result of other issues i encountered  thanks 
same problem with fugitive  the only other plugin active was pathogen  perhaps something in my vimrc https   github com graudeejs dot vim blob master vimrc i'll check if i have same problem at work  workspace is identical to what i have at home  but you never know

it will also discard unstaged changes as opposed to  git reset   hard head   which will only discard staged changes

i believe the current directory is a git repo  i have "set autochdir" on my _vimrc  i haven't been able to replicate the problem consistently  but whenever this happens  deleting vim fugitive and installing it again solves it  i am clueless 
 justinmk dirvish uses buftype nofile and netrw doesn't add to buffers either perhaps i misunderstood your question though
 viewoptions folds options cursor curdir 
all is well  the working copy is replaced with the version in the index and the buffer updates 
sorry to have bothered you and raised this issue  it was a misconfiguration on my side  i had defined   xdg_config_home  in my vimrc and changed the value to a temporary directory for testing purposes  therefore   git  did not consider my     config git config  
 mezhaka fyi  my partial vimrc   but sometimes  i find "not an editor command" yet  maybe i should remove fugitive auto commands  but i don't know how to do it 
hey  the issue is when i changed my fish to zsh  i have important project thus switched back to fish  cannot test it up until tomorrow
i'm seeing the weird scrolling behavior in  all  windows  that are alone in a tab   not just those created by fugitive commands    verbose nmap  c f   outputs  no mapping found   both   verbose set window   and   verbose set window  output  window 4

hi robbie  the rtl css should be loaded after the other css files are loaded  there should be one for the admin panel  and a separate one for each theme  the file should be loaded only if a rtl language is selected  this will enable me to make modifications to the rtl css file that will be  or mostly be  forward compatible  thank you very much for looking into this  once it is implemented i will be happy to do my best at adjusting the rtl of the admin and the main theme

 rjmackay thanks for replying  i am using the ushahidi 2 6 1 v  i am not used to kml layers but i guess that my kml is not complex it is just an image and a location on the map  like i said it shows nice on google maps maybe it is just a missing tag    thanks again 
'fraid not  this was originally brought to my attention from https   imagineartfairfax crowdmap com  which is a live site with several published reports  just published another one now to be sure and re saved the map settings as well 
yes  you were right    i had to do some tweaking with the web config file based on the modifications that were suggested for the  htaccess rewrite rules  this now works  awesome  thanks 
looks like that was the issue  thanks  i'm using the separate class definition approach   can you give an example  or preferably  test  where an anonymous structure type is used 
is it possible to change the implicit type param here https   github com slick slick blob master slick src main scala slick driver jdbcprofile scala#l55 to like this    if it's possible  i think it's the best change to fix this  but i am afraid of that it will break slick's design 
"does not work"      code compiles   code runs   if the date fields  created_at  updated_at  are used  like in method "updatenotworking"  the values in the db are not changed    code does not work + does not throw an exception or log anything  "i" "fixed" it by letting the slick codegen generate a schema for the table  the date fields are changed to java sql timestamps there  it looks like  so the problem is that slick seems not to be able to handle simple java util date fields  but is also not complaining about them    it just silently fails 
 cvogt  it would something like   or maybe put this in a stored procedure 
i was just confused about those two variants producing different queries  but after looking into it further the for comprehension is just desugared differently than i expected and there's no real issue here  thanks for your time 
yeah  i think so
 smootoo you may be correct here in suggesting that pg specific functions might be implemented in a slightly different fashion to prevent such issues  at the same time i will point out that  a  this is not the first occasion even in my limited experience when slick does not handle non standard types correctly  i have already run into https   github com slick slick issues 1446 in the past   and b  current implementation of window functions does work for plain types such as strings which is probably why the bug is still there  by the way you may see null checks elsewhere  e g  at https   github com slick slick blob master slick src main scala slick jdbc oracleprofile scala#l361  to me  this whole type processing issue demonstrates some design flaw which may yet manifest itself in more ways than one 
i'm on the master branch with the latest rails3 beta gem
same behavior in 1 3 0 and 1 3 1 
totally 
your suggestion works fine  sure it could be a little cleaner  but it works 
rails 3 1 0 beta1 and simple form 1 3 1
that seems like areasonable check  especially for the mappings discovered at the object scope  otherwise setting  config inputs_discovery   false  in the initializer fixes the issue but theres nothing about this anywhere in the readme or wiki  i just wonder how useful of a default this is  i suppose if overriding the default input types is common then fine but if other people stumble upon this conflict its a bit of a surprise to track down without diving into the code 
sorry about that     actually i was stupidly overriding the "date" key in my translation file   
sorry for the incomplete report  after some more investigation i found my mistake  i got confused by the config file that gets generated using the    bootstrap  option  it states  b use  html5  for the wrappers named   default  but then defines the   bootstrap  wrappers which doesn't use html5 and is then configured as the  default_wrapper   was it meant for the bootstrap forms to not be using html5 input types by default  
i think having any kind of consistency here would be a good thing  whether it be a space or not a space  padding can always be added through css once things are consistent 
the rendered html is this   i've tested it out further on multiple browsers and found it works in some cases and fails in others    it works ok in firefox  windows chrome  v18 0 102554 beta m  and even ie9  meaning there isn't a leading line break in the textarea  it fails in safari  v5 1 3 os x  v5 1 2 windows  and os x chrome  v17 0 963 78   producing a leading line break  where the content is on the second row of the textarea  in all cases the   #x000a   is rendered to the source  but it must be ignored in the browsers where it works ok 
i am sorry  i'll repost this to the mailing list 
yes  the form works without that field  stack trace  https   gist github com 4108228
hmm  it's working now  not sure exactly what happened  bundle update simple_form did not change gemfile lock when i just did it  i was under the impression that since i changed the simple_form line in my gemfile to get it from github rather than just get it from the gem server  a simple bundle install was sufficient  perhaps not    but anyway  it's working now  thanks 
my apologies  while creating a sample application  we found out that the bug was caused by an additional  internal gem  thank's anyway 
no i have not  i posted two questions about this on stackoverflow  but they yielded nothing    http   stackoverflow com questions 27529730 appending a unique id to simple form generated radio button inputs and a matchin   http   stackoverflow com questions 27406217 is there a way to adjust the class of a label for a radio button that was create
i was able to fix it  i was using the older version of gem 1 4 1 and perhaps it is incompatible with rails 4  once i used recent version of gem it was fixed  thanks 
a  bundle show  says    simple_form  1 4 1   is it deprecated  just to clarify  i want some defaults only in the nested form thanks ## aldo román nureña 2013 12 4 vasiliy ermolovich notifications github com
oops  my bad  i'm confusing with my code which uses another form       f button  submit  'save'    i'll close this 
i hadn't specified a version  changed to gem 'simple_form'  '3 0 2'  ran bundle update and all is well  thanks  ed
that would probably be really tricky since this is an extremely elaborate application  do you have any recommendations for how i can try debugging simple_form 
hey rafael  short answer  nope  which is embarrassing  pretty sure it's to do with this  https   github com plataformatec simple_form issues 828 using  value_method   to_sym  "fixes" the problem  but i'll need to figure out the actual cause  for now i'll just stick with  3 0 3   i'll reopen this if i can get a sample app going  sorry for the bother   hopefully this helps other people experiencing the same issue 
i will try to create one in the coming days  here are some so discussions that may help  http   stackoverflow com questions 8207772 jquery dropdown date validation rq 1 http   stackoverflow com questions 14992845 simple form date not working after the 12th of each month rq 1#comment21277099_14992862  mine  http   stackoverflow com questions 24409283 simpleform jquery validation plugin for dates

oops my mistake please ignore  posted in wrong window project
you're right  that's not ideal    i'll take a look and see if there's a nice solution 
running  mopidy deps  gives me the same error 
 mopidy   list deps  gives me the same inputerror  here's what pacman tells me though 
 jodal basic idea is to enable some sort of remote library  that can be accesed over internet or lan   i'am already using beets to manage my library and as such i am leaning towards beets client for now  about pr  beets also has http api insecure at the moment   the above pr is simple implementation of beets client  further down the road  i would like to add more secure implementation ssl and auth   but that means adding some code to beets web plugin  https   github com sampsyo beets blob master beetsplug web __init__ py   but before i do that  there needs to be somewhat usable client 
i'm not sure  my problem is that if the internet goes off for more than about a minute the radio doesn't come back without user intervention  what i would like it do is for the radio to automatically restart  whether the internet disconnects for 2 minutes or 20 minutes  does #715 relate to this 
nope  i'm planning to serve a non minified version of mopidy mopify  forgot to mention  when an user starts mopidy in verbose mode  but i just googled a bit better and it turned out that i can easily grab the parameters using  optparse   this should do the trick for as far as i can see 
yes  that's correct  mopidy 1 0 5  running  mopidy deps    in aforementioned configuration   yes  although i have tested only a few mp3 tracks  curiously i've got mopidy on rpi and cannot reproduce this error 
the latest in apt repo  1 1 0
may be
i use mopidy mobile and musicbox web client 
ah my mistake  it seems it's a dependency of sphinx  which is used to generate the documentation  has nothing to do with mopidy  sorry  wink 
both frontends  hardly responsive to completely unresponsive  always differs from day to day  and where would i find the debug log  i can only find   var log mopidy mopidy log 
yeah  that makes perfect sense as to why  i agree it would be 'easy' to write rulefor without the parameter  but i cannot think of another way to get it done  i think it is would be a great feature just like you have it though   
 jeremyskinner i also have not been able to replicate the problem using a test even when using foreach  let me double check what is going on in my application    
 jeremyskinner i'm sorry  i just managed to reproduce the error and it's not related to fluentvalidation at all  it seems that unobtrusive validation has a real problem with  jquery 3 1 1 slim   i don't know exactly why  another thing that contributed to my poor diagnostic was using bootrap v4 modal  that doesn't play nice with unobtrusive validation  chrome's violent cashing is no help for testing too   one thing though that i spotted during the frenetic script testing was that  emailaddress    only triggers validation if you check for  notempty    before hand  is that right 
no  it's pretty much what i've shown already  one single outer object  with a property that is a collection of objects  the validation message returned to the user of the api can contain multiple  email cannot be empty  messages  and it's hard for the user to find the right user missing an email address   so two riddles  really  1  why are we not getting the  user 0  email should not be empty  type of message  2  what can be done with  expression  and  memberinfo  to get hold of the current users name
yes  i have the  import fluentvalidation   i may be sol    there doesn't appear to be a way  to my knowledge  to utilize a generic ivalidator that plays nice with inotifypropertychanged in a generic base class for my models  here's what i have   makes sense that it doesn't work since it doesn't know that "this" is of type t    be nice if i could use the non generic ivalidator  but i recall reading something on codeplex that it wasn't a direction fluentvalidation wanted to go  i'm trying to create a base class so that i don't have to customize each one of my models to get validation with idataerrorinfo
sorry jeremy   had a total brain failure today  got it to work  nevermind this issue   
this is my model class   all validation rules    validator typeof employeevalidator    public class employee   public int id   get  set    public string name   get  set    public int age   get  set    public string email   get  set    public string url   get  set       little bit confused that what should i use in place of " " rulefor x    x id  notnull   withlocalizedmessage         
after hours of fun i think i found workaround for this  i have created a filter which does this  it is almost the same in method  and in startup class   services addscoped ivalidatorfactory  serviceprovidervalidatorfactory      and now it works just fine 
i'm not wiring them like for the other validators and they work  public class mymodelvalidator   abstractvalidator mymodel             should i register them in ioc container 
ok  thank you for your explanations  yes  this solution suits me perfectly 
so to achieve the desired effect i'd have make my own validator that derives from  propertyvalidator  and use that to create my  validationfailure  instead of doing  new validationfailure   is that understood correctly 
i only wish to set the validator for the current entry if an access check does not fail  ruleforeach x    x pilotages   setvalidator x    pilotageinformationvalidator   when  vm  pilotage      pilotageinformationvalidator validate pilotage  ruleset  rulesets access  errors any     does this make sense 
 jeremyskinner   very interesting    it returns all the errors when using validate directly  this must be something to do with how modelstate works  thanks a lot for your help  i'll investigate this further     edit  modelstate seems to work fine with data annotations on the properties instead  must be something to do with the example i followed  although i'm not sure what

how to set rules to make  validate thing  rulesetname  to be false 
if your model specifies a non nullable reference type  why would you want to write   i could see this being considered a bad idea in that it might actually make the api harder to use  but i was thinking it would make it easier to use  just an idea at this point   they haven't even released it yet 
hi  jeremyskinner   thank for your support  currently we accept this minor bug  it may be from our project  not related to the fluentvalidation 
hi jimmy this is my implementation  the first 4 rulefor works fine but the last rulefor do not work  what i noticed is that as long the first rulefor was satisfied the last validation rule was ignored  something like that   img width "480" alt "validator" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 23208910 48663172 1cf4d900 eac7 11e8 9c72 dc00d247a151 png"  this is how i display the validation message in chtml using   asp validation for    img width "541" alt "chtml" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 23208910 48663173 1cf4d900 eac7 11e8 837c bf615591d668 png" 
i will wait to see the answer to the issue i posted at the asp net core repository and will decide if i will have to manually validate the view model  thank you for the help jeremy 
those are the validators classes   also  i'm not saying that validating child properties not working at all  it only this case  polymorphic behaviour  
registrationresources btnonclickbuttonagree   resx property
sure thing   looks like maybe some kind of autofac registration coming in  not doing anything with fv in there though  startup i'm using is attached to op

hey desandro  when you resize the browser until there are two items in a row  untill the width of the browser is 940 px     you 'll see that spaces between items are not same  there is a bigger blue area between some items  i want it to be standart 
yes  i will soon 
okay thank you  ill do it
hey david  thanks for your answer  i didn't now about the reduced test case  so i wrote a bit about it  i isolated my code  and what i seen is that  the masonry plugin is only loading when i acces my page typing the url  when i click the link via my navbar the pluging doesn't load  any idea  jérémy  le 25 nov  2013 à 00 13  david desandro a écrit  
but that is what i did    i provided the html   css   jquery    what else is missing so i can include it  
ok will try   
my problem is about after performance of replacing layout loaded  not loading new masonry layout  i am afraid that theeluwin's suggestion is not for my case  but thanks  i will check airbnb infinite way too 
this is example   http   web2 tomaspetrecek cz  6th and 7th post from top is bad  when you inspect html code and what order do you see  i think it is good example  thank you 
i will try to create a reduced test case that has the issue  if i am unable to replicate i will try to troubleshoot as best i can  thanks for the help

hey  desandro sorry for topic it was not about masonry basically we had some attributes on img tag  that safari doesn't understand 
hi  using the composer assets plugin from fxp francois    yii2 framework
hi  i've created a reduced test case   http   codepen io longestdrive pen bnmjwe i can replace the items once but repeating this corrupts the layout  click the 1st button then the 2nd button   then try the buttons again to see the corruption
sorry for problem  i solved problem which was in div nesting  issue to close    ps  thanks for show me 'reduced test case'  there is very usefull in debbuging

hi  i'm sorry for my late response  i tried to handle the situation with css  i'm a little busy now to provide a reduced test case now  thanks anyways 
hi desandro  thanks a lot for your efforts and time  about removing the item without masonry  we are talking about image files   each file could be uploaded intoa server and the related data   filename   are stored into a database  each filename gets its own id into the db table  right now the user page shows a table   ajax based    each row has its id data  removing a table row using jquery i can read the related id and send a call to the server where a php script remove file from filesystem and delete database data  i don't understand if i can attach an id data to each masonry element and how can i send this data to the server  sorry for my poor english and hope i explained my issue 
finally  i fixed it
hmm i'll try to see if i can come up with a better report  no open web example at the moment  but will see what i can do  thanks  on wed  nov 7  2012 at 2 44 am  robert buels notifications github comwrote

ok so the problem was my server  i was using python  bottle  http   bottlepy org docs dev   as server and then serve jbrowse as a proxypass on apache  i just serve jbrowse home directory via apache directly and then it's works without any problems   so my mistake  thank you for your help  +1 
yes it does  so it seems to be on my side  i tested other clients  ubuntu  windows on chrome and firefox browsers  but it seems to be client independent  i installed the volvox test database on my server  ubuntu 12 04   but it has the same problem  i copied the whole jbrowse directory to a redhat machine  but it seems to have the problem there as well 
i tried to using the   tracktype canvasfeatures option  as before  i can't remove the track feature  exon  on gene track 
tested the public jbrowse instance again on ie version 11 0 9600 17914 today  and the error does not seem to be reproducible now  previously  we tested multiple ie 11 machines that encountered this same issue  but perhaps a recent ie update resolved the underlying problems  closing this ticket  apologies for any associated headache s

yes  we have a circular hpv viral genome with very defined numbering 1 7857  which is integrated in the human genome at position 4000 in the virus  we'd like to be able to maintain the reference numbers of the original virus sequence in the j browse display  so it should really be 4001 7857 1 4000  is there a way to change the numbering display  the actual nucleotide sequence is correct  it's just that the numbers don't match the original virus reference numbers  elements in the virus are named according to these numbers  for example  p105 is the early promoter at nucleotide 105  thanks for your help 
 cmdcolin yes  it is still happening  no matter what jbrowse instance it's running

sorry for taking so long to respond  i've done some more measurements outside of my program and i will say that even with a 50kb html  which i would count as big  you basically don't see the difference  patch or not  my idea was that the key is when the application is under memory pressure  on android devices have from 12 to 32mb max heap size so you quickly reach that limit  so if the program is under memory pressure from something else  the extra overhead from this gc churn could theoretically slow down the application  obviously when i submitted the patch i suspected you might ask me about measurements  the reason i didn't include them is that it's hard to reproduce  also i was hoping you had some test suite that could help you to reproduce yourself  now i have modified my application to reduce its memory use so i can't reproduce the problem  which was far from happening all the time anyway   also i can't make a reliable measurement that would prove it's worth it  so at this point i would say that the new code is probably better but you must probably hit a very specific situation for the difference to be measurable  given the use case of jsoup the difference from that patch is probably in all but very strange cases impossible to measure compared to the network latency  i have made a couple of test programs  both ran on my htc desire 2 2   1  load in memory over 500 times the icon of the application to reach almost out of memory then parse the html from http   lwn net articles 454305 bigpage five times and time it   no major difference  patch or not  2  start parsing that same webpage in three different threads concurrently and 3 times in a row in each thread and measure it  there i got minor differences  but i think not worth mentioning  unpatched       08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43383 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43911 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   44041 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43629 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   44137 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43488 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43517 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   44042 08 19 15 13 45 736  debug jsouptest 24018   parse duration  ms   43741 patched       08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   42468 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41756 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41303 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   42226 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41634 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41512 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   42369 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41779 08 19 15 17 54 286  debug jsouptest 24071   parse duration  ms   41146 could easily be noise from the other processes running on the phone  note the measurements are printed in random order   note that of course i'm measuring only the parsing not the fetching  connection connection   jsoup connect "http   lwn net articles 454305 bigpage"   connection timeout connection_timeout_ms   response response   connection execute    long now   calendar getinstance   gettimeinmillis    response parse    long now2   calendar getinstance   gettimeinmillis    so i think in the end if you consider that the patch makes the code less readable  which i probably does  just reject it  i regret opening this bug now  without having measured and proven to myself that it does make a measurable difference 
actually i tried that too  earlier  but it didn't seem to be that way  for example  if i have this html code   i assume the method gets confused by the different levels of html code  if i do "marker getelementsbyindexgreaterthan" instead of "marker parent getelementsbyindexgreaterthan" in the most recent example  i get an "empty set"   didn't mean to close this  i pressed the wrong button it seems  sorry about that  
thank for your comment  i'm not suggesting that jsoup should absolutely adhere to the spec whaver it says  i think we all know from experience that specs are not always right and sometimes we must go sideways   br   however  i consider that jsoup should ensure that the html  or xhtml  _output_ is always valid  clean  if requested   and above all compatible with the most common parser browser  and unfortunately  ie8 is one of them  br   and if it is not in its standard configuration  which i would understand for backward compatibilty issues even though it's not what i would choose      it should probably be nice to provide the api to ease custom configuration  as requested in #163   my suggestion would be to always output  amp #39  when using escapemode xhtml  instead of existing apos entity  apos would still be valid when parsed of course   the following commit is a fix for this issue that i think is proper behavior   4e59c908fdeda9032c5a14c7e934fe26c08438bf  my apologize for not submitting a pull request i'm not yet familar enough with github   
here the example i had problem with  the html code is  meta content ""iced tea   home" set" name "title"  i select with  elements ideaelement   entrydoc select "meta name "   and get the string with  string idea   ideaelement first   attr "content"  tostring    if there are no " in the content string  it works fine  else the select statement is empty  if i print out all the elements via  for  element curelement   ideaelement    system out print curelement tostring   + " n"     then on elements where select isn't working probably i get  meta content "" iced "" tea ""   "" home" "" set" "" name "title"   if there are no " in the content attribute everything works fine  it selects the correct string from content and prints it out 
great  thanks 
hello  i am doing the following 
i wrote an issue because it seemed that the test case value did not come out correctly during checking the code   in this case  'p' returns a null value  it seems some mistake  data function output of the element seems the desired value " a one  a "  
i want to escape unsafe tags instead of remove them  i extend from whitelist to make issafetag and issafeattribute public  then i traverse document modifying all nodes based on whitelist  i also have cases where default behaviour  delete unsafe  is fine  so i'd like to use whitelist as intented and also as a source of information about safe unsafe tags 
ok  here they are     html 
i want to put it in spring ioc 
in my code i get the html of the entire page using volley through a post request and then i send the response html string to  jsoup parse   i heard somewhere that there's actually a size limit for using jsoup to read directly from a web page  that's i why i mentioned  connection maxbodysize   is there any size limit for the string passed to  jsoup parse   if there's such limit  how to increase it just like  connection maxbodysize  
oops  i downloaded it from your github repository  just installed the one off of google code and it seems to be working now

sorry  done  btw  for reference i posted the question in so  http   stackoverflow com questions 20430449 django haystack edgengramfield given different results than elasticsearch 20438034 noredirect 1#20438034
i would love to help and provide the log  but apparently i'm too dumb to enable logging in elasticsearch  i've configured logging yml and elasticsearch yml i start elasticsearch with   but apparently the config file does not get loaded  the path of the config file is 100  ok  however i couldn't really find good documentation what the parameter is to load the config file  running here osx 10 9 with oracle java 
partially  now the same exception occurs line 66  but catching the exception is indeed the solution 
after exchanging the backend with elasticsearch  it works  previously  i used whoosh   it seems somehow related with http   stackoverflow com questions 10454367 haystack queryset contains none elements  i've got no time to write a test case for it  but i'll try to give it later 
 acdha you still didn't fix the original issue  whenever you install django haystack it automatically uses the latest version of django  since it's incompatible with 1 10 all setups from that point in time will fail  you need to limit the django version in setup py  a lower and upper limit should be added  to ensure people actually have compatible django versions
the bug is easily reproducible with above program on paramiko 1 5 12  under docker in order not to mess my environment  ubuntu 14 04  
running "sudo pip install cryptography   upgrade" seems to have solved the problem for me  thank you  
need to add the fix mzakharo paramiko 6e979ea in code  then passwordless are supported
i have cryptography 2 8 
sure  sorry  corrected  that's the fact    pg x  query get the number of the  grand_total  despite the  limit  value within the  article  tag and txp renders blank pages  exceeded results   in substance  it's not so easy to get paginations within txp   grand_total  is correct  but   thispage 'numpages'   seems to be wrong     please  try different contexts

hi  kocolosk and thanks for getting back  i might have been wrong in saying that the entire is returned  but definitely there is something wrong  because this number is growing  now what is strange is that on the same documents that i used to investigate this scenario the replication is now started returning a very small number  like 9   but it steadily increased to 40 after possible 31 operations  didn't count exactly   so what i'm thinking is that was somehow cleaned by some scheduled maintenance job  but i will attach 2 versions of the response i got for the same request  not subsequent but in time after a certain number of operations   and i am counting the start_last_seq    "source"  "http   sa go localhost 5984 central" "target"  "http   sa go localhost 5984 userdb 61" "doc_ids"    "l_303381cf64f141f28a316b400b8a3cbb_org couchdb user t"     26_start_last_seq txt  https   github com apache couchdb files 2504277 26_start_last_seq txt   40_start_last_seq txt  https   github com apache couchdb files 2504280 40_start_last_seq txt  hope it helps 
hi  wohali   thanks for your response  without upgrading couchdb  i checked the line  bash  tmp baby  in  local ini     default ini  and it's not there  then i checked below file and uncomment and restarted  but facing the same issue   it didn't help  could you please let me know "how can i upgrade to couchdb 2 3 0 or 2 3 1 without current couchdb data loss" 
i can try  but ¿it's "sum" necessary for the result that i want  i want count all documents from this data base 
we haven't run any metrics on request time as yet  we are purely going off load times for our front end website  we run an ecommerce site  and the product pages pull the product data directly from couchdb  when indexing or data insertion is occurring  the pages load very slowly  when there are no active tasks in couchdb  they load near instantly  the problem is highlighted moreso when running a search on the site  searches return multiple products  so pulling the data for these takes a long time when couchdb is indexing  happy to run some metrics if anyone can advise the best way to do this  thanks 
thank you for the response  what do you mean by mailing list  i was of the impression that if the diff between the database and view purge sequences is greater than 1  a complete rebuilding of the indexes will take place which would ideally update the indexes properly  this piece of code reflects the same  https   github com apache couchdb couch index blob master src couch_index_updater erl#l204 i am not sure how purging a conflicting revision tree could change this though  haven't tested this on 2 x i will do that and update the results here

here's the pull request  https   github com capistrano capistrano pull 179 i really think a change like this should have been rejected until    the goal is detailed in a document  worth a blog post   than a single line commit message   or added some tests for what is expected and what is not   breaking changes are properly warned   it also changes the log format of scp   sftp   it has sane defaults for newbies i think capistrano is a mature product that many people from newbies to gurus depend on  and breaking changes should be handled more carefully  also  lacking the documentation for changes makes it really hard to determine how to improve for contributors like myself  i had several ideas to do better than optionalizing the verbose logging  but i couldn't because i really don't know what the original change was intended for  thus i had to "add" an option on top of that  which i think will make the further changes even harder   it's a bright path to a bloatware  i think we should let  new features work hard to be implemented  http   gettingreal 37signals com ch05_start_with_no php   rather than the other way around 
it breaks the editor in production  when i rollback the capistrano version and deploy again  the editor works ok 
 kirs updated comment  sorry my comment was lost   
hello  thank you very much for your suggestions  but honestly i am not even sure if this is capistrano related or capistrano multiconfig  i am working on a application that needs to use celluloid actors to deploy multiple applications on multiple servers in parallel  the only thing that worked for me was that after i instantiated the object with capistrano  application new to loop through each of the files from lib directory of all capistrano related gems and using this code to load each file which is a very dirty ugly and messy thing   i did find out actually a better way of doing this   instead of using capistrano  application new and trying to load the tasks inside that object  i am using sub processes where i can run easily a shell command and that seems to work just fine  i think this can be closed  thank you very much for your help and taking the time to answer my question 
yeah i do think some commands are being run twice  not sure what you mean by compose or file permissions 
 leehambley i'm using puma server and  capistrano3 puma  gem which provides some tasks to start  stop and restart the server  one problem with  restart  is that capistrano 3 doesn't roll back anymore  so if one host has a failed smoke test  the rest of the hosts won't be restarted  however  all the host will have the latest code and it makes the manual restart ugly  any thoughts on this 
yes  we need to compile java code war and jar  and upload it to tomcat 
yeah that would erase the cleartext password  warning  however the deploy still don't work 
we tested the better solution from  mattbrictson  should this also be fixed to   r  # regexp quote vs        if someone wants to define some roles using a     maybe "somerole somesubrole"
thanks for your help  git gc really helps it has been compressed to 133m  like it was cloned for the first time  will 'git gc' bring a new surprises in future deployments 
let me give you a bit more details about my case  the code was pushed to gitlab but capistrano config was still referencing the old repo  this a takeover project   the code was deployed  then  i changed the repo url because i realized that my predecessors forgot to update capistrano repo url which should be pointing to the gitlab repo  not their own gitlab instance  i updated the repo url in capistrano and tried to deploy but it errored out  i looked at repo folder on the remote host and the repo url was from before my update  i do not have the logs anymore  sorry  this interesting  because  as you mentioned  the change has been already implemented but something is still not working  the case described here #1826 is the same as mine so    very interesting   
will do 
i'm talking about building 
the production url that is still on the server  the debug url no longer is  the update fails  failed  on my development machine  on a different machine the update worked fine  somewhere on my system the debug and defunct url is stored and  the old version of  sparkle uses that instead of what is in its own info plist 
the first part is output from  bestvalidupdateinappcast forupdater   where i'm trying to figure out which update is appropriate to install  also  i should've mentioned the updated app is in a dmg  "bookbuilder" is my app  here is system log 
i don't know why sparkle doesn't pick up the user default  does it get a chance to run before applicationwillfinishlaunching   i don't know if i would advocate for anyone else handling beta feeds the way iterm2 does it  where betas can update to finals and finals can update to betas based on a user setting  i think these days most users expect everything to behave like chrome where there are distinct channels  i suppose i should just implement the  feedurlstringforupdater   delegate method  i've been avoiding sparkle's delegate interface out of extreme risk aversion  the only remaining part to this issue is by what mechanism sparkle is not picking up the user defaults value  i don't think it's a 1 100000 occurrence related to locking user prefs—there are dozens of crashes 
what's the proper value for  path to update pkg   is that the zip file i publish in my appcast 
i'm using dsa keys 
we currently are using an in house custom version of sparkle  so creating a pull request from that isn't possible  not sure when i'll have time to look at the official branch  thus the bug report 
yes  i did run the apps more than once  please note that this is "automaticallydownloadupdates" and not "automaticallycheckforupdates" 
hi pornel  properties specific to my app  i have a few settings in my app  that i need to update after the download is complete  few logic in my code will leverage on this app settings  for example  i don't want my app to do a few things  if an update is downloaded 
i'm using the app store version of xcode 8  i just emptied the deriveddata folder  and now it's complaining about xctest  i've added that framework to every target because why not  removing xctest from all but the test targets  and adding libxar  libz  and libbz2 to the unit test  and test app fixed it 
the only error i could find on the suupdater sandboxviolation  optios 5169  deny mach lookup com apple nsurlstorage cache violation  deny mach lookup com apple nsurlstorage cache process  optios  5169  path   applications optios app contents macos optios load address  0x1060b7000 identifier  net optios optios version  1       code type  x86_64  native  parent process  launchd  1  responsible   applications optios app contents macos optios  5169  user id  501
yeah  a   gitignore  file  easy fix   
maybe  though right now i can't figure out how to get my app to shut itself down but still apply the update   nsapplication sharedapplication terminate nsapplication sharedapplication    doesn't seem to be stopping it  and invoking "launchctl unload" on my daemon doesn't appear to apply the update 
we didn't originally when i opened this issue  have worked around it by using  git submodule update   init  and adding a dependency to the sparkle xcode project for bsdiff ed25519  this commit is in our fork  here  https   github com brave sparkle pull 8 commits 577eee9cbf955b4dd39746b4f03a1944fcd323fd   i'll close this issue as its not blocking us any longer  but wanted to document the solution for others 
no all i did was download the entire midiapps ws and build the two applications  they both use sparkle to update  prior to doing the build step i followed the instructions to git submodule update   init   recursive  i contacted mr revis with the issues and he said i could ignore them and that it might be a sparkle configuration issue  i'm long retired from sw dev but like to keep my hand in and learn things  so i thought to dig into this and see if i could get rid of the warnings  i looked at the xcode build  xconfig settings for sparkle ed25519 and they are simple  warning_cflags     inherited   wno cast qual  wno conversion  wno sign conversion  the dependncy analysis log warnings refer to "no rule to process       for x86_64" but valid_archs for target ed25519 are i386 x86_64 and archs is   archs_standard  so i'm a bit puzzled as to where else to look      p s  i examined the file type using xcode file inspector pane and it shows default   c header p p s  i also checked the build settings build rules system c rule which is default c compiler
doing this may break any code that is expecting the value for  susystemprofilercpucountkey   for example  to be a number  which makes sense  maybe changing the type of dictionary would be a safer option  also  searching for      w+    in the codebase reveals many cases where an  nsnumber  is treated as a string or assigned to a string variable

the     mix a   is not the important part  the important part is that the interpolation naively brings in the  inspect  form of the regex including the surrounding      i think as along as the original regex  source  is interpolated without the surrounding      it should be alright 
sure  once got the full featured and fast enough ruby engine in the browser developers will want to build their apps in a more rubyish way  and they will port all the jquery 2 0 functions in a moment  but  it is all about future  as of today  we may construct such an easy way to talk to js world so nobody could even notice the switch to ruby except for ruby's programmer friendliness    i do not know how could we accomplish such a complex goal  but i do think hard on it  the best solution may to be the ruby engine allowing ruby code to call js seamlessly  or an automated tool to build  jquery js rb  with a click of a button  there are tons of libraries and a language for a browser could die silently without a support for those  no one can handle this amount of machine work on porting everything  especially for a new language with a bunch of questions about its future  ruby didn't win the server  but js did certainly win the client  somehow we have to use the power of js for our need

changing the value true to true did the trick  yesod does not try to migrate the default value anymore  however  i experimented with a text field  i added a new field  "language"  to user table     snip    user ident text password text maybe authorized bool default true language text default 'fi' uniqueuser ident    snip    the initial migration works as expected  starting devel application devel application launched  http   localhost 3000 migrating  alter table "user" add column "language" varchar not null default 'fi' however  on subsequent executions  the default value is migrated again  starting devel application devel application launched  http   localhost 3000 migrating  alter table "user" alter column "language" set default 'fi' the postgresql schema is following  id   integer   not null default nextval 'user_id_seq'  regclass  ident   character varying   not null password   character varying   authorized   boolean   not null default true language   character varying   not null default 'fi'  character varying it does not seem to be possible to specify 'fi''  character varying as the default value due to the white space  any ideas on how i could specify a default value for a text field without repeated database migrations upon startup 
thank's for the fast reply  so the first point is solved  but for the second i still have no clue    if i'm creating a new scaffolding site with postgres  the same database as for my current site  and changing config postgres yml to address my postgres server  i'm receiving the same error 
hmm  okay  yesod 1 2 0 1 installs if i specify it  however  yesod platform is only available at 1 2 0  which depends on yesod 1 2 0  seems like a simple update to the dependency might fix it  then 
updated  thank you for your great work by the way  it would be great if there was some kind of documentations for yesod eventsource that seem to solve this very same problem but in a more integrated way 
thanks  it still eats a surprising amount of memory  but now at least it's tractable  i wonder if this is related to the ghc bug where it eats huge amounts of memory in the presence of more that a few kilobytes of data in literals in a single module  unfortunately  with  staticfileslist  our web programmers now need to edit a haskell module every time they make any changes to the  static  directory  it would be nice to have a version of  staticfiles  that also takes an exclude list parameter 
these are just grep results for "config "    yesod bin addhandler hs  modify "config routes"   fixroutes name pattern methods   yesod bin keter hs  let yml   "config keter yml"   yesod bin keter hs  return   if ymlexists then yml else "config keter yaml"   yesod yesod default handlers hs getfaviconr   sendfile "image x icon" "config favicon ico"   yesod yesod default handlers hs getrobotsr   sendfile "text plain" "config robots txt"   yesod yesod default config hs    csfile   _    return "config settings yml"   yesod yesod default config2 hs configsettingsyml   "config settings yml"
right now it's interpolation inside another widget file 
yes  that fixes it  thanks 
no  i'm using ghc 7 6 3 from the gentoo haskell overlay  that's also where i got cabal from 
yep  looks good 
sure
yes  i do that https   github com yesodweb wai issues 336
there's actually a bunch of stuff going on  including ajaxy calls in case you want to attach  i e  upload the file  ahead of saving the form  you can actually have a look how it acts by  spinning  https   simplytest me project drupal  up a  free   disposable  drupal 8 site  and after the quick installation  go to   node add article  where you will have an image field to experiment with the functionality and behavior  i think it would make sense to add it to the existing file field code 
yep windows  that ticket is only to add some better diagnostics for segfaults  which would help but not fix it

hello  sorry for taking too long  the version is 105 1 0 0  and  net 4  i´ll try to get in the source code to check what´s going on too  thank you very much 
it is a brand new machine running debian64 bit 7 8 running the latest stable version of mono develop   i git pulled the solution  and compiled it with sharpdevelop on windows  i then copy the binaries via ftp to the debian machine then run it in a ssh session  i can send you the sources of the test project i have added to sharpdevelop  i already checked that it is not a firewall permission issue   so the same request is working fine with curl 
my time zone is +8 00  when i post datetime type data '2016 5 1 8 00' to webapi  it will change to '2016 5 1 0 00'
so  i found the workaround    apparently  request addparameter "content type"  "application json"   does not work  which meant my request body was not in json  http   itanex blogspot co at 2012 02 restsharp and advanced post requests html had a solution to this  is there a more 'standard' way to add the content type header

it's the sample code of mailgun for batch sending  you can see it here https   documentation mailgun com en latest user_manual html#batch sending selectcing c#  basically it's this one   restclient client   new restclient     client baseurl   new uri  "https   api mailgun net v3"   client authenticator   new httpbasicauthenticator  "api"  "your_api_key"   restrequest request   new restrequest     request addparameter  "domain"  "your_domain_name"  parametertype urlsegment   request resource   " domain  messages"  request addparameter  "from"  "excited user  you your_domain_name "   request addparameter  "to"  "alice example com"   request addparameter  "to"  "bob example com"   request addparameter  "subject"  "hey   recipient first "   request addparameter  "text"  "if you wish to unsubscribe  click http   mailgun unsubscribe  recipient id '"   request addparameter  "recipient variables"  "  "bob example com "    "first "  "bob "   "id " 1    "alice example com "    "first "  "alice "   "id "  2  "   request method   method post  return client execute  request   this code is written to send multiple mail with a template  in my case the last addparameter "recipient variable"       has as a value a big string of about 500k  if i don't cut it at 64k  i get an error  after googling for some time  i found a post who says that the error is caused by this update of the code https   github com restsharp restsharp commit f67044f829c21e9455141b2c4ca8d5ff04c0e987#diff 0 each parameter is encoded using uri escapedatastring which as the 64k limit  since an uri can't be longer then 64k  so every parameter you give to restsharp can be bigger then 64k  you can test it whi every rest api  when you exec client execute you get the error  and the api is not called  you can check it with fiddler  there's no call  ps  sorry for the unformatted code  it's the first time i write an issue  and i don't know how to format it 
by client code i meant the c# code that i pasted in the above post 
maybe there's a misunderstanding  i feel like what i'm asking is a very common use case  the documentation always maps classes 100  to the rest api  for example in the serialization page 
thank you  adityamagadi for your effort  i would start to look at this loop where the  xmldeserializer  loops through the properties  https   github com restsharp restsharp blob 370659dd1061c85e416c8915a7e09abf12db8882 src restsharp serializers xml xmldeserializer cs#l97 if an  exception  is thrown while deserializing a property  it would be great to catch it  and re throw it with the  prop name  and  prop type  values  or even with the string value that we couldn't deserialize in the error message

 peterjc thank you for reply  i know it  but i want to pass for this entry  becuase   sometimes  when i download the genbank from ncbi using api  some record had premature end  so  i want to pass for premature entry   like try   except in python  could you suggest the code related to this issue  
the current exception tells quite specific what's wrong and indicates the premature ending of the file   function  but upon a stopiteration proceed by returning the record instead of aborting by raising an exception 
yes  i can remove this entry safely and be happy using  ripgrep  again  but raising this issue was more intended to remove this from the master here so that any people after me using  ripgrep  while working on this repo won't encounter the same issue  as it is rather hard to figure out on your own why  ripgrep  does not work  and it is unlikely this is really a file extension that is in use

this will not work as you won't get vertical cladogram or free layout graphics with  phylo draw   and the examples are specifically there to show these modes  in #1247  draw_graphviz  was deprecated before any replacement was implemented  i can see that it's not strictly necessary to have other than horizontal cladograms  but we're talking about these specific parts of the tutorial now  going with #1247 i'm not interested in fixing the pydot issue

hi   thanks for the suggestion but i'm affraid this solution only works for "edit"  "update"  "destroy" actions    the solution you are suggesting needs a record to work  when you call "create"  "new" or "index"  you don't have a record and therefore you can only determine the abilities by other means  like the user's role or request ip or whatever  in the railscast  it works because the article being commented is never a criteria for creating or listing comments 
dapi  excellent comments here  i like the technique you're using in  ability rb   i'm still thinking about situations like this   i think you're on to something with your  can_touch_attributes  macro  but i can think of several examples where i'd want permission based on the action attribute combination  not just the attribute alone 
rtfm  thanks ryan 
well  i had this in my  userscontroller  authorize_resource reason being that i restrict the line of code which sets the instance variable to select only certain columns and since  load_and_authorize_resource  sets the instance variable  i thought i should use  authorize_resource  instead  i just tested it out and it seems that i can use  load_and_authorize_resource  and set my own instance variable  is that correct 
thanks for your quick response  i have a table filled with gps data   each one marked by a lat  long  timestamp that belongs to a user  so i want to pull data back data based on user   but i never want to pull back all the records  that would be too much   generally all data returned should have their timestamp fall between a start_date and end_date
debugging abilities really worked  it was a very small mistake  the order of writing the abilities was wrong  thanks for your help 
yes  yes it does  thank you very much  one more slight issue   question keeping this from perfection if i may   currently every user still shows up in the instance variable of the index action  if a moderator tries to edit a higher ranked user  it will ban them from doing so  but i'd like to clean it up and not show unauthorized users in the index list to begin with  i tried using the following in the index action of my controller which i was sure was going to do the trick     users   user accessible_by current_ability  order 'created_at desc'  but what is returned is "the accessible_by call cannot be used with a block 'can' definition  the sql cannot be determined for  read user       " is there a way to get around that 
indeed  the check is unneeded and cancan already has the proposed behaviour  thanx 
thanks for the answer and the help  still  however  i am not quite sure how to use  all  so i want the user to be able to update everything in the application  i'd set this in the database  action  update  subject_class  all  when i add this row  i get the error "uninitialized constant all"  should i change permission subject_class constantize to if permission subject_class downcase     "all" permission subject_class downcase  to_sym else permission subject_class constantize end   i think i am still missing the point of  all  am i not  edit  this seems to work    is this also the way it should work 
nope  nothing  no sql related to cancan  usually  if you don't authorize manually or l a  cancan will issue a insufficientcheck exception  not a unauthorized one  actually  according to the doc   should work because we are instructing cancan to let user access all actions of customersalescontroller   
yes  that's a real confidence booster  especially that you're using it in production     thanks 
i will try  on  taskcontroller#index  view i only want to display current_user tasks  if the user is a moderator he she will see all tasks since the permission for moderators is  can  read task   i have to give this permission moderators since on  taskmoderatorcontroller#index  moderators should be able to view all tasks  or shorter 
 fillman i'm not sure what you mean  your code quote is about hash conditions with a block  which is a stated limitation of cancan  thus we can only pass sql conditions with a block  this has a clear intended use case  fetching a set of readable objects for display  then determining other allowed actions per item  while iterating  i ran into this using a fairly plain rails_admin setup   swobspace yup  1 6 7 works  could be something that changed around the truthiness sql   't' 't'   i just use  true  in my workaround    hmm   
it was my fault  i use it with active admin and didn't do some things right  thank you 
for sdl2 on the pi  x11 support is virtually nonexistent  sdl2 uses the gpu directly on that platform 
this happens with and without endoom enabled  this is the stable 2 0 0 build  but bug also seems to be present in 2 0 0 beta3 and latest windows devbuilds 
i decided to try 32 bit and full screen  i just re downloaded the zip to try again 1  unzip to a folder called "c  chocolate doom  new " 2  copy over said  same as above  files 3  launched chocolate doom setup keeping stuff default  includes the display at 32 bit  full screen  640x480 4  set multiplayer name  usually friend and i use this for multiplayer too as it allows for private games   5  setup crashes  6  setup starts itself again  then tried it again     1  did steps 1 3  and skipped 4  same as above  2  use warp feature 3  upon starting  game crashes and restarts setup  then decided to just make a shortcut to "chocolate doom" with the command line " iwad doom wad"  that worked  but it still takes longer to start up than 2 0 0  hope this helps getting the setup program sorted out  i tend to use it more than chocolate doom's own exe to select game  and like i said  friend and i use it for multiplayer too 
win 8
it's going to differ depending on the driver  it looks like  for example  it seems like for opl the place to hook into would be the end of the opl3_generate function  https   github com chocolate doom chocolate doom blob 30f853b65820280931e06e07fd5f624313670305 opl opl3 c#l1090 but then you have to do that for each individual driver  however  i found a workflow to get what i want  1  convert to midi using wildmidi 1  use a command line tool called adlmidi  https   github com wohlstand adlmidi  to convert that midi file into a wav  adlmidi understands how to use the genmidi lump  and even has both the doom 1 and doom 2 versions built in  plus its opl3 emulation uses the nuked library  the same one used by chocolate doom  the only reason i wasn't using it before is that adlmidi's mus parsing totally screws up the tempo  but it can handle regular midi just fine  i hesitated to use wildmidi at first  due to me misunderstanding that the mus2mid library is not flawed  apparently the mid2mus utility is the flawed one  i tried a few files and the output sounds nearly identical to chocolate  now to try to find a midi player that understands dmxgus lumps   
 fragglet  i don't experience the problem described in #331  i'm using i3 myself as my main window manager and chocolate doom behaves just fine  it only scales the game when i manually resize the i3 window under which the game is running  since the issue was closed and never fixed  i take it that #331 must have been an issue with i3 or the compositor used and not with chocolate doom itself  this is a different issue  it is a request for some sort of option under which the game will not scale its window automatically when the user resizes the container window 
yep  those are the packs i am using  i re downloaded them as well to ensure i had the latest versions  all tracks do not loop properly  here are 2 examples  doom e1m1   d_e1m1 flac doom e1m6   d_e1m6 flac
hmm   on my antergos computer updated today  i don't get the issue in gnome in either wayland or xorg  gnome 3 32 2   but it is chocolate doom setup 3 0 0  i still get the issue with the computer in the original issue with 2 3 0 even in x org mode

thanks mark for noting that  so initially when i made the input file there were a number of species which were tagged as duplicates  however  upon subsequent corrections tagged as  duplicate species errors   the input file passed and model generation begun  nonetheless  i'm tempted to say that you're right since the thermolibrary already has this specie i think removing it from the actual input file might actually make it work  let me try that and see what happens  thanks for the feedback 
http   jsfiddle net gtdud 1  if you type 'c' into the first row and go to the next  the 'c' isn't displayed  even though the data is saved  when you make the first row editable again  the 'c' is correctly displayed in the input  and when you leave it  the 'c' is displayed correctly 
thanks for the detailed response tin    i couldn't agree more  i have worked with grids with poor performance and as you say yes opening up additional features may impact the overall performance  i will definitely consider this solution  i will update you once i have tried it out  feel free to close the ticket considering async rendering as a valid work around  you are the best judge on the subject   i have just one fundamental concern   the way the async renderer is implemented is by firing settimeout operations   if i am talking about a serious editable grid simulation using this technique i could have an explosion of settimeout that could hang browsers till the events are fired  to back what i say  http   stackoverflow com questions 5340142 is having too many settimeouts good   thoughts welcome    thanks again 
go to the simple example  http   mleibman github com slickgrid examples example1 simple html increase the size of the column "duration" by dragging the right edge of its header until the column "  complete" is hidden  the horizontal scrollbar should appear now  but it doesn't  i got the same result in firefox  ie and chrome 
i move "function applycolumnwiths" set style left to "function appendrowhtml stringarray  row " stringarray push " div class '" + cellcss + "' style 'left "+x+"px' "   x +  m width  test ie8 is ok
possibly but it happened since the first time i loaded the page  it never has worked for me  also there is an error in the console and the response from the url that is requested is a full web page which i wouldn't have thought is the response that the script would be expecting  http   digg com  query apple offset 0 count 50 appkey http   slickgrid googlecode com type javascript callback c is the request it makes 
yeah  does appear to be related to zoom  100  works fine  90  locks up 
if i pass "dataset" into the data for slickgrid    it will not render correctly and sorting will not work because "dataset" doesn't have the right keys needed  the keys that slickgrid is trying to references are actually inside "dataset data" 
i haven't received any errors  and remember having successfully tested the example before any modifications  i just noticed that only the first row starts as selected and will stay highlighted as long as the text matches  no other rows disappear or are highlighted when their text matches 
the issue happen in our code  not in slickgrid library  so i close this

thank you  kaiweichang for your anwer  please find below my whole class  to make the code more clear  and not make ref outside of the class   i just forced the correct answer for pos tag    4 which is punctuation  results are of course the same than the one described in my previous message   btw caching examples in a dict increase the rapidity of the model learning and should be included in the python examples    it is even more important for cost sensitive learning where generating all possible tags takes a lots of times

from what i understand  there are different ways of dealing with continuous action  i'm not sure which one is being worked on currently  what i think would be helpful is  1  how do we deal with continuous action space  do we discretize the action space or parameterize it by assuming some continuous distribution like gaussian  2  if we discretize it  how do we deal with the discretization error  do we use the zooming approach by assuming lipschitz  also  what is the recommended exploration method here  3  if we use continuous distribution  how does the model learn and explore  is it similar to one step policy gradient

the efficiency of  company auto complete  already comes from the fact that one no longer needs something like  ret  to insert the selected candidate  but instantly choosing the first candidate just because it happened to be first is irritating and simply wrong  it's pure usability problem here  in other words  with the combination of settings in my first post  basically  company  becomes unusable  we would have to fix that anyway   given the framework that you already have  it shouldn't be that much coding to support this option  in any case  thank you for your efforts  dmitry  this is a great package

i do it by  m x   customize variable      company clang executable  and enter   usr bin clang 3 5  in the text box and click  save and apply   emacs version    gnu emacs 25 1 50 2  i686 pc linux gnu  gtk+ version 3 10 8  of 2016 04 25  installing package clang gives clang version 3 4 and installing clang 3 5 installs the clang version 3 5 
i do not know how to reproduce from scratch  i tried  the traces are different  it does not call  company calculate candidates  
i'll do that  thanks 
 dgutov unfortunately  it doesn't work  i will check your codes to see if i can find the reason   where i turned off  company dabbrev code everywhere    img width "643" alt "screen shot 2017 09 27 at 18 36 01" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 5046605 30925987 fd2ca040 a3b3 11e7 9e83 a31da31c5f6b png"   img width "629" alt "screen shot 2017 09 27 at 18 35 37" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 5046605 30925992 00eec550 a3b4 11e7 9c00 408bcdce3f2a png" 
heya  nikital i'm not using the yas backend either  so it's good that  dgutov brought it up because it would've completely slipped my mind  putting aside yas for a second  i think that  1  is the most reasonably consistent behaviour where you don't have to do the mental shift from "tab completes" to "i'm in a template now  tab does another thing"  i like templates and miss them when moving fomr go to rust so i wouldn't be much in favour of 4  as for inside yas  probably a best effort approach is good enough  just let the tng users know that tab clashes with yas snippet and recommend they bind it to a different keybinding  in the tng docstring  i agree that having company rebind yas' tab would be too invasive    c j might not be the best recommendation because iirc some major modes use this for things  maybe have the docstring recommend they unbind m n m p from company candidate selection and use that for yas 
i am not sure why  but when i add  company drabbev code  again it is working   so now i dont know why it was not working from the beginning  sorry 
   #  international ispell version 3 1 20  but really aspell 0 60 6 1  
it is not working like tab in ycm   1  i am typing   2  completion menu pops up   3  i press tab  mb several times    4  a completion item is selected in the popup  i can see it in my line  but the completing part of the item is right from the cursor    if i continue typing the completing part disappears    here i expect to continue typing after the completing part of the word  i e  completing part is preserved after pressing tab  like in ycm  
this is what i see    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 12972892 50512821 f22e7500 0ab5 11e9 8be0 510af906efcc png    ideally the  retry  completion should come after  return  completion  it was working fine before recent releases    company diag 
wow  that indeed does fix the issue and i now get names along w  keys in the company popup in shell  thank you very much for the quick reply and simple solution  what's different given company was using the company yasnippet backend w o the grouping parens in the first place

this would be nice to have for user feedback  if a user queues a high priority task  that you obviously want to handle asynchronously  you can instantly provide the user with job progress  i was thinking of something like 
the immediate fix is to vendor the library  but  i think the correct fix is to change the gem dependency from "json" to "json_pure " if "json" is found  that lib will be used automatically anyway  so  the only risk is someone that installs resque but doesn't use "json" or "json jruby" anywhere else ends up with slower json processing  otherwise  there's no way to activate the gem in jruby

no  actually i meant  using resque with unicorn  i'm deploying my app that uses resque  and it kept killing my process after 30s  i'm starting to wonder what the issue is  and i saw some posts saying it could be the connectiont to redis that is causing errors  and since resque uses redis  i'm wondering if that is the problem  so that's why i ask if they give an example of what people who use unicorn to deploy how to deply with unicorn  on mon  nov 12  2012 at 2 02 pm  steve klabnik notifications github comwrote

looks like this was fixed by https   github com resque resque commit 59a7d6190152b073c8fbecdfab1af54264a2ae1c but this change was never released  i think all we need is a new release

i think this was fixed  or i misinterpreted the results i was getting due to other server related issues at the time  i'm not experiencing the issue anymore

i think most of the getting started problems were around dependencies  postgres  correct ruby  redis  etc    checking for installing dependencies with script setup would probably limit the setup system to macs  for a while at least   vagrant may allow it to be more universal  i have to run through the whole process again from a bare install to remember all of the components 
 envygeeks  my chrome version is  24 0 1312 57 i saw several people talking about this issue in #rubygems aws on irc yesterday   today so i assumed it was proabably more than just myself  but i could be wrong  i've definitely done hard refreshes  purged cache  etc  on my end  but i'd love to be wrong 
i was using jeweler  and i must have deleted the version string by accident  i could not tell you how it broke ruby  i was forced to install a rvm gui to switch into a different version of ruby and delete the version i was working in to get anything to work  once everything that was related to the gem was removed  i was abel to resume working  on sun  apr 13  2014 at 5 20 pm  andré arko notifications github comwrote 
i don't remember installing it  just rubygems   i'm assuming it came with macos 
i would personally appreciate efforts on keeping all data normalized  yeah   +1  in this particular case  we might want to yank the gems where this problem is detected  since the gems were not actually installable anyways 
yes  gevent raises timeout  which is not derived from exception  the code i'm suggesting changing back to bare  except   re raises the exception  so it shouldn't swallow keyboardinterrupts  and i think having it not catch keyboardinterrupt is buggy too    if a keyboardinterrupt were raised at the wrong moment  it could cause a connection to get returned to the pool in an inconsistent state too 
i am not set encoding when call redis strictredis  the file encoding is utf 8   getrecordcount make exception only the first call  the second call is no problem  it's very strange  wish you can help me 
ah yes my mistake  the command should be  docker run  p 6379 6379   name some redis  d redis  thanks 
sorry   import sys import time import os from redis import strictredis host   os environ "redis_host"  redis   strictredis host host  port 6379  pubsub   redis pubsub   pubsub psubscribe '__key __  '  print 'starting message loop'  while true  message   pubsub get_message   print message "data"   that is the full of my code block   when i run this code 2 3 days at production server   when send a message from redis publisher i've no response from any consumers  this code block is consumer's

when geocoding returns no results  my geocoded_by block never gets called  i put a debugger inside the method to check  and when i enter 'asdf' as an address for instance  the method is never invoked and the results array is not created  is this the expected behavior or am i do something wrong 
i _have_ to pass it to near and nearbys  so instead of having a number repeated everywhere  or defining a global constant and passing that   it would be clean to have it as a configuration option  maybe my case is a super edge case and not worth pursuing for geocoder  i just wanted to bring it up in case other people would find it useful as well  thanks for responding and feel free to close the ticket however you want  i appreciate your work on this  cheers  will cole on monday  august 13  2012  alex reisner wrote

thanks for the quick answer  there are some things in  geocoder  that my directions code would be needing anyway   like passing the api key   google premier keys  caching or handling errors in a unified way  cause they're pretty much the same errors like for all other google lookups   putting this in a separate gem would mean doing these things twice and possibly in a different way  forking would make updates difficult   so i'll probably stick to my monkey patch extension thingy  monkey  opening up  geocoder  lookup street_services   actually helps with that  and apart from that i was keen to share my code    btw directions comes with a pretty cool feature  if you pass coordinates  the response will contain reverse geocoded addresses  and if you pass address strings  the response will contain their coordinates   so if you need both geocoding   reverse geocoding and directions you can skip using the geocoding api and take the results from your directions call 
thanks alexreisner i have found "api error over limit" error issue sometimes  it's dependent on  per hour  per day  etc   thanks
hi  alexreisner  i have got some local proxy issues  that was the issue  i have configured the proxy settings and after that it got worked  so closing this  cheers man 
that does indeed fix it  thanks  is doing it this way the best solution though  it does seem like it'll end up getting called twice in an actual rails app with this  once in 1fc56aca2a4806a2242f772ff350a8f5bc682c28  and once by the   initializer   https   github com alexreisner geocoder blob 1fc56aca2a4806a2242f772ff350a8f5bc682c28 lib geocoder railtie rb#l7 l10   doesn't seem like a huge deal since it won't result in any different results  but it does seem a bit odd  i _think_ the only situation where you need the explicit call  insert  is when rails is stubbed  so maybe calling it in the  test_helper rb  would be a bit cleaner 
no i don't think so because i got the same problem when i try the example from the project site 
thanks for the quick responses  +1  the main thing i want to do is be able to pull out  429  responses so we can slow down our requests  having access to others would be nice too  so we can print out nice error messages and debug  we're going to be handling 10k+ coordinate requests at a time  so pretty important to us that we can debug more easily if there's a problem
yeah it seems that  right_aws  gem requires it  funny thing is that it's triggered when i call  make_api_request  method from geocoder  anyway  looks like it's not relevant and we can close it

 alexreisner well    it only helps in terms of providing exactly what i'm looking for in pretty much exactly the way i was hoping to be able to implement it  🙂 honestly  i've looked at that part of the readme several times in the past  no idea how i missed it this time  maybe the  reverse_geocode_by  example threw me off and i skimmed past it  in any case  thanks 
using  freegeoi    do you know which ones provide  state_code  
ok  thanks for that clarification on how it works  here is the output of that command 
 alexreisner thanks for your response i will check rgeo gem  but this issue what am facing is i have a city or county coordinates and if user enters any address which has its own coordinates and i should validate that user coordinates are with in the limit of the city or country specified  i need this kind of verification of the coordinates of address which user enter 
yes  i am sharing a snippet migration file of  address rb   which i use to store the geo specific data 
even when i upgraded to premium access to the link that i posted  i can't find anywhere in geocoder gem to put my credentials 
that works

error was generated when attempting to access the burn down chart from the master backlog page  what steps should i take to verify that patches have been applied 
i'm using subject  sprint name  story subject  hours estimated  description  i'm sure that subject and description caused that error  simple lines can do that as well   i noticed a problem with rectangles but i've to investigate it further someday however  it will be a entirely different issue  
many thanks for your quick answer   we are using redmine with backlogs     and we are trying to make some integrations with some external reports we have developed   the point is that we need the value of story_points field  the one created by backlogs in the issues table   but for some reason via rest api redmine do not export the field   don't worry  i'll ask redmine developers just to see if something can be configured    regards 
yeah  thanks  i'm referring to the description section 
yes  of course  i use "thin" server  i run "service thin stop"  check that thin process disappears from processlist  then do all updates  and finally run "service thin start" 
can do  its a production system so i was trying to stick to the tags  but if its still relatively close to v0 7 7 i suppose i've nothing to lose  d great improvements lately  love the task board 
sorry  i hadn't realized that _that_ was the subject 
sorry  for the lack of answer  it's not working  the backlog doesn't have the drag drop function neither the edit in place 
i would like to test it first if that's not a problem 
setup  ubuntu 10 04 64 bits apache2 2 2 14 5ubuntu8 10   gem list  grep passenger passenger  3 0 12  3 0 11  not using requestheader x_forwarded_proto   were we supposed to  host name and path  dev our_domain com protocol  https
you're right  i tried that too and it does work  so i guess it doesn't have to do with rails 3 2 12  i'm running against redmine master  so probably it's just something that's different there against 2 2 stable  thanks  ricardo
sure  thank you  i'll let you know as soon as i try 
yes  i do  i am the redmine administrator  so i should be allowed to change anything  also  when i click on the issue number to open the issue in a separate window  i can change the state of the task to progress  which in turn will then be updated on the task board after a short amount of time 
i mean go from last to first without going in reverse  take a look at the new carousel i installed  www partreports com it works exactly like i want  i replaced all your code with this one 
http   www el w co uk test 
admittedly  i'm doing some pretty funky things to these carousels  for example  the client wanted the carousels to start on the last item  and then scroll through all of the items to the first upon page load  it's very possible that i've mucked something up along the way  i can't link it directly  as we're still on a local dev server  but i extracted the jcarousel portions of the page and the problem seems to persist  you can grab it  here  http   www pmcmonagle ca public jcarousel_issue 198 zip  
here is example what i am trying to say  suppose i have configured carousel to scroll 3 slides at a time and on click say slide s7  s8  s9 comes to visible area so "itemvisiblein jcarousel" should fired for all s7  s8 and s9  this event fires three time but gives reference of s7 only    "   "  on "itemvisiblein jcarousel"  "li"  function     console log this     this prints s7 three time in this case but should print s7  s8 and s9      and same is happening for itemvisibleout jcarousel  it works fine after code changes as per comment 1
apologies for the delay in replying  as soon as i changed the container width from 94em to 940px the gap disappears  i want to keep on using ems   i'll change the design so that it's not so reliant on being pixel perfect  thanks again for your advice 
thanks jsor for your answer but i'm sorry  i don't understand what you mean    could you please be more explicit  thanks in advance
yes i was referring to center feature in  3  the only time i've noticed it not working correctly is with images in web kit  its because until you check if the image is loaded the width height will return a 0  the link i posted above explains what i'm talking about a little clearer

i appreciate the quick response  unfortunately  that does not fix the issue and now the carousel is not "clipped"  i can see the newly inserted item on the left before it scrolls into view and the portion of the right most item that should be scrolled out of view  http   jsfiddle net rcollette fr2gn 16 
hi jan thanx for getting back to me  ill explain it better as well as set up a jsfiddle attached is a screen shot of my site  i set up a carousel for my portfolio  i want to have several pages  covers  spreads  single pages and websites  all have the carousel my question is when i click on the nav bar on the left side to go to another page  say spreads  can i set up the same exact carousel for the other following pages  i did and nothing on the page was showing up  meaning can i have multiple pages with the same script i hope that makes sense on nov 16  2013  at 1 48 pm  jan sorgalla wrote  scott w  valenzano http   www swvmediadesign com  http   www creativehotlist com svalenzano
this was it  i just figured it out on my own a minute ago and i came here to post  i have been searching for a solution the whole day  thank you for your time   
code is massive  you can see here   http   bit ly 1umvluw you can see mostly when you try with different ie versions

no  sorry i can't  system is current win7 with moz ff 25 0 1  the problem is    eg   for the paste button  that the de file has  and replaced all other occurences of unicode entities to real umlauts  that fixed the problem of display

it appears both update and upgrade work and have the same effect  this is most likely to avoid confusion with aptitudes update upgrade   oops  accidentally closed the issue 
maybe this is a different error  but i tried it again on fresh install  latest webmin  ubuntu server 15 04 i changed only these settings   and even if i access to webmin miniserverer url with edited settings   http   192 168 56 50 10000 webmin   without proxy  page appear without css style there are no 404 for css  picture attached http   s30 postimg org oa6vx5y75 snapshot2 png

after more investigation i've found that there will be one status 200 code   but it is one of the segments and it is not size of the whole file   i am pretty sure that the 206 must be counted   right now we have edited those perl files and everything works fine but i hate of hacking every time and after each update of virtualmin   apache access log
 qooob  jcameron we have already implemented the solution you are suggesting   mvarian has made a pull request https   github com qooob authentic theme pull 520  between both of us   mvarian    maanas  were split on choice of option if you see from a theme perspective  it is a good solution  if you see from a perl perspective  it is more intuitive to add the class right in the ui_submit which can be used across the theme  both of you guys are doing awesome work  and we though we bounce this here and let pros take a call 
here's a virtualhost section  copied from the file in   etc apache2 sites enabled   this is a debian 8 server which recently received a  dist upgrade  from debian 7 which it had been running for some time  apache is pretty much working now  current issues  probably will be cleared up when all the other   conf  files  virtualhost  are cleaned up  1  although  systemd  complains that  apache2  isn't starting within 30 seconds   apache2  clearly starts up  2  also  systemd  thinks it stops  apache2  almost immediately  yet it doesn't  so you have to run the  kill  command  to get  apache2  working  1  removed a line referring to a php handler  can't remember exactly which line  but it's the classic one which prevents  apache2  from changing user so that it can run scripts as the owner of the directory  2  went into "webmin  servers  apache  modules" and disable  php5    cgi   and  cgid   other issues  1  running multiple versions of php on the server  virtualmin does well as it detects them in   opt rh    however  when recently the additional php versions were updated  7 0 was added  5 5 was added and 5 6 was removed because the debian 8 operating system now supplies 5 6 natively  this causes the links to change  add new links  and remove old links  the  mydomain com conf  file fails to get updated by virtualmin   the lines of interest are   addhandler    fcgiwrapper    addtype  and  removehandler   for example  recently 7 0 was added  and 5 6 was removed  these lines are all interconnected and webmin virtualmin should either update them  or should notify the admin to do so  because some severe consequences can occur in unexplained hanging behavior of apache2  with no errors in logs to alert you  1  it'd be nice to add some automatic support for web acceleration technology such as google  mod_pagespeed  apache module  plus running apache behind a high speed caching  http  reverse proxy such as varnish 5 0  and a high speed  https  reverse proxy such as  nginx   to make this work  you should add the directive  modpagespeedrespectxforwardedproto on  to all of the proxied virtual hosts 
i use webmin 1 801 with authentic theme 18 02  exactly same when i do not have the issue  maybe i change something without realizing it   here screenshot from file manager  http   img4 hostingpics net pics 387703capture jpg in red you can see webmin did not show all files
if the external ip address is specified while creating the virtual server  can it show this ip address 
i am on ubuntu 16 04 2 server edition and i have nsec records all packets upgraded 
 jcameron directly  not through webmin  so what is the best way to trigger the update   service webmin restart   
that's the reason i provided a screenshot in my original post    apt get autoremove  y   apt get autoclean  in that line  the g  y  ' ' are cropped at the bottom  no big deal again  except that on an azerty keyboard the ' ' and ' ' keys are next to each other  so you never know it you typed wrong or if it's just the padding  also  once there are several lines  this effect disappears  it's juts the padding on a single line that is not high enough  and only since the font has changed in 1 930  the problem did not occur with the default 'monospace' font in previous versions 
 jcameron this is all doable by using inbuilt arguments for netstat but  ideally it would be useful to have  a user changeable refresh rate  as there are so many arguments available  it would be good if users could have the option to add extra arguments with in the module  also  connection type and process name and pid  thanks
latest firefox  64bit   windows 8 1  64bit  52 9 0 firefox  64bit   linux  debian testing   64bit  tested with internet explorer as well  none of them redirect properly  they simply get endless page loading and then "cannot connect to server" what do you mean its hacking with the ssl protocol  could you not just serve a standard page on http  that tells the browser to redirect to https 
no effect     passhostheader   false true  edit  i remember that in the past i added  sockets 127 0 0 1  into miniserv conf   tried removing it and test all combination so far and same behavior

sorry for the delay  yes i get the same error message when using the full version  additionally  when i installed it again  it had kept all my previous settings  i changed theme   this was because i didn't delete the previous files folder from the first "failed" uninstall  as  swelljoe said  the systemd issue is separate  it will be because i previously ticked the "start at boot time" option 
this is virtualmin  not webmin  lucas on sat  aug 24  2019  03 31 art lucas  notifications github com  wrote 
no  i didn't do anything  it stopped working not sure why     maybe an upgrade  then i removed re installed webmin  still  i cannot get it running with ssl 
a restart of server seemed to fix the problem    
i ended up just creating a custom  statementlocator  using a simple  map  of sql scripts that i load from various folders and using  handlebars  https   github com jknack handlebars java   for more portable   variable   syntax  as the templating engine  i made this switch a while ago  but happened to find the bug during testing and thought i would point it out  the   bindin  annotation also assumes colons are used and thus suffers from the same problem  i think the broader ideal solution would be to make the colon parser  or another colon parser variant  able to just detect and ignore double colons and thus avoid the need to use the hash as a prefix in the first place colons seem to be an unofficial standard for variable binding in multiple libraries across multiple languages and some users may desire to use sql templates across codebases 
 qualidafial sometimes i open my mouth and insert my foot in such a fine fashion that i even impress myself  so we are using dropwizard  so that puts us at version 2 63 1  so actually before the merge of the columnmappers  point two is we are using customer mappers instead of the bean mapper or reflection mapper  so this check is actually on us  as i have been reading through the code though i think we might look into doing something where we can do a reflection type of mapping and then have a post method to handle mapping any fields that don't match up by name  anyways  please ignore my issues  and sorry for wasting your time  thanks jeff
 qualidafial   stevenschlansker i am from china my english is not goods  i used jdbi3  when db fields naming suffix with digital  such as 'user_name_2' my pojo named as 'username2'  the jdbi camel converter doesn't work  but the method with me  can work well 
hi  arteam   the problem is  interface  of java can't support concrete implementation inside the method so your codes may throw compile error 
hello matthew  thanks for response  i think that is not what i am looking for  i'll try to explain to you with another example  for instance  if we have function in postgresql   how can i call  test_function  from the example above 
the design of the project i am working with is made in a certain mode and i can't change it  recently i started to integrate the project with it's structure with jdbi and from some reasons i have to register a row mapper at run time when it's necessary and i have to do something like this   jdbi jdbishandle   handle getjdbi       this is what i want jdbishandle registerrowmapper beanmapper factory mybeanclass   but i can't access the jdbi instance where the execution point is at that time  that's why i need the jdbi instance from handle instance

 stevenschlansker yep  there's an unfortunately necessary part of a nightly task that iterates over hundreds of thousands of ids from one db to see if they've been acted on in a different db   qualidafial thanks for a quick alternative 
awesome  i'll test the fix to confirm

it is useful in unittests  e g  start ioloop  send some messages  stop ioloop  verify desired states were reached  the tornado ioloop support this for example  see the documentation of the stop   function  1    1  http   www tornadoweb org en stable ioloop html

 vitaly krugl   i thought that simply putting into  queue_declare     would be enough  and note it in the changelog  however  given that it applies to more method with  nowait  and a  callback   maybe  _validate_channel_and_callback    should be extended with above condition and taking  nowait false  as default  then modifying callers as appropriate 
version 0 10 0  and you're quite right about the time sleep   it was just a quick way of triggering the problem with the example code    our own code uses timeouts and exhibits the same behaviour  the pika exceptions incompatibleprotocolerror is being raised when rabbitmq is back up again 
 vitaly krugl   yes  my app is multi threaded  two threads  one thread is used to push messages into a queue  the other is used to receive messages from another queue  from the beginning  i used only one connection for both threads  later  i changed my app to use different connections respectively  but no matter which pattern  i still get above errors  what should i do next  i'm stuck here now 
can i email you instead of posting the code here  the code may be unusable without the publisher code  but most errors have occurred overnight when there is no activity on any of the channels  so it might be worthwhile just running the receiver and seeing what happens 
part of the problem is that the problem only rears its head quite rarely  as in when i try to ingest and process a large number of files  e g  100 000 tweets  very quickly  up to 30 files a second  the code i'm using can be found at on the spotlight data github repo  here  https   github com spotlightdata nanowire plugin py

sure   although it has to be an integration test  given its nature   a jar file would have to be created  containing the two following files dirs  meta inf services org junit runner notification runlistener mytool integration junit myrunlistener class the first is a text file with a single line  containing the name of runlistener implementation class  "mytool integration junit myrunlistener"  without the quotes   the second is an arbitrary runlistener subclass  once you have this jar  the following junit test could be executed  with that jar in the classpath   in the particular case of jmockit  the jar containing the service would be jmockit jar  and the runlistener implementation would be "mockit integration junit4 initializer"  i just implemented this in my environment and it works well  i edited a copy of the runnotifier class and put it in the classpath before junit 4 8 1 jar   i ran my tests under the sun jdk 1 6 0_18 and under jdk 1 5 0_19  also  i didn't notice any reduction in the total test run execution time 
hm    apparently m2eclipse  the tool i looked with got it wrong  anyways  the sources are there  i'll allow myself to close the ticket     
there is a junit bundle from servicemix  it think it would be better if this was not necessary though

say you have this strocture  public abstract foo extends otherfoo     when running a junit test on the entire class sunoffoo then dosomething is not ignored    
now i've tried  it runs perfectly  it seems it is a problem of surefie and eclipse  this thought had crossed my mind before but i thought this to be very unlikely  it looks like the line feed character  0ax  caused the problem   at least in eclipse  why in maven surefire the complete vm goes down  i don't know  so  thank you  looks you did everything right    
thank you  that fixed it  i was importing org junit    but that clearly didn't work  any ideas why 
yes  thanks 
what does the headline say  and where does the links point to 
thanks for your help  yes  that works  moving  before to starting and  after to finished did the job  not super intuitive though 
thanks 
sorry i did not see the whole failure trace it did work

 tibor17 yes initializing every test method was intended and was also done before i switched to rules  i did not have any static members whatsoever  unfortunately i am not at liberty to post the original code  i will try to isolate a piece that can reproduce the error and share it with you later today  also i should note that i am using rulechain along with the rules
 marcphilipp the problem is that we are trying to run junit tests in parrallel and inside the test execute a test based on a url  that url needs to have a different port for each test  this will not work with system properties because there is no mapping for different ports to each test unless we can somehow pass in a way to read a different property port1  port2     do you know any other way to try to do this

 trentmwillis sure  for me it does not make sense  because for a test to have a  runtime   it should get the chance to  execute   to run some instructions  but skipped tests are simply skipped  neither the hooks are executed for them  for example mocha's emitted objects for skipped tests do not have the runtime  actually it is called duration for mocha  property at all   leobalter  sure js reporters can easily ignore the value  we are currently doing this in  fix qunit adapter #58  https   github com js reporters js reporters pull 58   anyway  to ensure the runtime is 0  sounds fair  smiley

i was running from the download  i'll try the latest source 
after some googling for the term ttb  i think we use a similar structure  a main branch trunk  a dev directory for development branches  and a release subdirectory that contains branches for versions we have released  or are about to release  the project is still developed quite heavily  but there are also released versions  and i find it hard in tfs to see which commit is for which branche  and what changes were pulled in by a merge 
hello  sorry i could not respond sooner  the output to that command is like the below   to give a little more context on what my attempt was  i'd like to use git tfs in an attempt to push pull changes to from different tfs repos  is this possible  taking the concept of 'forking' i'd like to fork a tfs project  make changes to the fork  maintain a special branch in the fork for changes that i want to push back to the original repository  and then push all the other changes up into the forks tfs repo as well  do you think this is possible 
ha  thank you  it took 16 minutes for 238 files  158 folders 183 kb  those are git objects  actual source is 52 files  7 folders 206 kb  and my "git log   pretty online" gives 16 lines  i know response of our tfs is not so great  so i really can't attribute all 16 minutes to git tfs clone  anyway  d option gives a hint that something is going on  also as all initial work is about creating objects within  git folder i couldn't find any update in working folder but i could see objects getting added in  git folder
i think i caused additional confusion when trying to debug this issue  i tried  git tfs pull  and  git tfs rcheckin  several times and caused a crazy amount of additional git commits it seems  none of which have a null commit string though  there is one commit that i suspect where i reference  git tfs id  because i query tfs to post the changes to interested users and if that token is used perhaps it's breaking something  just a naive guess without looking at any code 
i have git installed on my machine  here is what i had to do 1  run the build libgit2sharp cmd to build the libgit project  2  compile the git tfs solution in release mode  that did the trick  thanks for the help sc68cal   
yes the file exists and has a size of 222mb  looks like it is a valid zip file 
sorry for taking so long to answer   i only have access to the git repository at work  regarding my situation  i've rechecked the logs and it seems i misread them a bit  file a didn't get deleted  but instead got renamed as file c  which still exists in both git and tfs repositories  basically  what happened is that file b got renamed as a and the original file a got renamed as c  after this particular changeset files a and b don't appear in the repository anymore  sent to  dev null   only file c is there  hope this helps 
will do when i have some breathing time this weekend  i'll put some logging and see what transpires 
i have runned it with debug option before but didn't kept the log  now i can't reproduce it  either it was caused by corrupted package on chocolatey  now i installed git from official web site   or it was because of large amount commits to checkin   27   don't have time to check it  sorry for disturbing  i think we can close this issue

my goal wasn't to waste time of someone  i'm sorry if it's the case   but just create a reference  not an issue  related to the project goals "tfs as a real git remote" that could be tracked  i redacted my "issue" to more reflect my intension

feature request  i would like a flag  showarrow  in the options object passed to actions  this would do the same thing that the similarly named flag in showprompt does  it would be nice if changing away from the default prompt position didn't cause the arrow that is pointing towards an erroneous field entry to go away  e g  when you specify no promptposition you get the prompt above the field with an arrow pointing at the field  however  once you change the position to let say centerright  you lose the arrow pointing towards the field  arrow  jquery '#adminform'  validationengine 'init'   no arrow  jquery '#adminform'  validationengine 'init'  promptposition   "centerright"  scroll  false    apologies if i have missed the option that allows this  i see it for showprompt but none of the action options 
well  the ideas are 1  made "centerright" can work in overflown divs  2  compensate margins and or paddings   may be in the others positions this isn't problem but in a center the prompt could overwrite the field  for example  after read your comment i test the above code again and fix some issues  pre  case "centerright"  var fixpospad   methods _addproperties field css "padding right"  field css "padding left"  +5  if  overflow    var fixpostop   methods _addproperties field css "margin top"    prompttopposition   promptheight + fixpostop  fixpospad +  methods _addproperties field css "margin left"       promptleftposition+  fieldwidth + fixpospad  break    pre  and try but ins't shorter  i know  however  it fullfil the 2 upper ideas  may be the main complication for me was avoid problems with parseint parsefloat or properties with value of "auto"  i e   mainly in ie  because all that  i wrote the function  may be this function could be simplest using jquery  i don't know

i’m pretty sure this will _not_ be seen as bug by r core  it’s documented and intentional  while _i_  and we  see it as a bug misfeature  i see no chance of the default behaviour being changed in r base  so the only chance of having a widely used sensible and consistent datetime to date function would be having such a function in the lubridate package   of course  this is not a _required_ function  as it’s easy to work around  but it would be very helpful having it as a _convenience_ function  i like convenience functions  ☺

hi  my approach to check the user privileges depends on 3 levels  folder controller method   when the user is logged in  the system loads user's privileges from the db  after that  in each request i check if the user has access to the current method in the current controller in the current folder  the check is made inside  code my_controller  code  while all my controllers extends  code my_controller  code  and  code my_controller  code  extends  code rest_controller  code  so  suppose the user requested  code http   domain com master users index  code  that maps to  code userscontroller  code  and the action is  code index_get    code  when he posts a new users to  code http   domain com master users index  code  that will maps to  code index_post  code   my problem when i check the current action to check the user privileges the code  code  this  router  method  code  for  code index_get    code  and  code index_post  code  will always return  code index  code  and the i cannot determine if the request is post or get  so i hope if i can get the full name of the function like  code index_get    code  or  code index_post    code  thanks again  +1

it is now working for me when i create a new project  i'm really not sure where the glitch is happening but until i have more details we can consider this not a glitch in sinatra  thank you for your help 
yes  i have required haml and set  haml in the app  the template is haml  the exception i see is when i run it with shotgun  d  exception  errno  enoent' at  library ruby gems 1 8 gems tilt 1 1 lib tilt rb 119   no such file or directory    users ramarnat dropbox devel gems snail views layout erb i can push a branch with the haml config if you want to take a look  the project is https   github com ramarnat snail
i'm using rubygems 1 3 5  i had this issue when i cloned from https   github com sinatra sinatra git  installing with 'gem install sinatra' had no issues  also  if i try 'gem build sinatra gemspec' in the files that rubygems downloads  there are no issues  might just be an issue with the file in the repository 
ah  very informative    you should use protection  for better or worse  we have an api which accepts a comma separated list of paths unescaped  each of which must begin with a rooted slash   v2 labels  directory1 child  directory2 child if it is fixable  i think honoring this case in rfc 5234 by default is desirable 
ok  sorry for my delay  i wanted to perform a deeper check  first of all disable  protection does not solve the problem  but it turned out i was wrong  rack protection is not the cause of the problem  it is jruby rack  which is needed when you try to run sinatra with jruby  version 1 6 5   any version greater 1 1 1 will cause the mentioned problem 
thanks again  i am very curious and continue looking into it  regarding event stream connection timeout  here is  reply at stackoverflow  http   stackoverflow com a 8761346 179581  by  kanaka  feel free to close the issue 
it worked  thanks    but sorry for duplicate  closing this issue by myself 
i cannot reproduce it anymore  and my application started working with safari  i tested it multiple times before  restarting the application  and could not get rid of the bug  but now it is gone by itself  sorry for the noise  if it comes back i will try to get the logs  thanks 
yes   no problem 
tried on 1 3 5
and yes   sudo  allows it to install without the error 
chrome 29 0 1547 65  also tried with firefox 21 0  had two buddies try from different locations  using chrome and firefox  all with the same result 
thanks for your response   this is my first sinatra project so ask any obvious questions  yes i'm using "enable  sessions"  i'm just creating a small file that reproduces the issue  i thought the session cookie only contained the session id  so i assumed a different length meant it was corrupt  basically i'm putting the username into session  identity   but after these partial audio files are requested  session  identity  is nil    identity is not in the session you decoded as i was logged out at this stage   i will attach a small test script soon  thanks 
 kgrz i don't have tried to install that way  but clone the repo and install it locally works   d thanks 
edit  sorry  it looks like i am in fact setting it and i'd sort of forgotten about that  i'm doing this way 
ruby 2 0 0p645 is used 
 git version 2 13 0  on macos sierra  just tried again  still the same issue 
thanks  that helped  i've opened https   github com rack rack issues 1386
thanks  am on 2 0 7  the following would have worked in 2 0 6 but does not now with 2 0 7   if you execute such a script with sinatra required  main rb swallows all the params 
right now  i'm doing it as username password in the header  so i really just want to be able to set the soap header at the client level  ps  just want to say that it's awesome to have found this library  thanks 
similar to how php handles this  when trace is turned on  a method __getlastrequest and __getlastresponse are available to return the xml strings of each respectively  the idea behind this is when a soapfault error occurs we'd like to be able to submit the call  response  and soapfault response  to the api provider  my hunch  thus far  was to consume stdout and parse for the two strings i'm looking for    but was not sure if anyone else has run into this need    just a question  not a feature request   
yeah right now everything is savon generated  thanks for any help you can give me on that 
the wsdl is located here  http   bedrift telefonkatalogen no tk websvcsendsms php wsdl
sure  i would like to see which attributes the operation requests can have  something like response   client operation  operation  attributes response full     name string required  price decimal   response fields      name   price   so it would be a kind of extension for the client operations i hope you get the picture 
i think aggregating all cookies from all responses would be close to the correct solution  definitely a big improvement  there is probably an edge case where two responses both pass "set cookie" with the same cookie name but different values  in that case only the latest one should be kept  e g  response 1   in that case  we want only "foo baz" 
the configure block i mentioned is in application rb  should i move it to an initializer 
https   gist github com sbu 4712925 the gist contains response to_xml  as you can see the dataexchangeresult field contains an xml  if i parse the xml using multixml then it works   amp amp lt  become  amp lt  and it is correct  look at the field e mail1   as already written  if i use   response to_array  data_exchange_response   data_exchange_result  first   then    amp amp lt    is converted to      
here's the production version of the same wsdl  not sure why that one was down   but it includes import statements  which their development version didn't   i'm pasting the url just because i'l not sure of how you'd want me to provide the wsdl given those imports  http   www transcoreservices com 8000 wsdl tfmifreightmatching wsdl
sorry  i mean "puts" 
it works  thanks  i also tried my test at the latest commit  532f00f291a34748ef9e287148a87a49d734f54e   and it works there too  just fyi  thanks  arun from  trbs  mailto notifications github com  sent  friday  october 04  2013 6 30 am to  django extensions django extensions cc  arun marathe subject  re   django extensions  deprecation warning coming out of the test_dumpscript py file  django extensions version 1 2 2   #385  could you please test this patch   — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com django extensions django extensions issues 385#issuecomment 25689806 
yes  i can confirm this is fixed in the latest commit 
the command is working now  but it's failing to find some packages  example   thanks for your help
great thank you 
makes sense  however  i didn't know that i had to put my imports inside  run    too  i noticed that  the official docs  http   django extensions readthedocs io en latest runscript html  also have imports outside  run     it's not a common coding pattern to do  so it's likely that many others will run into this same problem 
 trbs sure thing  pr   https   github com django extensions django extensions pull 1170
oh so sorry  i had the repo set as a private one in error    oops i changed it to public now  but to answer your question  notebook_arguments    '  ip 0 0 0 0'  '  port 8888'  '  notebook dir  veva' 
sorry about that  yes it is the mac gui i was having the issue with 
i guess so   looks like i have trouble keeping them straight 
that's true  but  which wouldn't change standard behaviour per se   we had this discussion already elsewhere btw       however  i was just thinking to also give a new  additional  class to all "columns" of the data frame to allow method dispatch to work  still  i am puzzled why this happens that way 
yes  i did  and i tried again to be certain   i made that clear now in my original post 
i still get a  ══ terminating early ════  after 10 fails 
i took "ie" to be some strange punctuation around "that is"  thanks for straightening that out  as for the function i have no idea  it cannot be accessed from either asreml or asremlplus via the '   ' operator  not looking good 
sure  i can prepare the pull request  if it gets approved  parameter names in documentation comments are not a php speciality  it can be found in  jsdoc  http   usejsdoc org tags param html     net xml comments  http   msdn microsoft com en us library 8cw818w8 aspx  and others as well 
just my base table model  in fact it's this   http   doc nette org cs quickstart database#toc model
cause i think  that it is very useful   it will be very good and useful part of nette 
so am i  thanks for the fix   
aaaah sorry  this seems to be a php bug https   bugs php net bug php id 63359 edit 1   
it's ok in master  thanks 
sorry  i have no time for this  it's not so simple because it's dependent on used dbms  for example postgresql has separate  column type for time interval  http   www postgresql org docs 9 1 static datatype datetime html  
i thought that all big files are causing memory exhaustion or just own binary files   but i find out it causes files containing null characters 0x00  like file generated from  dev zero  i tried some big files 1gb  like video  file generated from  dev urandom and when i have used function getimagesize     it passed  but didn't returned any mime type and was terribly slow  when i have used fileinfo  i have got right mime type instantly without delay and without memory exhaustion 
sorry  no  i can't i currently don't have any device from which i could do that 
google chrome 45 0 2454 101 firefox 40 0 3 internet explorer 11  windows versions 
so i need to find out if the aec have updated the data behind their search awesome  i didn't realise that  that makes this much easier  hooray for forward thinking  i was planning on making a spreadsheet using the gis map files  but that's harder to automate without infrastructure  because postcode and electoral division overlaps can be anywhere between 1  and 100   you need to set a point at which you decide that a postcode is actually within an electorate and should return that electorate in search results  i'm thinking i'll just run the existing scraper and compare the data with the 2010 data already in the repo and the list i've got based off gis data  then i'll be able to tell if the current aec results are including the new boundaries or not and if the scraper needs any work  one simple question  "does that search include the new boundaries" has turned into a bunch of work haha 😭
yes  in backup rb  i defined it so that i can reuse scp ip path username between multiple backup blocks  i've renamed it to backup_remote_path and it worked  though i was a bit confused for a moment

you are right  it's gpg exitting with 0 but not encrypting anything  i was able to upload an unencrypted archive to dropbox without issues   thanks  
i don't think so  this is a cloud server with 8g ram and 4 cores  which is mostly idling  i will try with the latest changes  and report back my findings    thanks a lot for help  
i'm not sure i can take a look this week either but if i have time i'll try   also  i don't see a way to get the status inside the notifier  i may be blind though    if there isn't a way to get the status from within the notifier block  i'd like to look in to adding that too  i'll create a separate pr issue for it  
ok this is weird  just tested it with 4 2 0  works like a charm  but i am not sure if 4 2 2 didn't work though 
hi tom  i've now made a simple gemfile with just backup in it and done a bundle install and its working ok  thanks  might be worth a note in the docs as the bundle method isn't covered 
it looks to have cleared itself up  i think there was some weird caching going on  if it re occurs i will get you a link 
thanks for your reply  i had fixed this error  realised a small syntax  had to use ' instead of " corrected the below line   fn colorbox  href "http   vimeo com 25634903"  open true    to   fn colorbox  href 'http   vimeo com 25634903'  open true    and it worked fine 
thanks for quick response  this solve the problem  https   github com tbprojects colorbox rails commit d59d4af7c98e0c86ce536b047793da168e2d9225  adding variables on page load 
the following code works  but i am still having some minor issues with it  inside the colorbox folder which i placed into the root folder of the child theme i made the file  colorbox init js with the following code   i modified one of the colorbox css files with the following code  cboxelement   cursor  zoom in  important    #cboxoverlay   background #000      changed from #fff    opacity  0 8  important  filter  alpha opacity   80   important  cursor  zoom out  important  z index  999    #colorbox   outline 0    #cboxclose  position absolute  bottom 0  right 0  display block  color #444  font size  12px  text indent   9999px  padding  100       nb  makes the close button go across the full page  so the zoom out cursor is also seen across the full image     cursor  zoom out    colorbox should now work with images in wordpress 
many thanks for the quick reply  there's really only three selectors in the document  but the error is not really limiting the functionality of the page  it's just a little confusing  so i'll put it online tonight with the current behaviour  will get back to you with the link then  thanks again 
no  unfortunately this does not work  disappointed  i have only a svg element
sure thing    here you go  https   github com mileszs wicked_pdf pull 468
so i had added originally the release candidate of wkhtmltopdf  0 11 0_rc1   i just swapped it out for the wkhtmltopdf heroku gem and it fixed the opacity issue  the executable included in that gem doesn't show the version  but i would assume that is making the difference  it still doesn't pin the blame on either source  but it has luckily fixed the problem 
that solved it  thanks so much 
 unixmonkey that's my controller action https   gist github com maki5 e4aac5a29079eae27c03 and my view https   gist github com maki5 a9963d3057f008380014 the layout  https   gist github com maki5 b4e9c30a814441328637 and the styling  https   gist github com maki5 e0ba5b234a70c8761179 i'm not using any js mvc frameworks  no js involved in pdf rendering  i'm using rails 3 2 14
i also think   wkhtmltopdf  is a better key    exe_path  makes me think of some windows executable   1  i'll see what i can do  but currently  my schedule is crazy  maybe just some better instructions for the readme  i also find confusing the part about assets pipeline  it's not very clear what we have to do to make it works with it 
 unixmonkey unfortunately not  i am using a recent version of wkhtmltopdf  so i don't think that's the culprit  i tried both disabling and not disabling smart shrink  and that didn't work 
no solution  no response  we are moving to a different solution

i actually figured it out by dumb luck  ie8 didn't like the table tag in the  table          form  and needed it with a separate   table  ending tag
hi tony  thanks for link  but i have done debug and noticed that the  t p postdata is never extended with "sopt" object when this condition fails  line  4013  "sdata"   doesn't contain "sopt" object  any tips  best regards 
i have set only one multiselect option to true   here  https   github com tonytomov jqgrid files 250121 index txt  is a simple test case  modified one of your own examples 
jqgrid4 6 and i think maybe there is the same problem in the latest version  e g   cellattr  function rowid  tv  rawobject  cm  rdata    return "id 'xwkcmc" + rowid + "' tmp  'xwkcmc"+rawobject xxx +"'"    i use tmp to data something which inputed by user from page   if user type " i have a freestyle song for u " then gg 
sorry  my statement has a problem  the upstream file used by the  webjars jqgrid  https   github com webjars jqgrid  project is current project  the actual version of the jquery jqgrid min js file in the current project from 4 5 3 to 4 6 0 is 4 5 2  so when jqgrid is introduced through the  webjars jqgrid  https   github com webjars jqgrid  of version 4 5 3 to 4 6 0  and the jquery jqgrid min js file is used  the version 4 5 2 of jquery jqgrid min js is actually used 
i actually figured it out by dumb luck  ie8 didn't like the table tag in the  table          form  and needed it with a separate   table  ending tag

indeed   2 0 0 dev1  does seem to have fixed the issue  once i managed to realise that the  name  parameter is now called  field_name

what your writing is exactly what i'm doing  however  your last comment got me thinking and i did some testing  as it turns out  my override method isn't being found and the application is using the original create action  just to double check  i am overriding by having an invitations_controller rb in my  app controllers  not in a devise sub dir  the code inside this controller is exactly this  class invitationscontroller   devise  invitationscontroller def create super resource roles   params resource_name   roles  if resource errors empty  end end am i missing something 
i bundled version 0 5 4
sorry  i have since removed devise_invitable from my project to get it working  i'll try to replicate it with a new project  you could probably do the same thing in only a few steps  rails new 3 1 project  install devise  install devise_invitable 
not mine      before the update  my invite keys were defined as follows in the devise initializer   where  domain_id is an integer  it's worked quite happily until i tried to bump to the latest version of devise and devise_invitable  i realise the current config defines the invite keys as a hash rather than an array  which i tried  it is me that suggested the multiple keys in the first place   https   github com scambra devise_invitable issues 185   which you kindly sorted out 
migration   let me know if you need any more info  thanks 
no 0
it happens with all new users  not only this one  after i upgrade to 1 3 3  there are no other changes  just "bundle update" with new devise and devise_invitable  if i force it back to 1 3 2 it works fine  irb main  004 0  user find_by_email 'asdm ads asd1'  inspect user load  1 0ms  select "users"    from "users" where "users" "email"   'asdm ads asd1' and  "users" "deleted_at" is null  limit 1    "# user id  4158  email   "asdm ads asd1 "  encrypted_password   " "  reset_password_token  nil  reset_password_sent_at  nil  remember_created_at  nil  sign_in_count  0  current_sign_in_at  nil  last_sign_in_at  nil  current_sign_in_ip  nil  last_sign_in_ip  nil  created_at   "2014 02 07 22 22 16 "  updated_at   "2014 02 07 22 22 17 "  authentication_token   "nyqkojus8zu3easzxszl "  firstname  nil  lastname  nil  team_id  1  properties    favorite_projects       invitation_token   "71ce9fb869f1b555b5011ca8126fbce5264169d3364dcdb0d6a    "  invitation_sent_at   "2014 02 07 22 22 16 "  invitation_accepted_at  nil  invitation_limit  nil  invited_by_id  2  invited_by_type  nil  super_admin  false  project_admin  true  deleted_at  nil  notify  false  clock24  false  avatar  nil  timezone  nil  invitation_created_at   "2014 02 07 22 22 16 "  invitations_count  0 " when i switched back to 1 3 2 it works but "invited_by_type" is also nil  i had a look directly in the database and all the users "invited_by_type" field is empty 
oh  i tried that  in that case the validation of the password fails  then  i am skipping the password as follows   avatar is saved  but it invalidates the token  so  when i try to set the password it fails with "invitation token is invalid"  any ideas how i can skip updating the token with update_attributes  thanks a bunch 
logged all queries in postgres to logfile as below      the token being queried for matches what is in the database on users table for this particular user invitation  still  find_by_invitation_token returns nil almost every time  which i'm checking via an inspect printed to log after the function is called in my invitations controller method resource_from_invitation_token 
hahaha  sorry was looking at too much yesterday and must have put this in the wrong repo  this was an internal thing  sorry for the noise 
i expect  devise_parameter_sanitizer sanitize  invite   to return  but it's returning     
yes same address on other emails  quoting didn't change anything  oddest part is its only the one email that is causing problems  thanks for the quick response 
hey  scambra there go the versions of libraries i have been using
i'm getting for invitations for users who already accepted the invitation  i'm not talking about resending invitations 
sure  there it is  devise  invitable   database_authenticatable   recoverable   rememberable   trackable   validatable 
i'm using https   github com dpslwk wifly
unfortunately i'm not that good in writing whole libraries for myself  i'm not an expert in that  i'm only experienced in looking at examples and rewriting them for my code      i hope someone will pick up the idea and look at those cheap yet powerful  energy efficient 2 4ghz transceivers which are ideal and cheap alternative for zigbee 
 knolleary i updated it through arduino ide  first i had 2 6  but it didnt work so i went through all available versions and then went back up to 2 2  i even tried the 1 x versions  but no luck
i'm trying to connect more than one node esp8266  but with a same topic an payload  how can i identify them based on their chipid's 
hello   knolleary thanks for your help  crossfade doesn't matter  now all my tests including just one line in loop and it is mqttloop    publishing is successful  i'm not sure about rate and size of publishing messages because i'm using  hap nodejs  https   github com adysan hap nodejs  and can't found rate and size defining in its code  but  i'm sure esp got messages because it's blinking everytime i'm publishing  also  publishing can cause reconnection of esp to mqtt  here is a video about that  i didn't catch moment of rare message receiving  because it is really rare  but it still happens from time to time    video on dropbox  https   www dropbox com s lctpylsn7am0dai video mp4 dl 0  
okay  i've isolated it down to a single css style that is making it invisible  the original link image code was nested in a table that put a vertical align top on images  but the following chunk of code  isolated on its own page with no other css styles reproduces the same error  with or without the proper xhtml 1 0 structure surrounding it     a href "test html" id "childpage2"  img src "edit png" style "vertical align  top "     a   vertical align is valid attribute on images as it is the css equivalent of valign   do you know why it is making the image vanish  even though i can see it on the screen  and javascript thinks its visible   i'm assuming the vanishing image is resulting in a link with no content  which might result it not being visible  hopefully you can reproduce now     
jari  my mistake  i was looking at the watir table at http   wiki openqa org display wtr html+elements+supported+by+watir   because it mostly aligns with your api and i wasn't aware of a similar resource specifically for watir webdriver  i was confusing  text with  label  thank you  sorry for crowding your issue queue with misunderstandings on my part 
  correction   last line of that code should be  browser link  href  "http   www theverge com products"  hover after figuring out how to upgrade to 2 26  it seems to work as expected with the drop down menu appearing when the mouse cursor is in the browser window  however  when the mouse cursor is not in the browser  the hover event is still fired  but the drop down menu only appears for a brief second or sometimes not at all 
 p0deje in my application ff and gc are using html5 and ie only using flash upload  so i don't have any problem for ff and gc 
i think i am testing against the latest development version  i can recreate the error with this  gem 'selenium webdriver'  ' 2 45 0 dev2' require 'watir webdriver' b   watir  browser new  firefox b goto "www google com" t   b text_field  id    "gbqfq"  t focus #this will throw this error  selenium  webdriver  error  javascripterror  arguments 0  is undefined
 titusfortner   we just get the warning  we did a pry session to isolate the behaviour and ensure no other bad code was generating this warning  see below  100  reproduction rate with page object element calls 
this is what i use to open my browser and set a timeout for some of the pages that load longer the 60 seconds  it only happens at the end of the code when it closes the browser or if i cntl + c to interrupt it  if i close the test window with the red x manually  during a running test  no error 
yes i am running on geckodriver and firefox 50 1  that is probably the issue  i ran it in chrome as everything is working fine  i apologize for not running that in that browser before asking here  i will be sure to add that to my list of things to test before asking here again 
it's quite a bit different   cookie jars are an old netscape standard used in some modern apps for tracking session state  fortunately from my perspective i was able to leverage a cookie header instead  https   github com ninp0 csi blob master bin csi_arachni#l75 l98 on nov 18  2017 3 28 pm  "titus"  notifications github com  wrote  i'm not familiar with cookie jars  what functionality is needed that #to_a does not provide  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  https   github com watir watir issues 672#issuecomment 345476197   or mute the thread  https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth aa9jx70ua_lqocnsjlwwngkm3n1asytmks5s31ofgajpzm4qa7_9   
this is my misunderstanding of pep8 then 
sry for the noise  my example wasn't correct  the following is really missing a whitespace 
 2 4 1  pep8  1 5 7  pyflakes  0 8 1  mccabe  0 3 1  cpython 3 5 0+ on linux 
  installed via virtualenv    venv bin pycodestyle   version    2 3 0   venv bin python   version    python 2 7 12+
thank you for the replies  the example is a reduced version from a more complex case  but the point is  1   typing optional str   becomes  typing union str  nonetype   2  we analyse the union components using  parameter annotation __args__  3  in this case one of those components is  nonetype  i'm trying to compare to  nonetype   not  none   since the annotations are types  and do something different in that case  i could use  if issubclass arg  type none     but it feels a bit weird  since  nonetype  can't actually be extended 
python 3 6 7 pycodestyle  2 3 1
unfortunately  crash log  isn't updated when this happens  i've added  pp obj   at  checksummer rb 26  and now i get    system library frameworks ruby framework versions 2 0 usr lib ruby 2 0 0 prettyprint rb 311  stack level too deep  systemstackerror   during preprocessing i create index pages that reference sub pages and those sub pages in turn reference their index page  could this be the cause 
1 8 6  i should really upgrade    suspected as much about it being a kramdown issue  have mailed the author   seems to be a problem with os x's ruby 1 8 6 
yep  nope 
sure does  ruby  1 8 7p358  on mountain lion here 
hm  nope  the only line in the app referencing "default" is  rules   which specifies the layout like this   i re typed the whole  layout 'default''  line to verify that there are no invisible characters  but i still get the same  nanoc  identifier  invalidprefixerror  error 😢
my understanding is that the compilation process first builds an item dependency graph  this graph shouldn't have any cycle otherwise the compilation process cannot happen  once this acyclic graph has been built  the compiler walks the graph and builds items in the "right" order  to ensure items depending on others are built after them  that being said  the build of a given item is a two step process   first filter  then route  on a   given   item  routing should happen after filtering  and filtering shouldn't depend on routing  those are two sequential operations  the use case is pretty simple   content based cache busting  you route an item based on its compiled content  and add a hash at the end of the routed item  just like sprockets does  for example   this allows for far future caching headers  which are very useful  for example  the " style css" would be routed to  item identifier without_ext + sha1 item compiled_content  + " css"   and on the web server you can specify a 1year+ expiration date without worrying about cache expiration  if the stylesheet ever changes  so will its url 
oh  interesting  i tried that  and it didn't change the behavior for me  after removing the second image   nanoc show data  says that the first image depends on " nothing "  but it's outdated because "the code snippets have been modified since the last time the site was compiled"  let me know if i can provide a clearer way to reproduce this    
oops  my bad   that works perfectly  for handlebars and mustache  i'll open a pull request to modify the docs later  the  mustache  https   nanoc ws doc reference filters #mustache  layout should be edited to     yield    
i still see them from time to time  i'm running a variant with my patch  so they get processed as errors for me   it's not reliable  i haven't intentionally removed any links that triggered the issue  but the rate of occurrence has definitely gone down as i have cleaned up _other_ external link issues  i have a _lot_ of external link issues to clean up   that makes me wonder whether there's some leakage from one worker to another  or whether an exception in one thread can also result in an exception in another  i don't know whether those are things that can happen under ruby's threading model 
ok  i can definitely reproduce it with 4 9 1  and even sometimes with 4 9 0  but in that version  it is quite rare  could it be ruby 2 5 that messed it up   or am i one of the only ones that get to have that  
i'd like to avoid maintaining state from within the deployment automation itself  if  for example  the deployment were to fail halfway through and then retry  we could easily lose track of the state  or unique id  and end up with multiple maintenance windows  additionally  it would confine us to a single source for managing the maintenance state within our deployment process  for those reasons  i believe there needs to be an idempotent operation to both enable and disable maintenance mode  with flapjack maintaining the state via a toggle boolean  returning a unique id alone would not meet that requirement  i understand the standard set by nagios icinga is to rely on scheduled windows  but i also think that standard is being replaced by a model where maintenance states are used to toggle notifications for services that are intentionally stopped and started by automation  while the scheduled windows remain geared toward humans 
hey guys  sorry for the delayed response  i dont have time atm  you can simply close this issue and once i upgrade again  if i have the same issue i will re post 
here i assume i must  at least  apologize  i am totally unable to reproduce that "bug" on other pcs  i also removed the mime  types module from the machine i used when i logged that entry  perl makefile pl warns about the missing modules  what's the most likely is i totally missed the warning in the first place  i screwed up  sorry guys for this false alert  i suppose i owe you some beers then    keep on doing the good work  laurent ps  am i supposed to "comment and close" or not 
thanks for the quick reply  first  i thought about this and realised it won't be possible to do what i ask without breaking existing apps which rely on this behaviour  so on balance let's close this issue  in dancer 2 i guess the dsl can be overridden anyway     in answer to your question  i've found that dancer can sometimes get the redirect location wrong  depending on how the end user has set up the application and server  for example if   path is set in starman plack  inside the app we use uri_for and then in redirect   uri_for is called again to get the scheme  similarly i've seen https configurations accidentally generate non https links from redirect    imho it'd be better not to fiddle about at all with what the app developer sends to redirect    and rely on them to get it right in the first place 
 racke   load_app because that's how you configure "prefix" to have multiple modules for your website  unless something has changed in the recent past  that's the "standard" way to do that   nothing obvious in the docs 
i force installed the module and it works now  if i see this issue again i will create an issue ticket for test  tcp  marking issue closed 
my host is running http   burkeingraffia com phpinfo php  i have access to the root though  is there a setting i can change  please see  phpinfo php for more information 
while running with no arguments   lnav  is hanging on console  waiting for stdin     lnav  is crashed with segfault message when i put syslog file as argument  that's all test i've done  what should i do on next step 
aha    ok that is why it is not doing anything  is there possibility to do some sort of minimalistic regexp    saying something like if you see a line having the word 'warning'     show red   if a line shows 'error'   show 'orange' something like that  is that possible   if yes  how do i do it   thanx in advance 
yes  please reference my post log sample    #### may 18  2018 11 58 08 am cst  #### may 18  2018 12 00 53 pm cst  #### may 18  2018 12 06 30 pm cst  #### may 18  2018 12 06 33 pm cst  #### may 18  2018 12 45 37 pm cst  #### may 18  2018 1 20 10 pm cst  #### may 18  2018 1 38 07 pm cst  the sql output mapping idle_msec log   #### may 18  2018 12 45 37 pm cst  sql   437│ null│2018 05 18 12 45 37 000│ 2344000│warning │ is correct exactly   but next log line have error log  #### may 18  2018 1 20 10 pm cst  sql   471│ null│2018 05 18 12 45 37 000│ 0│warning │ the log_time should be "2018 05 18 13 20 10" not repeat "2018 05 18 12 45 37 000" which already displayed   i think it also cause idle_msec count got wrong  
as much as i am trying to learn about the cool stuff that you can do with  lnav  to unclutter a chatty log  like filtering  parsing and markings     i still feel that i just want to freeze the view for a couple of minutes to investigate an issue and then continue  i think it would be a useful feature  many of my colleagues ask me when i am presenting  lnav  capabilities to them  "how you can stop it for a while " anyway  thanks for your answer  i wanted to be sure that i haven't missed this feature 
the call looks like this 
i'm using node v4 0 0
no  as mentioned  the function in the dll gets called once  and it pumps back a lot of data  line by line  by "pumps" i mean fprintf  s a char array in to a stream   currently a file stream   that fprintf is called in an openmp thread  so i wonder if using this method  https   github com node ffi node ffi issues 72#issuecomment 8597655 would work cross thread  as this kind of callback might do the trick  instead of a stream  
thanks  tootallnate for looking inside the create_session function within c code i cannot access the function as it not attached to struct and i cannot assign function within c code  this means the function is not being invoked in javascript  pseudo code is  hope this makes sense

till yesterday i used filer from git  and now i'm using filer 0 9 4  howewer there's no much difference  as far as i know  and cmsplugin filer 0 9 5  i didn't try to rollback filer  but already tried all versions of other software  django  django cms  uwsgi  
hi   after some investigation  i found a way to load fixtures in the right order  apparently filer had some dependencies that needed to be also reflected on the way fixtures are loaded  this wasn't a django polymorphic related problem   thank you for you support

hey  technoweenie these are all things that we tried as well and got the same results  glad i'm not going mad  unfortunately the server's out of my control  it's a third party endpoint  we've a default in place for this  but the nil status definitely feels odd that no exception would be raised at the library level  which felt like a standard generally

i was  guessing  only since ruby 2 2 since i hit this trying to up our builds from ruby 2 1 to 2 2 it looks like you define rb_gc_guard to be a no op if it doesn't exist  i was assuming backcompat there with pre 2 2 gcs 
i'm solve my issue  problem is the bundler  that needs to be configure to pass needed variables  sorry for noise 
this is what works   get latest libffi 3 2 1 built and installed on the system   ensure pkg config is able to detect libffi  else set the pkg_config_path path  example pkg_config_path  usr local lib pkgconfig     ruby ffi gem builds successfully and tests are also green  since it uses the system installed libffi and not the internal 
understood  some of my co workers were getting errors trying to pull down that version of the gem   bundle update ffi  fixed everything just fine

https   gist github com kugel  20412b414ea5a10ea55079d9b43c82e8 i have marked the location that hangs and also the workaround using  rbffi_frame_push  that makes it work  look for uppercase comments   i call ruby startup code correctly i think  i can see in ruby ffi code that "has_gvl" in per thread frame stack is initialized to false 0 so it makes sense that this hangs  the if   has_gvl  code in function c executes pthread_cond_wait   which hangs  this can be observed in the gdb backtrace  see https   github com ffi ffi blob master ext ffi_c function c#l482  i except rbffi_frame_current   returns null  which is why i attempted my workaround to simply add a frame to the stack and it works 
done this one too  #675  regards  iain
hi  larskanis  my mistake  i thought referencing it that way would automatically open the request  i've opened the request  #674  regards  iain
hi lars  i checked on my mac and they seem to be  libname abi dylib   so  libglib 2 0 0 dylib   in this example  that's certainly how anaconda and homebrew name their libraries  at least  they have a symlink from  libname dylib  to the most recent abi  but i don't know if those are always present  in any case  including the abi version should always locate the correct library  i hope  you're right  windows is much more complex  the  name abi dll  pattern works for the libraries i use  but i'm sure many other standards exist 
i could figure what makes it went wrong  when configuring poly ml  i was mislead by the    with portable  option name  which i erroneously though was to build two compilers  a native one and a portable one   i though later again about this option  reconfigured poly ml 5 5 2 without it  recompiled it  then tried to recompiled hol4 again  and it just finished with no errors  so  as a conclusion  there is a bug in poly ml  well  two bugs  if i count another  and the hol4 install file may tell about this potential issue  suggesting to try to use a poly ml built without    with portable   if ever building hol4 failed  as a side note  i feel the install file should explicitly tell there is no install procedure after the build  and so hol4 needs to be built in place  in its final directory location  i don't know if i should close this report or not  i'm living this decision to your own will 
i think that it is wiser to let you fix that  as you are far more aware of how hol and its test infrastructure work  even if i believe that this should be a big deal to fix 
not sure  i wrote it out of 4 or 5 scripts together and also included it into my install howto for sage    hope i added all points in there  but would be a good way to reread it again  my suggestion for it would be to add a new useflag like server to the sage ebuild  that one loads and installs the script and from  etc portage savedconfig sci mathmatics sage we could read a default config for the server options that could be included in the init file so that the number of clients in background could be autosetted       the final 4 steps would be easy to solve and run by every admin himself     d procedure would be to start the server once by hand  if automated ghostuserinstall would work  we would just need to create an ssh key and parse it to every ghostuser that would be all    it could be easily documented in the wiki here

it looks like the same problem occurs on both ubuntu 14 10  macosx 10 9  on which both very recent version of eclipse is installed  from the eclipse luna sr1a "ide for java developers" download   i tried with a libgdx project at first but i can reproduce the problem with a bare minimum java project created from eclipse using only system out println  eclipse buildid 4 4 1 m20140925 0400 eclim version  2 4 1 3 ge91dcb4 here's the log if you immediately do  javadebugstop or exit from vim 2015 02 25 19 20 52 626 info  org eclim plugin jdt command debug context debuggercontext  starting debug session at localhost 8000 for vim instance  testdebug 2015 02 25 19 21 27 765 info  org eclim plugin jdt command debug context debuggercontext  stopping debug session 2015 02 25 19 21 30 766 error  org eclim command main  command failed org eclipse debug core debugexception  org eclipse jdi timeoutexception  timeout occurred while waiting for packet 44  occurred disconnecting from vm  caused by  org eclipse jdi timeoutexception  timeout occurred while waiting for packet 44      28 more

hi javan  yep rails 3 has a rakefile  but it looks a little different  this is the contents of a standard rails 3 rakefile  require file expand_path '   config application'    file    require 'rake' require 'rake testtask' require 'rake rdoctask' rails  application load_tasks so i'm guessing that the require file      line is the problem as it has changed from before  if all you need is the root path of the rails app  if it exists   could you not do something like  begin rails_path   rails root to_s rescue nameerror nil end which would assign a local variable the path of the rails app  if it exists   you could then call this whenever you need it  as far as i can tell this will work across rails versions  but if for some reason you needed to test for the version you could just use conditionals with rails version  it's quite late here so hopefully this makes sense and i haven't said or done anything stupid 
yes  i tried   not sure if a simple check for a closing ' at the end of the command is enough to handle all cases correctly   
i have resolved this request actually i only need gem_path bundle_path  but whenever default only set path  i found setting way in test code  in schedule rb env  path  'path to path' env  gem_path 'path to gem_path' done 
sorry  gemset is selected by rvm not rails    rvm use  ruby version   gemset  my application has a  rvmrc file in  var www apps subscribe  rvmrc with rvm use ruby 1 9 2 p0 subscribe the stack trace tells me the crontab task is picking up the system default gemset that doesn't have bundler installed
no  but   users ankit   has an   rvmrc  file  its contents are 
it displays the rvm "welcome" text block  then kicks off the  todo send_all  script 
thanks  this works for me too 
this is a stupid question but how do i actually run it manually  here is the output   10 17        bin bash  l  c 'cd  home username u apps appname releases 20120731053237    rails_env production bundle exec rake  s sitemap refresh   silent     home username u apps appname releases 20120731053237 log cron log 2  1' 
i was just looking at if from sysadmin perspective  since crontab is seen by admin out of schedule rb context it just makes it easier to read and understand what is scheduled to run and how often  i do understand though  that this is not something you may want to address 
 javan  it already placed after bundler  rywall  thank you very much  updating bundler on local machine solved it   after that i've removed whenever version constraint from gemfile  run  bundle update   commited  pushed and  cap deploy  deployed my app successfully 
thank you for your reply  it is my mistake  i run whenever  i twice  so kind of you  thank you again
sorry about truncating that    relevant line in config deploy deploy rb  
thanks for the reply  rud   i am checking 
thanks for the pointer  will do 
indeed  so there's no advantage in using set   andset   or   propertyname  its just a matter of syntax  i should go with the one that reads better  right  
the use case is that i want to instantiate real class without calling the constructor  constructor has additional logic which i don't want to execute in particular test 
i am working on a test for the  __call    method of an abstract class  https   github com phpdocumentor phpdocumentor2 blob develop src phpdocumentor descriptor descriptorabstract php#l346 l356 here is what i tried  the last assert fails  as it returns  null  http   bin cakephp org view 806755526 if i comment that out it passes  which makes you think all  shouldreceive    and  with    conditions are met  but changing those values will not fail the test  so besides not being able to get the  __call    logic executed  mock methods dont generate fails  no matter correct or wrong argues being used  i tracked down the issue a little bit  and the problem is that it checks if the method is callable on the parent  which is always true when having  __call    defined https   github com padraic mockery blob master library mockery mock php#l276
doesn't the  andthrow  method only accept a string as reference to the exception to be thrown  i'll give it a spin 
ah  my bad  many thanks  with mockery  close   works nicely 
mocking would work  but it might not work for every test scenario because it would fail the test before being able to assert other stuff  i could open a pr for cloning the arguments before passing them to the  mockery methodcall  object  but i'm not sure if this would be wanted behaviour because it could break tests using the current implementation

hi   pengwynn  that works great and it doesn't seem to show the errors i received last time  however  i'm getting  different types of failures  https   gist github com rafalchmiel 32fa1ddae588bf7e5c71  from the  octokit  client  events    octokit  client  gists  and  octokit  client  organizations  modules  any ideas on why i'm getting  these failures  https   gist github com rafalchmiel 32fa1ddae588bf7e5c71  
hey  pengwynn   as a quick workaround  we started using  repo rels  git  href  instead of  repo rels  ssh  href   because   for our purposes at least   they are pretty much interchangeable    so no  i didn't test any version permutations yet  on that note  i blame the bug on  sawyer v0 7 0  in my exposé above  but i have no concrete evidence for that  it could be an issue in  addressable v2 4 0  or indeed  octokit rb v4 3 0  itself for that matter    i may have some time later today to dig a bit deeper  in which case i will report back here 
thanks for your reply  i tried      what should i do 
hah  it seems that i was using  get  in a  wrong way  https   github com octokit octokit rb blob 28a594ff371ff3faf8ec50dd25bd65bd779ff43f lib octokit connection rb#l190   it should be   it would be nice to have this in readme

hi stuk  as i understand it  'text plain  charset x user defined' is the only way to keep the browser from destroying binary data that comes from an ajax call  source  https   developer mozilla org en us docs dom xmlhttprequest sending_and_receiving_binary_data and it is the only way i found that data length is actually equal to the file size on the server  so i guess the source data is alright  i tried what you proposed anyway  now chrome won't even open the link   error message below  i guess it is because the base4 string is too short  same with safari 
a lot of libraries are including the typings files out of the box  the advantages would be users that don't completely understand typings or how typescript works wouldn't have to figure out how to use typings since it would be included in the node module  if it is in the node module it's automatically imported by webpack  systemjs  or whatever transpiler you are using  you could just say in the readme if you are using this with es6 typescript run npm install   save  types es6 promise  types jszip with      reference path "path to typings file"    if the typings isn't automatically added to the path  issue i had was typescript syntax checker wasn't finding the module  even the import was in the global scope  by adding the typings file it got the structure of the object it needed  and stopped complaining about it not being able to import the module properly  granted since type checking is only during transpiling  the variable jszip was still usable in the transpilled javascript as you would in normal javascript  it was specific to the transpiling portion of my application

this is my code that does zip    stuk sorry for that i don't know how to upload the error zip file 
yep an asynchronous version of the api  i'm for replacing the sync api  though that might not bode well with everyone  so it currently works well for small files though  if one was to zip 50mb  dependent on client  worse on mobile   the browser would most definitely hang   bad user experience  if you split computation across multiple ticks of the event loop  it would be possible to show progress and still allow the user to interact with the page while it archives  this could further be improved with web workers   with double quadruple archive speed increase  i'm interested in using this library though haven't yet due to this and i understand that this would be quite a large architectural change so let this be food for thought anyway on wednesday  april 23  2014  david duponchel  notifications github com javascript _e  7b 7d 'cvml' 'notifications github com'     wrote

hi  i haven't been around the windows computer i had used to test this  it isn't an issue on mac because a user cannot create hidden files   i can send you a test file tomorrow  when you say it doesn't filter out hidden files  do you mean that it makes no distinction between hidden and regular files  or that it is not built to process hidden files 
no equal names  when i debugged this case  i remember that the names were okay  from '0 jpg' to '6 jpg'    but then i looked into the "zip" file and it wasn't fully loaded from that array    talking about the frequency   it does not appear often  though it appears often enough to be noticed  the funny thing is that the bug could appear when i was trying to download the images for the first time my stuff has loaded and when i tried like 20 times in a row after that   it was ok  really strange
i have used the combination of methods of loadasync and async methods to obtain the image content in base64 and showed it on the browser

ooooops    yes  indeed  one should always use git clone to get the latest instead of picking some 1 2 1 version via this web interface    sorry  and thanx a billion for this wonderful piece of software 
actually  i use version 1 2 from https   github com rmccue simplepie downloads  but in source inc it has define 'simplepie_version'  '1 2 1 dev'   perhaps current version from trunk has this bug fixed  but we don't use simplepie anymore because our rss loader migrated to java  thank you

no  i'm using php 5 2 17 
i wonder if the demo site uses a newer version of simplepie  this still fails for me  the same url also works fine in lastrss  thanks for responding  charles 
i needed to install php xml and chase up some dependencies  then wait for a cache timer to expire  closing the ticket

ah  looks like that'll work  so i guess this is a non issue  sorry 
the repo  http   repo1 maven org maven2 com github fommil netlib netlib native_system linux i686 1 1   doesn't work   "com github fommil netlib"   "all"   "1 1 2" pomonly    doesn't work  same errors are displayed  by the way  i use  sbt gen idea  to build my project  0 8 snapshot can be pulled  but i am not sure if it contains native lib 
hm  i actually didn't read about    keep merged sections   my fault  but it didn't help either 8o  it works for properties but not for methods  example 
as i mentioned above  i tried    finalize docset  in combination with    publish docset  and    install docset   separately   should i try it alone  if that works  a lot of people might be confused when their appledoc build doesn't install the documentation to xcode anymore  the commit comment indicated that _finalize_ was separate from _install_  make available in xcode viewer  
i'm still on mountain lion so don't have xcode 6
as in the example above     currently appledoc puts the whole method signature on a single line  it would be more readable to print in on multiple lines  like apple does  
thanks djanowski  yes  that works of course  i can live with that   should i close 
turned rdbcompression back on  restarted redis  and am now monitoring the server  and there are no exceptions – even after calling resque enqueue 150 times  this bug doesn’t want to be found 
 djanowski it occurs uninterruptedly in a rails application  the time interval is about 3 4 hours  so it is hard to reproduce  you can have a look at the  log file  https   gist github com 1730994  of the resque worker

great  thanks  pietern  i've been on holiday for a couple of weeks so haven't been able to double check head fixes it myself but others seems to have got it working off of head before me 
i suspect leaving the action as a symbol and just updating the documentation would be the better route  i can certainly send a pr   eloquent ruby  https   www informit com articles article aspx p 1681756   and other guides such as  this  http   www randomhacks net articles 2007 01 20 13 ways of looking at a ruby symbol#8  suggest using symbols for keywords passed to methods 
 djanowski thanks for looking at #467  as i said  the fix was there but performance were really bad due to the mass threading implementation  #472 is a way better implementation that fixes the issue as well 
 yaauie thanks for the reminder  i missed that out  does the redis server version has to be the same as the version of redis gem used 
i am using batteries 1 2 2 your example  and mine  both work fine in the standard toplevel  and indeed in compiled code   for the problem to exhibit itself  you must compile a custom toplevel  for example using the instructions i gave above

hi bartosz  so far i was unable to reproduce this in a test case  but have three cases in my cucumber test suite where this error shows  i will digg further into this and let you know if i was able to build a simple testcase to reproduce the error 
it would be my pleasure 
i'm almost certain it's not to do with pry  i was using pry to figure out why the test was hanging   i'll try to narrow down a minimum repro gist  i just wanted to confirm that these features were meant to play nicely together before i went investigating deeply  on mon  nov 4  2013 at 3 06 pm  bartosz blimke notifications github comwrote 
 bblimke my sensor model contains an url which is called to retrieve sensor data  the external service returns json  i'm using functional tests at the moment 
it's actually the instruction's placement between the actual request and the stubbed ones  my process when i get a  webmock  netconnectnotallowederror   1  review the actual request to make sure it's at least reasonable  2  assuming the actual request looks ok  check the stubs  do they look reasonable  3  if the stubs look ok  i do a human powered diff of the stubs and the actual request  the human powered diff is made much more difficult by having to skip over the instructions  frequently  my eyes get lost it them  maybe i'm doing it wrong 
confirmed  it's fixed in the latest release  sorry for not checking the obvious 
a simplified version of the code  looking at the tests i see that it is silly doing it this way  though it works  i might have to rewrite the tests 
we havn't loaded cucmber in gem file  please close this issue
 bblimke yes  it works 
this work for on of them  email is part of the body  i am using rspec with rails
  had started on one  but couldn't get a couple of the dependencies to install   eventmachine  and  unf_ext      got it sorted  thanks vagrant   here's what i came up with  #597 
 bblimke i can confirm that 2 0 0 beta1 solve this issue  thanks 
because if i add the domain that it's complaining about it'll complain about another and then another and so on  also  i can't be sure that the sources they use will remain the same it the future  so it makes more sense for me to disable everything but  localhost    
yup that's the commit i mentioned above

i need the matrix primarily for linear algebra  the row column names are for convenience in not having to think hard about what rows and columns represent after linear algebra operations  anyways  it was just a suggestion  feel free to close this out if its unlikely to happen  camuvingian   not sure what you mean by nasty  there's nothing wild about having row column names for matrices  as i mentioned  this is a core feature of r and r is used by lots of people  so there is clearly a community that sees value in this 
for patch i mean a submatrix  like i do in the sample code i pasted previously  basically you extract a series of submatrixes from the original matrix  and apply the same function to all the submatrixes  for example convolution   http   ufldl stanford edu tutorial images convolution_schematic gif or pooling   http   ufldl stanford edu tutorial images pooling_schematic gif this is  for example  extremely important in convolutional neural networks for computer vision and natural language processing  some of the most common tasks are   pointwise multiply each submatrix by another matrix and sum all the elements in every result  as you see in the first gif  take the average of each submatrix as in the second gif  take only the maximum value of each submatrix the results of those operations should all be matrices  however i'm not sure about what should be the return type of the invoked function  since sometimes it is a decimal number  and sometimes a matrix itself i already did some tests and this type of tasks benefit a lot from parallelisation  almost 3 8x performance boost going from singlethreaded to multithreaded by swapping the parallel for in the code i showed with a regular for

yes  the library i am working on must stored in the gac  i know there are alternatives  but they will make things tough due to the fact this library is being built on a remote build server  is there a way around this  thanks 
it's not really an issue of accuracy but more of an issue of knowing what the accuracy is  i can use almostequal and or math round to deal with this when comparing vectors  etc  but is there a way to determine what is the minimum parameter i can safely provide to those methods   or basically  what is the accuracy of these operations  if you can provide a link to an article on this subject it'd be great

thanks  that works like a charm   i was using boto 2 9 6 as well  for me every call on os x box was stalling  prior to the change 
note that i have one other cluster  zoneccluster  running in the background  hopefully that doesn't affect anything
sorry guys  garcia jj is right  datanucleus jpa 1 1 5 is not part of vraptor  my mistake 
the serialized object
ok guys  i've updated to vraptor 3 5 2 snapshot and it has solved the problem  thanks a lot 
hey somehow it is gone now  sorry for that 
let me know if you need any further info 
sounds like a good idea
i installed vifm git via the aur  arch   so i believe it is on that commit yes  i enabled millerview with filepreviews and it crashes on scrolling past certain files  a simple 28 byte text file for example 
yeah  nothing is visible when it runs  but i'm thinking this might be the problem  i have both a spec opts file and a parallel_specs opts file  spec opts   and i was hoping i could figure out how to make this work with parallel_test  http   ekenosen net nick devblog 2008 12 better progress bar for rspec 
thanks for the reply  irb  env 'parallel_test_processors'     "4"   echo parallel_test_processors parallel_test_processors   echo  parallel_test_processors 4

yes  its working correctly  the main problem was that gradle treats 3 1 and 3 1 0 differently  and i didn't think it was a problem on my end because mvnrepository com didn't show 3 1 0 either  thanks for your help 
hi  thank you for your response  i just changed the dependency and used 3 3 version with no luck   java io eofexception   this is the code i use   test2 txt  https   github com haraldk twelvemonkeys files 578993 test2 txt  inside the zip file you will find one of the tiff files i am having problems   ipc zip  https   github com haraldk twelvemonkeys files 579005 ipc zip  thanks 
it built after i ran  mvn package  first in the  common  folder  then in the root folder 
well  a work around to also support the vanilla document would be to get an imageinputstream over the in memory object  like this   this is how i'm doing it in my image viewer  since i need to use a vanilla document to do some xml tweaking  would this be interesting  i know it is not that elegant  i mean  converting an already parsed document to bytes to let batik re parse it again later  but i'm using it and it is quite fast  i mean  i don't know what happens if the svg file size is in the order of mb

hi daniele  apologies for the delay in replying  i upgraded ubuntu and php  v is returning php 5 3 3 1ubuntu9 1 with suhosin patch  cli   built  oct 15 2010 14 17 04  but i am still getting the same error  i had a look around to see if anyone had reported similar bugs but couldn't find anything  i'll try it on some other machines to see if i can narrow it down 
i was just verifying it manually using the redis cli  maybe because i am just plainly running the redis server from its source directory  i'll try to pass a config file to the redis server and see what happens 
ahh thanks i am running inside a transaction  i did not have issues with this code when running against redis 3 0 t btw    so should i just map the keys from the iterator to an array outside of the transaction  thanks for the quick response 
i'm sorry i was not clear  i was referring to the maxmemory value in  etc redis conf  do all instantiated predis clients share the maxmemory limit  e g  if i create a predis client for session handling and a predis client for application data caching  both in the same php script with different prefixes   will the predis clients share the 100mb maxmemory limit  i'm assuming they share it  but just wanted to confirm  thank you 
switch to phpredis
you can see it here in your code http   cl ly 0s0m091u3r2u121f243a that means  if you set verify_ssl to false  or leave it blank  verify_ssl     false   so it is false    than it pass condition in the first line  thats ok  but if you set verify_ssl to openssl  ssl  verify_none  that is 0 integer  than it goes to second condition  which is wrong i think   
yes  my fault  sorry 
yes  i was wondering whether any level of js would be supported  like in some headless browsers  i'm not telling that's necessary  just asking 
sure thing 
no i mean i dont have the json i expect as a response  instead i get a string in the body  this only happens when i return 400 error from web api serveur  asp net 
i add subdomain on mailgun like 'mail abc com' but was using abc com while sending email  not sure  if you are facing same thing or noit
it's sub optimal because i won't get specific messages from those assertions  i'm going to try and use rspec matchers inside this block instead 
pasting an example below  they all seem to break however 
 myronmarston ta da  https   github com jjb rspec expectations issue 232 see spec models foo_spec rb
the real scenario is as follows  i need to check if controller actions have the expected authorizations   but besides the annoying side effect that the proc is now executed at least three times  i also have the side effect that is the first expectation is failing  the second one is also reported as failing 
thanks for the help   myronmarston   would've taken me a lot of time to track this down  that did indeed fix the problems  i submitted a pr over at db query matchers  closing because fixing this in rspec expectations has gotten it's own pr by now   
does it continue to work if sync is a thor class  i think that might be causing the issue 
 myronmarston thanks for taking the time to explain that  the   have_attributes  documentation  https   relishapp com rspec rspec expectations docs built in matchers have attributes matcher  says  i inferred that the opposite behavior  triggered by  not_to   would be to "pass if any of the attributes don't match"  in hindsight  i realize that sentence can also be inverted as "fails is any of the attributes matches"  maybe we could clarify that in the docs  i can submit a pr to  the docs  https   github com rspec rspec expectations blob master features built_in_matchers have_attributes feature  if you are interested  regarding why i want  have_attributes  to work that way  i expected to use it to ensure a resource is not updated when provided invalid attributes  as in the following spec  rspec describe peoplecontroller  type   controller do describe 'patch #update'   focus do let   person    factorygirl create  person    context "with invalid attributes" do let   invalid_attributes  do factorygirl attributes_for  person  first_name  'john'  last_name  nil  end it "does not update the requested person" do patch  update  id  person  person  invalid_attributes person reload expect person  not_to have_attributes invalid_attributes  end end end end after discovering that  have_attributes  did not work as i initially expected  i have replaced the above example with the following  it "does not update the requested person" do expect   patch  update  id  person  person  invalid_attributes person reload   not_to change  person  end
### base feature  now you can see exactly the line of each failure                                    yes  we would like to do this change  we saw some methods in rspec core that has something like this  do you think we can copy that methods from there  or  rspec core is one dependention of rspec expectations 
well  i had a newline missing  man_facepalming 
i wanna multiple use 【include_once " xxx prepend php" 】，but the result will cover the lats one  how can i get the aggregation of multiple result not the final result 
no  the problem is the opposite  i _want_ to have it encoded  just to   quot   not   "  a followup question is why you decided to escape it to   "  and not to   quot   like the rest of the chars  was it based on an actual need in some situation  i couldn't find a test in your solution that actually tested it  i only found the one that tested the     character

it happens to me after chrome updated    v51 
i see the icon  i can right click to see preferences but i do not see how to use it to jump somewhere  with nautilus    
 joelthelion   agreed  i think the latter represents the most flexible and simplistic option moving forward  it's akin to the    bash_history to me  good idea 
yes  it does — thanks for clarifying  i guess i don't see a reason for the shorter  j  to remove this functionality  though 
nope  cannot reproduce the issue after install from source

in case my code breaks at server  the server sends the http status code say 500  first point is in error callback i got responsetext as null what i registered instead what i send which was error json  e g say error  errorcode   error msg    to rectify this issue i had to set the http status code manually to 200 and collect error json in responsetext  please let me know do i need to explain more 
was writing an example and realised i had a if statement in ajaxsuccess so that i only get a success message on http post requests   if i don't use jquery form to submit the form this works  but with jquery from the settings type is post and not post  hope this helps to narrow it down  if you still need a test page let me know and i'll create one 
i'll try to get one together tomorrow  worked around it today with an additional rails route for ie 
no that's not issue  i have maximum 50mb upload limit on my server  some big files upload even larger than 1mb   some files do now  those are  pdf format  i will send you the files in few hours 
hi  thanks for the quick answer  here it is  http   csa ru  kef public jfie html  please  see console output when pressing the buttons 
i meant  since the hack used for ie 9 is to use iframe  which is essentially not an ajax call to the server   you need to respond to the request accordingly  the way to check for an ajax call is to usually check the " _server 'http_x_requested_with' " value  if it is an ajax call you ignore it in case of ie  and if it's a non ajax call you return a response  which is loaded in the iframe   there's some information regarding that here  http   malsup com jquery form #file upload
sure  i'd be happy to share my changes  besides having the changes committed to my branch  are you suggesting another way for me to give you my fix  https   github com vykluong form git
wanna add custom response especially on failed request
thanks  i'm on ghc 7 6 1  the output from ghc pkg list is shown here   https   gist github com 4010946

i updated cabal  and unregistered re installed hakyll  and now i can run    site watch   so i just had an old version of cabal  so this ticket can be closed  for reference  how to i determine which version of hakyll i am currently running  thanks 
ok  solved  the problem was mixing cached binary obtained via hydra in nixos installation  hakyll is fine  if anyone encounters this problem on nixos  i'd advise to do a  nix channel   update nixos   and not messing around with hydra builds  you can close  sorry for the inconvenience   
sounds good  i already have some code for turning yaml lists into hakyll lists here  https   github com beerendlauwers haskanything blob master src haskanything internal field hs#l133 we could have a function that returns  maybe either  a  string  or a   string    pattern match on that and return a  stringfield  or  listfield  accordingly  bonus points if we make the  listfield  path recursive  so we can have nested yaml lists    i'll see if i can whip up a pr this week 
in this case  i'm using gulp to compile es6 javascript code into es5 code and since i'm already using gulp  along with babel and rollup  for that  i figured to also use it for the sass stuff 
yes  it was the problem  thanks   
i was on  lts 7 16   i've tried starting over on another new instance with the same os  but as i explicitly specify    resolver lts 7 14  during  stack install hakyll   i get

lol    wrong project    but  by the way  is it possible with nsubstitute  
i think that the essence of the problem is lack of synchronization  standard generic dictionary class does not guarantee thread safety  the run with nullreferenceexception also shows that something's up 
 nsubstitute core quantity  https   github com nsubstitute nsubstitute blob master src nsubstitute core quantity cs   for an example of your library using it  see the implementation of   public static t received t  this t substitute  int requirednumberofcalls  where t   class   https   github com nsubstitute nsubstitute blob 509dccd1414b234c0c9d3100a935424dfe223bbd src nsubstitute substituteextensions cs#l248  et al 
 alexandrnikitin thank you for the documentation  we are running most our tests in parallel via nunit console runner  i'll be sure to audit the places we are seeing the exception bubble up to make sure we are configuring nsubstitute outside of test execution to avoid issues  fwiw this is the only case we have run into issues with threading  it seems like that  lazythreadsafetymode  should be either  publicationonly  or  executionandpublication  if the long term goal is to support better thread safety  the  autovalueprovidersfactory  constructor is an interesting pattern as it creates a self referencing loop 
i'd be curious to understand your approach if you have a slow setup method and you want to test many things about it  do you just create a single test with a boatload of assertions 
this is where mock records method calls  right 
 zenspider i closed this ticket because i misread the code for how the stub feature works with minitest 
good question  i'm not sure any of them are deal breakers  but i just thought there might be a more "official" way  one small thing is that i seem to need to  dup   argv   because minitest run  seems to modify the args object passed in  that doesn't seem ideal  another thing is having to call  minitest  runnable reset   is that part of minitest's published api  i e  is it safe for me to rely on it  one last thing which isn't an issue in my example project is when doing this kind of thing in a project which makes use of  minitest autorun   you have to be careful to reset the runnables in the right places to avoid tests running twice 
i have this "alarm" system where an alarm starts a thread  each alarm has different procs  i just wanted to test out that the proc really gets called and gets called only once  since each alarm can repeat lots of times but the thread should be started only once   my workaround was to catch the exception in the  proc  and exit right there  maybe just put some guidance on the readme so people knows how it works with threads 
well  i can try to dig further in the ruby code and the windows api if you want  but my reading of _this is ruby internal buffering only  the os may buffer the data as well_ is that the _process_ itself might still buffer it  with no guarantee that _another_ process could see that content until it actually reaches the disk  at least  this interpretation is consistent with what i observed  no  it's even worse than that  now i remember  i also tried to _reopen_ the temp file with a  file read  just after the   flush   and it returned an empty string   
i see it like this    screen shot 2017 01 05 at 11 42 33 am  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 26019 21668370 20dda0c8 d33c 11e6 9b94 83dc426a6054 png   utilum do you see it same   zenspider is it expected to be empty

i just realised i can simply resolve the issue by declaring djnago a dependency in my projects setupy py   so please consider the issue close for me 
hi  django 1 9 1 and feincms 1 11 4  i can test on 1 9 2 soon as well  but i don't remember anything in the release notes that would affect this 
ah seems this was my mistake   i did not get that the migrations had to be created for the page module   just tried it for feincms itself  but it totally makes more sense for the page module  i dont really see why it worked in 1 8 however  but anyways seems like i can solve my problem  thank you and sorry for bothering   
thanks  mjl  good question     i've been  manually  testing it with both 1 8 6 and 2 0 10 of reversion  and i couldn't see any issues created in 1 8 6  i'd like to have made some automated tests  but it seems like you would need selenium or similar to do so   that's a big jump from where feincms is now  right  are there any quickly written tests you think might work  i am thoroughly aware of the danger of creating that expectation        it was not my intention i assure you 
i set the laptop as missing and none of the alerts would play or image be captured from the inbuilt webcam
i'm using arch and i tired both the aur version and dowloading the zip directly from the project page  same effect  any debug hint

thanks but i have already fixed the problem by doing just that  thanks any way danny
the keypad will only let me enter numbers  i tried relocking with a password of 1234 but this didn't work 
what i found was after i killed off all of the run away curls  but left the original process running  it stopped spawning additional curl and bash processes  it seemed to stabilize  originally  i killed all of the curl and bash processes and it just started respawning them  recently though i had a different program hang and corrupt my windows install  it appears that prey is still functioning properly  couldn't tell you why though  on sat  oct 1  2011 at 6 49 am  espink   reply reply github com wrote  ## james fowler 方志宇 santiago myazcomputerguy com rootless gmail com public key  http   rootless googlepages com fowler_publickey

is there any particular log file you are interested in  first of all  the selected storage option is not persisted  regardless that i select "plain text files" as the storage option  nv defaults back to "single database" on restart  when i start it  configure it to use plain text files  and try to create a node  the system log file contains the following lines  does this help 
did you notice anything that should be changed on that extconf rb  anything curb specific or something   if yes  i can change it before send the pull request 
the return code is  send_error  does that mean my request is improperly formatted

no i dont have the recursion problem  it was just the options thing  bcs i am making pretty dynamic calls where i dont want to stub those params  since you are probably about to update the doc site this ticket was just as a hint  thanks 2012 11 18 hans hasselberg notifications github com
 i0rek hmm wich release   i'm using  typhoeus  0 6 9   
yea  it worked before the update  d i like the new update  mainly because of oauth  xd
i tried your fix and got hung on a different step  so progress  now  i think it's the fact that my company has firewalled http   www twitter com that is stopping me  i'm getting a new error that still has to do with oauth  i can sign in using https   twitter com however  ouch   something bad happened to chrome bird while calling twitter's api  request token response  invalid oauth_token   html  body the url you requested has been blocked  url  twitter com oauth request_token  body   html  this problem is probably due to incorrect date and time settings in your operating system  please  review your settings and try again 
that did appear to fix the problem 
the new version doesn't work anyway    i open the link correctly
just use the extension i mentioned above  it works 
apparently none 
hi  ruby  ruby 1 9 1p429  2010 07 02 revision 28523   i386 mingw32  on windows   sqlite  sqlite3 ruby  1 3 0 x86 mingw32  i have installed surveyor as gem  not as a bundler though  regards   satish
i did re run the script generate  and my jquery surveyor js is up to date  unless there's a more updated version somewhere that doesn't get installed through the generator

tried random high ports such as 12345  like gerroon i also confirmed that forwarding ports with ssh commandline worked  now i've upgraded to a new rom and connectbot forwarding works again  so maybe it was a bug in the rom or some incompatibility 
yes i was trying this with ec keys  will update from master   rebuild and test
android 5 1 1 connectbot 1 9 2
moto g5  android 7 1 1 nougat  app version is whatever was installed from google apps a little over a month ago  after desperate attempts to log in i uninstalled it yesterday    so i guess i can't tell you the specific version used  by external   you mean physical keyboard  no  just "hacker's keyboard"  but i should note that it was installed _after_ setting up connectbot  and also i don't see the y n prompt so it's unlikely to be a keyboard issue  i hope   i should also note that some hosts which don't show the authenticity warnings work fine  auth is done with ssh keys only  all host settings in the app are identical for every host 
i also tried the latest post quantum key exchange  sntrup4591761x25519 sha512 tinyssh org  but connectbot does not accept this from my openbsd server  where it is still an experimental feature in openssh v8   this new key exchange from tinyssh org supposedly falls back on 25519  but not in a way that connectbot can use  i was hoping that it would just work  but i guess not 
no it doesn't it shows error that i wrote in first post 
modifing the extconf rb doesn't work  after running gem install again  it fails just like before and the extconf rb is overwritten to it's previous state
thanks for getting back to me quickly  that makes sense  but it doesn't seem to work either  after updating format  it complained about needing size set  once i set the size  i got this error 
yea figured it out  thanks 
i'm on a laptop with only 'return'  which would normally have the same effect  but it does not make the value stick

node implementation works fine  thanks 
i added a very simple server based on the node example  but i somehow can't get it to work properly  when trying to access http   0 0 0 0 9293 faye it doesn't respond  i guess my setup is wrong  though i installed the recent faye version via npm and the server starts and also responds with "bad request" when accessing http   0 0 0 0 9293  if this simple example works for you than i guess i'm just missing something  i'd be glad to provide more help on resolving that issue 
its the same loading issue  since i have faye on a different domain   although as i explained above directly making a request still takes time to complete
it seems to happen randomly  i will try to reproduce it and give you the example code  thanks for the quick replies 
good question     i just assumed since chrome uses a process per tab model that they are independent issues  but i was using a rest client in chrome to test the publish too  so that may be a possibility  i'll check it out asap 
still testing it  the results are inconclusive so far  i did a good number of quick tests  sleeping my computer and awakening it a minute later and saw no problem  so i was preparing to report success  but then when my computer slept as i was off to lunch  when i came back an hour later and woke it up  2 out of the 3 browsers had permanently lost their faye connections   chrome and firefox had lost connection  safari was ok  
because of some scanning system  evil request and error request 
i just updated the details  please have a look 
unfortunately  i can't post my app  i can post only code related to faye  messages i've posted above are request headers from chrome console  refreshing means that page refreshes by itself and it seems to me that it keeps subscribing the client over and over again  maybe the problem is with websockets  but i don't have any software that blocks them 
hello   jcoglan   i made simple example  which reproduce problem   i think  retry  5  in some way continue working  because if i change it to 10  error come later  if i changed  retry  to 2  when i have error after  2 second 
indeed  step 6 in the example is performed automatically by the faye client  it tries to reinstate the subscriptions it had  the automatic re subscription fails  because the signature isn't valid anymore  my faye server returns  403  authentication required  in that case  however  the  subscribe  promise has already successfully resolved  because of https   github com faye faye blob master javascript protocol client js#l205   leaving me unable to retrieve a new signature and resubscribe  that is why i added the hack using  transport  up down    but i'd rather use faye's automatic mechanism 
yes  thanks
interesting    the same effect  sorry for the noise  i'll report it on the luatex mailing list 
yes  consider this example  you create a view  you get a hud for that view using  showhudaddedto   next you get the same pointer to the hud using the  hudforview  method  and then you issue a  hud hide   at this point  if you rotate the screen of your device  the drawrect method in the mbprogresshud is called and  if the dimbackground property is set to true  even the background is redrawn  this leads to slowdowns  especially when on retina displays on ipads

allowing the passing of uri parts would certainly work  and it would probably be a benefit if you were working with fixed endpoints and wanted to adjust only the path or parameters  say with an api service   at zencoder we primarily use  excon verb  method calls so it would be most useful for us to have excon automatically use addressable  while we're not using excon in the area of the application that deals with the worst urls  when we want to it would be rather trivial to write a wrapper that parses the url using addressable and then manually uses excon  connection with the uri parts  on the other hand  this is essentially duplicating code that already exists within excon since addressable is api compatible with uri as far as the interface excon uses is concerned  i guess it's a toss up  then  on the one hand it's nice to avoid dependencies  on the other it's nice to have good  automatic uri parsing without having to resort to lower level interfaces  i think being able to pass in the uri parts is useful  but so is being able to swap out the uri parser   side note  on further reflection  i think my suggestion to try and require addressable before uri could lead to load order madness for users  so would probable be a bad idea  excon uri_parser   addressable  uri  
hi  geemus it is a ruby on rails application deployed to heroku  ruby version is 1 9 3
0 27 6
it works  thank you very much
i think sqs is using the idempotent flag  no  https   github com fog fog aws blob master lib fog aws sqs rb#l117 in my admittedly brief reading  once it gets to excon  it looks like the default retry_limit is 4  and there's no default retry_interval  and neither retry_limit nor retry_interval get passed to excon from the fog sqs class  so if i did pass the idempotent flag  it looks like it would retry 4 times in rapid succession  which seems unlikely to work  so maybe wrapping it myself and doing some retries with an exponential backoff might be the way to go 
many thanks  geemus   those changes resolve the original concern  and everything seems to work as expected    i'm using  excon  as a dependency of  fluentd's elasticsearch output plugin  https   github com uken fluent plugin elasticsearch blob master fluent plugin elasticsearch gemspec#l22   fluentd running with updated  excon  successfully performs http operations to elasticsearch

yeah   as a note for anyone else hitting this who can't upgrade   will work around this by returning a new tempfile which actually exists at that point   just note that your external program must be able to overwrite the output file if it already exists without interaction

ah sorry  i oversimplified  i'm actually passing the data to javascript code  polymer's  iron image  web component to be exact   it doesn't display and it also confuses the chrome development console  which identifies it as b64 encoded image but gives up after the newline  i imagine browser attribute parsing is more tolerant to this  i also checked the  data url scheme rfc  https   tools ietf org html rfc2397   which is silent on the issue  not really in the remit   however the  base n encodings rfc  https   www ietf org rfc rfc4648 txt  specifically prohibits the insertion of newlines in this context  that section in the standard basically appears to be a complaint about mime style encoding being overly prevalent  as evidenced by ruby's own base64 encoding being wrong by default 
hi  i'm using aws s3  0 6 2  dragonfly  0 5 7  ▸ ruby  v ruby 1 8 7  2010 01 10 patchlevel 249   x86_64 linux  i also tested this  and the fix  with the same gems on heroku with aspen mri 1 8 6 stack 
server returns 404  because request goes to my rails app  where i do not have such route  and when requesting from first domain   works fine 
hi mark  i'm using 0 6 2 of aws s3 
the region is set to "us standard" and i have seen this error at 10 20  of the time when i upload images 
yup that works  thanks
ok  sorry for the miss  my setup is "unusual" indeed  we use direct client side upload to s3  and assign the pre generated uid 
yeah   as a note for anyone else hitting this who can't upgrade   will work around this by returning a new tempfile which actually exists at that point   just note that your external program must be able to overwrite the output file if it already exists without interaction 
another error that i get is when i use the thumb method  convert  no decode delegate for this image format   var www apps demo releases 20120314151318 public system dragonfly production 1 3 150312_07_04_04_redmineversão png'   error constitute c readimage 532  convert  missing an image filename  tmp dragonfly20120315 24563 mcz34s 0'   error convert c convertimagecommand 3017     unexpected error while processing request  none of the functions registered with #dragonfly  processor 0x2b4883368890 were able to deal with the method call thumb # dragonfly  tempobject 0x2b4885cd1cb8 pathname # pathname  var www apps demo releases 2012031 "620x240#"   you may need to register one that can  cache   get  javascripts wymrails js 1331738005  miss cache   get  javascripts wymrails js 1331738005  miss convert  no decode delegate for this image format   var www apps demo releases 20120314151318 public system dragonfly production 1 3 150312_07_04_04_redmineversão png'   error constitute c readimage 532  convert  missing an image filename   tmp dragonfly20120315 24563 w7z38d 0'   error convert c convertimagecommand 3017     unexpected error while processing request  none of the functions registered with # dragonfly  processor 0x2b4883368890  were able to deal with the method call thumb # dragonfly  tempobject 0x2b4885cb1eb8 pathname # pathname  var www apps demo releases 2012031 "620x240#"   you may need to register one that can  thaks
nothing fancy really 
still was getting pdf as image  so solved with checking if the last 3 characters of image name    pdf
ahh good to know  i added it to the upgrade docs because that's where i needed it  thanks for 1 0  huge improvement 
note it completes rendering and then tosses an exception  however  if i do not update the image  it is fine  completed 200 ok in 6ms  views  3 6ms   activerecord  0 6ms  ioerror  closed stream

no  i didn't  now works thanks   
thanks for the answer  it works with internal mongodb app 
0 7 3  i ran git clone apr 18 
all our voip infrastructure is based on 4psa's voipnow  i'm not sure why   but unless the initial request is inbound with the authentication data   they simply decline it  to my mind   this is not rfc 3665 compliant   but given how widely used their systems are   i can't see them changing  i have asked though   the problem i have is two fold   firstly  i really don't like the idea of ip authing sip connections  and secondly  if we do allow calls based on ip   only one client per server will be able to interop with twilio  and  we had hoped to get more of our clients using your system   particularly for conference calls and ivr etc  is there any way to get the outbound call's initial contact to include the auth data 
weird  after re downloading the library it works  not sure what was going on there  thanks for your help 
no this doesn't help  there is no view being rendered so no html being generated  the function merely produces xml and returns it to twilio  also  please note the incorrectly formed single tag '  head   '  head tags are normally not self closing and come in pairs  ie    head         head     if i change the code to just say 'hello' like this it produces the same error 
i didn't used any network monitor i tried in two host using linux   host #1 debian  dreamhost com   linux gotti 2 6 31 5 modsign aufs2 grsec xeon #1 smp fri nov 20 20 08 17 utc 2009 x86_64 gnu linux php 4 4 9  cli   built  sep 17 2008 12 02 18  host #2  debian  mine   linux korrupzion3 2 6 26 8 #1 smp preempt mon oct 5 03 55 04 clt 2009 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux php 5 2 10  cli   built  nov 13 2009 11 44 05  they use the same code and have the same error that i posted above oh   wait  i tried in my local xampp server  windows 7 x64  apache  php 5 3 0   and it worked flawlessly  in what environment have you tested 
i'm doing this   i don't have the "data"  you can find the source here  https   github com destro ebot csgo blob master src etools rcon csgo php
of course     rcon_exec "hostname myhostname"  
i did and it does not work at all  no matter what port i use  it simply times out  i did a quick manual test by sending the getchallenge packet " xff xff xff xff x55 xff xff xff xff" to a servers port 27017 and i got s2c_challenge response which i used to send a2s_player and the server responded accordingly 
hello  i'm using the newest code from master and i have tested two different scripts 1  testing changelevel only   pre   test   new sourceserver '127 0 0 1'  27016    test  rconauth 'local'    test  rconexec 'changelevel de_dust'     pre  exception  could not read from socket  2  testing saying after changelevel   pre   test   new sourceserver '127 0 0 1'  27016    test  rconauth 'local'   try    test  rconexec 'changelevel de_dust'     catch  exception  e       test  rconexec 'say blub'     pre  exception  could not send data  warning  socket_send    unable to write to socket  32   broken pipe in    steam condenser php lib socket php on line 157 are you able to reproduce these exceptions 
sure  i will post some code fragment over the weekend for you  i get valid data for other methods  getappid    getlogourl    for example  for the same steamgame object that returns "null" for geticonurl    i´m getting "null" for all games i have  tks 
thank you very much  it is not really a bug  looking at the code it seems more like the desired behaviour  for example steam id 76561198098058712 
the above message was the error message  i believe that the error was thrown because of 30 secs maximum execution  or in the webapi class   in the part which "trigger_error was written"
this helped  however  problem is still unsolved

mhh  well  i think it is a bug  you are calling "getplayers" in order to get player information  internally it's calling "rcon status" and parses this  so there's no need of doing s2a_player before  this ddos protection is now standard on all vanilla servers as long as it's not disabled  these are the rcon commands 
oh yeah i forgot that there's multiple language support  this is java  and its these logs that im talking about
the issue is thrown when doing  players   sourceserver getplayers constants rcon   constants rcon is a static string that's populated at start  i'm trying to query all of my csgo servers here  https   www gametracker com search  query brutalcs searchipp 50#search is the java api more stable as a "socket application" rather than an application that connects  auths  fetches players  disconnects every 15 seconds  it feels like i'm always getting strange errors that shouldn't exist  so i'm probably doing something bad 
garry's mod
i tried using the latest tagged release 1 3 11 and when i saw the issue occur with that version i rebased our code against master head using the new namespaced style and had the same problem  we have a testing fork on our gitlab which is behaving well with our app  but it's just a hack to get it working and probably not the correct solution https   gitlab com oijfa projects steam condenser ruby commit 953c1a357f58d9f92042a113db64d022fe561ad5 the file in our app which calls the steam condenser code is here  https   gitlab com oijfa projects hlds web monitor blob master sven rb
okey dokey  +1  wait a few days 
done  the new issue is here  https   github com pgroonga pgroonga issues 21
it makes sense to not allow the creation of invoices for events not in the current school year  i think a clearer error message will help  for demosplash  i couldn't create an invoice when it was set to "details requested" 
except for "datetime"  "date"  "timestamp"  any type without a length because the regexp looks for a pattern like  type length     in my case "text" 
sorry  here is an example  class mo extends activerecord base   static  getters   array 'ge'   function get_ge     return "re"       mo   new mo    echo  mo  ge     exception the way that works  class mo extends activerecord base   static  getters   array 'get_ge'      why is get_ needed  function get_ge     return "re"       mo   new mo    echo  mo  ge  the documentation dictates the first way though 
i am not experiencing any "errors"  the only trouble i am having with it is that periodically i need to store data in either session or serialized in the db and it is taking up resources  its not an immediate issue  since i built a work around  more of something to look at  when i have a little more time  ill take a better look at it and submit a proposed fix 
yes  on the server this code is deployed to  running select   sql_mode  returns   from what i could tell  it looks like strict_trans_tables is the option causing the transactions to abort as the datetime format with timezone are is what the mysql datetime data type is expecting  when not in strict mode  timezones are automatically converted to the timezone of the database server  it looks like this might have to be done in php otherwise  thanks  dave on apr 21  2012  at 5 59 pm  yoan blanc wrote 
maybe it would be more correct   from method  model  create    we expect the model  object   with multiple insert need to get the number of records inserted  will not be the number of records returned by confusing a programmers  however  i 'm not sure how to do split batch on some queries  this is a very common and useful feature  i hope google translate clear translated the text 
no sorry    next time my logs alert me to nil body in a response i will let you know
thanks  justinstern and  peterjm for quick replies  i have a workaround for now in the capistrano script  this was barfing at me on rails 4 1 as well  there is a rubygems issue as well which may or may not be related  https   github com rubygems rubygems issues 1062 however  i can confirm that removing threadsafe version from gemfile  the dependency error doesn't happen  look forward to the threadsafe version integrated in activeresource 
those models seems to be modelled as same as address for example  billing_address     shipping_address   in https   help shopify com api reference order or  addresses     default_address   i have seen a  shopifyapi  customer  defaultaddress   in https   help shopify com api reference customer and also https   help shopify com api reference customeraddress got the same fields it would be easier then to implement a generic processing of whatever address object we have on our side 
 forsbergplustwo no  not really  if i remember correctly this was happening when ar was trying to deserialize an attribute that contained these objects  so i basically removed the serialize attribute macro from the ar models where they were defined  not really a fix per se  but sufficient for getting me past the issue of the day   p
hi  busfox thanks for your reply  with my code  i could get the order details except for billing address and shipping address  while i check this order in the store  there was no billing address and shipping address  sorry  this was resolved  thanks again 
yes  sorry  it was something really strange  when i rebooted my machine and tried again  the problem went away and i installed the last version successfully  please  close this issue as invalid 
it does not update with a cog when refreshing the list  the blue dot remains during refresh and after installing updates 
 okaestne does that mean there are no components installed

 magro thank you so much for your quick reply  i don't think this is the case  when i runned the deploy with the change described on my previous comment i saw these errors  with that change i've changed all my classes to be serializable and i've changed the serialversionuid in all of them  in theory  after this change every file should be serialized with the new serialversionuid  right  so every new session should be using the new classes  i can't get how i'm getting these errors if  in theory  the sessions are generated with the new logic and classes  ¿could be a jar versions issue  i've added every jar described in the docs  but i don't know if versions are valid for  memcached session manager 1 8 3 jar  and  memcached session manager tc7 1 8 3 jar   is there any way to debug or see a more descriptive log  thanks and sorry for bothering you

well  i guess i thought it was a problem because the main workers will take the jobs off the queue before the scheduler does  but maybe they're not real jobs  so it's a non issue  if you don't think it's a problem  it's probably not a problem

yes  please explain this in the readme  it is quite unclear otherwise 
i'm using version 3 0 0 rc5 of the gem  and whenever i change anything in my translation files in  config locales   the files in  app assets javascripts i18n   get re generated  when i make the next request to my rails app server  of course  not magically   this generates one  js file for each language locale i have  in my case i'm using english and spanish in my app  and i always get two files  en js  and  es js  in the assets directory mentioned above  since these files are not in   gitignore   whenever they have changes  they appear when i run  git diff   i don't mind this  but the fact that these files are generated as minified javascript json  means that the diff covers always the entire single enormous line of the whole file  which makes it impractical for me to examine the output of  git diff   i hope i'm making myself clear now  i would add these files to   gitignore   but then they won't get deployed to my production environment  and since i'm using heroku  i cannot configure my deploy to run the rake task that generates these files  as i would do if i were deploying using chef capistrano puppet on a regular linux server like in amazon aws  etc 
i18n js  2 1 2  and config i copypaste form wiki even for test but surely i do no remember the exactly config because i deleted it and gem too  probably it was like this 
hey  i am not doing anything special  application js  can it happen because you move these files from  vendor assets  to  app assets  
ah sorry  forgot to close out the issue  yep  that answers it 
sorry i had some days of vacation and just returned    hmm seems i messed something up  the specs are indeed green  dunno what i did there  maybe one shouldn't do such things just before vacation     as far as i understand the problem is that the  filtered_translations  function  https   github com fnando i18n js blob master lib i18n js rb#l74  is never called during the  export  call  it is indeed called in this js file  https   github com fnando i18n js blob master app assets javascripts i18n filtered js erb#l17   but this doesn't help for me because we use only the  i18n js export  rake task  if i find some time i might add a spec that covers this  at the moment we use the non digests version of the files 
i don't change i18n placeholder  i think there is problem with " " character  could you check it again with my example 
i'm trying to achieve something more dynamic than "reload the whole page" after a language switch
here https   github com fnando i18n js blob master lib i18n js engine rb#l30
i don't  i tried specifying  but that doesn't help
sorry  i no longer have access to the codebase where this occurred  feel free to close this if you can not replicate 
it returns  missing "en mainapp home title" translation  when i use i18n t 'mainapp home title'   when i log i18n translations  it looks like this   it seems to be because it searches for a 'mainapp home title' key in the 'en' locale  i know i can keep all my translations in one file  and then doing the namespaces here  by wrapping each section in an object with a key  i'd love to keep the translation files seperated though  if that is possible 
i am using rh6 and testing in irb  tested in ruby version 1 8 7  1 9 2 and 2 0 all failed  but can connect successfully using pure ssh at shell  so both devices can connect successfully using ssh at shell  but when using net  ssh  the second one failed on polling message and timeout
 mikecmpbll   my workaround   you don't need to call loop yourself  channel#wait will loop until the channel is closed 
aha  that page links to https   bugzilla mindrot org show_bug cgi id 1340 which in turn at the bottom links to http   tools ietf org id draft kanno secsh camellia 01 txt and searching the ietf website finally leads to a slightly newer version of that draft  https   tools ietf org html draft kanno secsh camellia 02 the newer draft has no actual content changes  and it also expired on august 1  2011    on a technical level  this looks like somebody copy   pasted parts of the aes cipher specs  and replaced "aes" by "camellia" resp  "aes" by "camellia"        not that this is necessarily a bad thing  mind you  still  i wonder what happened    various other camellia based rfc made it to standards track  but this one just died  ah well
yep  here you go 
that's great  but does that work for remote unix sockets  like   ssh  r var run mysql sock  var run mysql sock  which openssl 6 7+ supports

ah  actually i use the  autodoxygenfile  directive instead of  doxygenfile   i tried adding more specific paths in the  autodoxygenfile  directive but i have to check more seriously if this works at all  just to confirm  i need to have  xml  files generated before hand to use the  doxygenfile  directive  right  the thing is that i would like to avoid versioning  xml  files in my repository  in case that helps you to better understand my case  i generated the reference documentation  1  by using jinja2 based templates  https   github com do cv do cv tree master doc ref_doc_templates  2  i run this  hacky  script here  https   github com do cv do cv blob master doc ref_doc_generation py

hi  michaeljones   it is definitely a macro  i'm not entirely sure i want to see any output for it   hence my current solution to hide it from doxygen in the first place   however  i don't expect it to crash sphinx breathe if doxygen handles it just fine 
thanks for the quick feedback  yes  stupid me   master  aka tag  v4 5 0  fixes it  thanks     i was lazily using  pip   pypi  for install  which ships 4 4 apparently
still failing   other github repos work 
oops  sorry for the duplicate and thanks for the work on sphinx 2 0 support  strange that gihub "related issues" did not catch this obvious duplicate  really beta feature

you're correct  i found it myself in parallel  as a newbie to erlang  i did not realise that a module name is an atom actually and  hence  it must be written quoted when it contains a dash  thanks anyway

it doesn't complain about lost+found but it still shows the following message  i'm not sure if it's related or completely separate  argument "null" isn't numeric in numeric gt     at   mysqltuner pl line 1631  #1   w numeric  the indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a numeric value instead  if you're fortunate the message will identify which operator was so unfortunate  argument "null" isn't numeric in addition  +  at   mysqltuner pl line 1624  #1

i wish it was that simple  it actually has a three level file structure  but i already made my code to set everything up for pnguqant to work as is  it still managed to save about 20  of io runtime with the   output change  so thank you for that the only reason why i try to suggest is that imagemagick doesn't seem to worry about this  so maybe there is already some c code out there that handles this type of operation nicely 
ehm  true  that is an issue

thanks  the first case is indeed fixed at head  the second case should be fixed by the pull request i proposed in #257 
i understand what you said about git  although i didn't know that   but i still couldn't get dulwich to work with python 3 so i downgraded to python 2 temporarily tomorrow  i will have time to look into why it didn't work with encoded path tonight 
updated to 0 18 6 and this was fixed 
 benel how do i fix it then  any suggestions 
i'm on an other pc for the weekend  i will give you the anwser monday    
good question  i assume the "origin" header would need to be added to the white list in "content js restclient headers js" for restclient to recognize it 
if i have the time to dig into how the maven api and the plugin itself works i might do it  i fear that wouldn't be soon though 
for example when setting it debuggable false when doing a release profile  or using a build number passed in as an argument from a ci server 
gladly  it's going to be around next weekend 
nope  msvc fix applies only at c build  where no __cplusplus  reason is next  msvc has c89 which don't know about 'inline' directive    so c project simply fails to build  my usage case    building jansson as c static lib and linking to c++ binary and to c dynamic lib    so it's mixing  which means necessity using appropriate header files in both cases  so change lines to complement it

sort of work related  and also school related  will possibly be doing reviews of eviction policies based on real world data  also interested in contributing  any pointers help to get me going on looking into possibilities 
i'm running them now  i just found out the replacement i adapted was not correct  by the way  you might want to have the unit test checking the interval query result against the result from a linear scan   but it surely was faster on remove  this remove is slow because it does not take advantage of the binary search to find the interval to remove  and does a full tree scan in recursivesearch    my version defined a full order  compare interval pointer values if keys are equal   so i could get to the node faster 
exactly  it just terminates with that exit code
yes you are right  my understanding about pause frames is the same as yours  anyway cisco's version  pfc   which came up as a solution to the issues in pause  is "heavily" used  basically it uses traffic classes to selectively pause individual flows as opposed to the whole link as in plain old pause  even in my work i am doing pfc atop pause as i just use one priority class  specially in datacenter networks pfc is essential to make the network lossless  this equally applies to rdma based networks as well as the ones that use datacenter bridging  having said that  pfc has it's own issues like congestion spreading  deadlocks  etc so there are research efforts looking into making networks lossless without using pfc but i doubt pfc will die very soon  so it's something definitely worth having in inet  these are a couple things you may need to think of in terms of implementing pfc in inet  1  pfc is triggered based on queue depth on ingress queues  but in inet there is no notion of ingress queue as far as i know  at least in the version i use  3 6 4   2  the current pause implementation in inet assumes the pause frames are triggered by a layer above llc but the queue actually sits on the nic  i think pfc should be triggered by llc on it's own  i am not quite sure what the rfc says though  thanks  danushka on fri  oct 5  2018 at 8 36 am andras varga  notifications github com  wrote

it depends on how you have your cake installation setup  i assume because as a plugin and having it setup in production mode will mean it will be firing requests to yourapp com debug_kit  there might be another way around this but i couldn't find documentation about it   this works at least 
cakephp 2 4 5 and for the d bug kit it the version i just download from github
i'm using firefox 25 and crome is chrome 28 on xp  also the same thing happens with my colleagues too  is it some problem with debug kit or in the server  in my laptop though it works fine in both chrome as well as aurora 
thanks for answering    i was using this code ini_set "memory_limit"  1   but neither this helps me   i don't know what i'm doing wrong   can you please teach me how i conffigure the beste way possible my cakephp debug_kit please¿¿
yes  i did  i only update my app with composer and the error has appeared magically    for more info  the versions that i'm using in the app    cakephp 2 5 3   debug_kit 2 2 4

there was nothing in the apache  php fpm or cake logs  but i did find an error in firebug console that showed the framing attempt had been denied  went looking in the apache config and found that someone in app security set header always append x frame options deny  i've changed it to samesource and the toolbar shows fine now

i regenerated and reran the tests  only one failing test this time   but  i'm using bash 3 2 on mac os x yosemite  so that's probably not an issue  you're right though  we were using glob incorrectly with  sync true   i guess we didn't notice before because that usage was still functioning correctly in 4 0 6  that typeerror will be useful in the future  thanks for adding that and looking into this 
ah mess  i meant to post this under a different project   x this has nothing to do with node glob  i accidentally posted here because the example parameter has glob in it   3 to answer your question  it's an arbitrary parameter that's poorly named  a better example would have been   no colors to indicate not inserting terminal color characters  instead of no colors true  it comes as colors  false  which is fine  but just unexpected  i believe i meant to post this to substack's minimist  sorry for the bother

no   i use  threadedserver  in my working code   but there is a bug  so i try to simply check if std python has the same issue   i made simple one thread server and client which makes 10000 sequenced connections  i will check tomorrow with the trunk version 
i believe i was  probably shouldn't have mentioned the pipe class  basically  i removed all sleeps i could find in the code that might be contributing to the problem  and the only other one i could find that wasn't in an exception or had a delay that matched what i was observing was in the pipe class  i'm starting the server as  serviceobj   threadedserver myservice  port myport  protocol_config  "allow_public_attrs"   true   serviceobj start   on the client  conn   rpyc connect "localhost"  myport  bgsrv   rpyc bgservingthread conn  #sleep removed the client obtains a reference to an object on the server with a method that accepts a callback  i register a very simple method and when the callback is invoked on the server it takes approximately  1 seconds to return every time  i'm on rpyc 3 2

good morning  yes   i can give a bit more background here  first the stacktraces   and after that points its just a few million requests   per hour to the modules only available in the ida python environment  this worked and still works if using python instead of pypy for the client side with rpyc  so basically  from my understanding the only thing that changed is the frequency of remote module calls  by a multiple of a few thousand invokes more per minute  the gc process on server side shouldn't be affected since the server environment remained unaffected by the switch to pypy  i'm still doing more testing on this problem   but if you have some idea  that would be great    as for now  i worked arround my problem by catching eoferror exception  terminating anything ida related  restarting the server and resuming the execution  still gives me an approx 2000  speedup compared to running analysis with python instead of pypy 
sounds related indeed  though the serve_threaded function isn't involved in the race identified here  except for calling serve     i haven't tested the new version yet  but the relevant code is unchanged    asyncresult wait   connection serve basically  the asyncresult needs to check  is_ready  while holding the  recv_lock  and the dispatch needs to set  is_ready  before releasing it  or there needs to be some other similar sync mechanism 
yeah  i'm not sure what to do exactly  it might be good if you could mark that part of the scope for later undoing  but having looked at the rails source it seems like it wouldn't be a fun thing to implement  you could unscope it  but then you'd get rid of any default_scopes as well as any other scoping that's part of the chain  for the moment i've created a test to cover this situation  https   github com cheerfulstoic ancestry commit e30a4cee6796cde1ea1b324951a83b3d9cef5173 i'll open a ticket on the rails github page and see if they have any brilliant ideas 
looks like children any  uses a count    query instead of selecting the first child  ideally you could do something like this   then you would just have 2 queries  one for the original query and one to fetch children instead of n+1 queries 
thanks  superclarkk  kind of sort of but not really  what i really need is to refresh a subset not all open  just a few quick tabs so to speak  because refreshing 80 or more tabs at once would not make my computer happy i don't think  she cries under the load of fat assed chrome as it is  bloated memory leaking sieve that it is     i do not need to further kick her while she's down    the other thing is they're not necessarily grouped in a same window  more typically they'll just be the same domain sub domain  i looked at the linked and some similar extensions  none quite tick all the boxes for me  plus  i think it's a great functional fit for qt and something that will attractive to that specific set of users who like me have tons of tabs and frequently get timed out of one site or another 
an example from my project  we support that a user can use functions to evaluate values in documents  there are about a dozen of different functions  which can be used in over 20 different places  no we have 12x20 specs for this  with examples we could melt the specs down to 20 specs each with 12 examples  the different functions   typical cases from the literature are    examples for calculating parking lot pricing  5min    x  15min  x  20min    y          example for discount calculations examples help communication with non technical people  too

that would be ok  the whole point is of tiny mode is to remove those assumptions and allow code to be packed tightly across the whole 32k area  including the 16k boundary  a 32k rom is not supposed to use bank switching anyway  if you want those assumptions to hold  the correct solution is to use the standard mode  only allowing sections placed in bank 1 to be aliased was meant to be a conservative implementation  and is not strictly necessary  rgbds originally did not have that restriction  and to be clear  in either case  romx sections without an explicit bank declaration should always be allowed  one little winkle is  what should  bank    return  in my opinion  again  to be conservative  is that maybe it should actually always return 1  reasoning  if there is code for bank switched calls  which there shouldn't be  but if there is  a value of 1 would give the smallest likelyhood of crashing the code if it runs on a cartridge with a mbc of some kind  writing 1 to   2000  will then select the bank that should have been permanently selected anyway 
i think that a separate repo containing the files for the build would be better  so i won't fill the commit history with tests and debian rules files  ideally  i could use a separate branch too 
crud actions work through the interface  and rspec is able to do transactions on the tables and truncates with database_cleaner 
not more than this  sorry 
here you are 
the #sconf yaws and #gconf yaws are empty  see the yaws make_server_header 0 function 
i'll try a newer version and post the results  on jan 29  2012  at 1 00 pm  steve vinoski wrote 
to make this a configurable option is fine  and it can be better if this config can be made during compile time  that way we can determine its role during make and don't introduce run time cost  do you think this change would be carried out in the near future  another question  can we separate yaws into several components that can be configured during compile time to determine what kind of web server it is ought to be  our website  https   qyapp com is using yaws as the back end server  the front end is a web ide that runs in the browser and talks to the server for all kinds of operations  the ui part is almost solely done via javascript  thus we don't rely on yaws dynamic content to generate html  if we can separate out components from a single yaws_server erl and can config during compile time which components to include in the final server  that will not only improve the code readability but also improve the run time performance  do you think that is doable or desirable 
thanks steve  i use a makefile target thus   where  rebar2  is in the parent directory to the cloned repo  the attached diff fixes it for me  by checking the  os type    in  rebar config script   i don't use rebar normally  perhaps i should be using rebar3 for yaws   yaws_diff txt  https   github com klacke yaws files 2865309 yaws_diff txt 
yes  i can  i plan to just add four individual  db_index true  to the data model  it would also be possible to use a composite index over all four of them but i think it's to restrictive in case someone like's to filter by only one of those fields  what do you think

select character_value from information_schema sql_implementation_info where implementation_info_name 'dbms version' returns "08 01 0009" you tell me which file to look at and i will see if i can cobble together a prototype patch that you can comment on

restarting yaxim did not help  but switching to another wifi t although threema and k9 mail were able to access the net while yaxim was complaining 
it's interesting  i cannot reproduce it when i'm reading it from a locally saved file  but it reproduces every time when i get it from network  i'll investigate this more and report back  i'll also try git bisect in order to find which commit changed the behavior

 indutny i'm not sure that any action is required  just saying that if there are users who need a http parser that is header only  there is now a solution  and also this is my way of saying thanks to the people who developed nodejs http parser  without which my implementation would not be possible 
 gottesmm can add more detail here  but the contribution guidelines for swift appear to require apache2  https   github com apple swift blob master contributing md

i thought it was just one feed but it turns out it's for all feeds now  very weird  i wasn't using the latest github version of feedzirra so i updated my site to rails 3 1 0 r5  updated feedzirra and still the same issue  on my personal blog's feed www stevenshelby com feed i get the following errors when i do a feedzirra  feed fetch_and_parse   date can't be parsed   sun  29 may 2011 00 03 18 +0000  date can't be parsed   wed  29 dec 2010 20 45 01 +0000  date can't be parsed   mon  06 dec 2010 15 15 41 +0000  date can't be parsed   sun  05 dec 2010 16 34 55 +0000  date can't be parsed   sat  04 dec 2010 19 38 11 +0000  date can't be parsed   sat  04 dec 2010 17 32 46 +0000  date can't be parsed   mon  15 nov 2010 17 03 02 +0000  date can't be parsed   sat  13 nov 2010 16 27 07 +0000  date can't be parsed   mon  18 oct 2010 16 06 12 +0000  date can't be parsed   wed  06 oct 2010 14 42 15 +0000  this happens with another blog's feed as well 
i'm using feedjira v1 3 1 in a rails project  rails v 4 0 1  with ruby 2 0 0p0  looks like it's rails that's adding the to_json method  i didn't realize it auto added it  your map idea will probably work just fine—i'll try it out when i have the chance  it'd be nice to have that built in  i'm using to_json to return the result via javascript  once i've included feedjira in the gemfile i open up  rails console   using your example xml file 
 amatriain here one gist of an example of a ghost blog  https   gist github com bdubaut 8000ed960c5a0f05114f i couldn't find any ghost blog doing so  and after discussing with them on twitter  they said it's an error on their side  i did the same thing with my wordpress blog  www careforadrink com  and i have the same result  hence me proposing to find an image from the entry if the feed does not include one

hi nathan  i'm using an arduino mega and the characters are sent by running serial3 println "append file txt"   serial3 println "bla"   serial3 write 26      have tried with one  two and three of these as configured in the config file  the result is one  two and three escape characters printed in file txt and then closing append mode  i have a "while serial3 available  " loop that checks for " " or " " so i can determine if the append mode is closed 
oops  didn't see there was a new version  sorry 
the same as grepl    return true if the string is a character  or even always true  
is that standard practice though  a package could have no dependencies and rely on the user to respond to "there is no package called ‘x’" for everything  in this case the user actually gets "there is no package called ‘htmltools’" since that's the first missing dependency  after installing that  they  then  get "there is no package called ‘htmlwidgets’" too  a book specific package is probably what i'll do to ensure version consistency in any case  but i would think a  if  requirenamespace     check in  stringr  would be welcome  a mention of this in the docs for  str_view   and where it's used  might be a good idea 
actually  yes   would be fine by me

wow thx for your quick responses  ingwiephoenix  i can't really use javascript at all  could you show me how to do this please 
at the risk of sounding naïve  i've never done any sql editing  would anyone be able to offer some guidance in this endeavor 
thanks for replying so quickly  the test file is available at http   www ebi ac uk efo efo owl i don't think a subset of it will cause the problem  but i will try tomorrow with a file of a similar size to check it's not just something odd with this file  both each_statement and graph predicates graph objects don't include the class either sadly 
that was indeed the issue  after formatting to fat32 i can now select the disk  thanks
i use ouf d3orbs  rothui   with complete fresh config  as i know  in some other ufs it's possible to change the distance to the head 
i'm already working around this with postupdate  just reporting here because it seems odd to use statusbars and then hide them instead of just relying on the value  maybe it does make sense and i'm just missing something  though 
i am using the ouf_simple ui code  no castbar channeling   true ouf_simple core functions lua   r  https   user images githubusercontent com 36516072 66283246 5c056600 e8f5 11e9 8cfa 9908547b5584 gif  i did another experiment just now  it's not related to spark    gif  https   user images githubusercontent com 36516072 66283709 19dd2400 e8f7 11e9 9f68 86d684f49c58 gif  the cause of the error is that the last casting is channeling  and this will happen later 
when i use latest version of easyxdm js file  it is working fine 
hi  the issue can be seen on this demo http   consumer easyxdm net current example upload html if you look at in safari 5 on the mac  make sur that your status bar is visible at the bottom and you'll see that it hangs on x 1 of x resources loaded  i have tracked down the issue to the testfornamepropertybug    function  the problem is that safari sees sourceless iframe and tries to load about blank as resource  this load never finishes and thus it hangs forever  stupid  not sure how you'd want to fix this  i will just throw in a check for safari and not run the routine in that case  safari doesn't have the name issue  so it shouldn' t need the check 
nevermind i was wrong when speaking of context   i'm working with cookies and communicating using easyxdm  and facing the following issue   http   stackoverflow com questions 98127 accessing domain cookies within an iframe on internet explorer unfortunately the p3p header inclusion  as suggested in the above link  is not solving this in my case  sorry for misinterpreting my bug

hi herxox  in fact is just a cosmetic issue  the data is correct but maybe as a matter of convention you did not include the code for other countries so maybe the se yaml file could follow the same convention as others  it currently looks like  ab  name  "stockholms län  se 01 " names  "stockholms län  se 01 " and should probably be  ab  name  "stockholms län" names  "stockholms län" as is the case for other countries like fr  de  us

no i cannot set environment name off  because some scripts should not run on the production environment  is there a way to run environment scripts with more options  for example  running all script except production environment  
i don't know of a _good_ reason to start a script with  go   but we had one that caused unexpected behavior so   maybe  for the record this is against sql server  any particulars about how its batch splitting works  i'm also seeing some weirdness in a large set of test data inserts that have  go s placed every few hundred lines to make smaller batches

so i was using the hosted zip file and not github  this morning i blew the vm away and reinstalled ubuntu from media and updated  and attempted the install from scratch again  it errors in the same place  for an experiment i muted the line in  requirements txt  that was causing the problem and re ran  pip install  r requirements txt  and it completed without any other issues  however   python setup py develop  still does not complete successfully  any other ideas  should i try a different distro 
no  ubuntu  that may be caused by this  execv is forced since 3 0 24  so billiard starts a complitely new interpreter for worker  when i set to force_execv   false i cannot reproduce the bad behaviour 
compctl is a zsh builtin  so bash doesn't find it    compctl  bash  compctl  command not found   echo    127 i am guessing that bash is failing  because it wants good bash syntax  when it tries to parse the false if block  after it executes the first compctl   even though it doesn't intend to run the block  if you don't have an old bash  can you try changing it so it's a syntax error for new bash  like  precmd_functions++  _z_precmd  and try running that in a new bash  that fails in my recent linux bash  4 2 25 1  release  even though it's in the zsh side of the "if compctl"

sure  on the server side it is httpd 2 4 with mod_buffer and mod_reflector  the script sends data until the web server starts to send back the response  from that point on it only reads  no lnger writes  the problem happens with and without the expect header  if you can not reproduce  you might want to increase the multiplicator 200000  you might need to adjust ip port localhost 8080 to your setup

 phillbaker yes on rails and use of  track     will look at the math when i have a chance  i realize  conversions  is not used for conversion_rate  for the particular click experiment i'm running  it's not important to know how many times the user converted  merely that they converted  and the infrastructure is sufficient to answer that question  were i to want to answer the question "how many times did the user click "   right now  i'd just have to divide  conversions  by two  but that's a smell  indeed  ab_add_conversion  sets count   1  but it seems to be getting called twice from what i see of sql queries in the log 
i figured it out  replaced the highlighted lines with  values   record vanity_metric_values select "sum # connection quote_column_name 'value'    as value  # connection quote_column_name 'date'  "  where  connection quote_column_name 'date'  + ' between   and  '  from to_date  to to_date   group "# connection quote_column_name 'date'  "  now it works 
i have just tested the code   and it throws  argumenterror  wrong number if arguments  given 0  expected 1  2   and worse  with this pattern  rails doesn't show the exact line where this exception is thrown  so  i will stick to  vanity track   metric  
it seems to me there are three approaches  i don't properly know python  so not sure if all three are achievable in the language  _1  more functions_ simply add in new functions  this is perhaps the least attractive  since you'd basically nearly double the size of the api  i e    i think the subclass idea seems the nicest to me  haven't thought it through completely if there are any issues with it

 tubbo thank you for looking into this quickly  i was able to get what i needed with  actiondispatch  session  redisstore   so thank you very much  i'm surprised i didn't run into that with my research before i started down the path of  abstractstore   the master branch is updated with what i was trying to do  just override and provide simpler and controlled options to all micro services utilizing my gem  keeping them similar

yes  absolutely  the only question  it seems  is if you consider the if else pairing more common  or the standalone if not  since allowing nesting of the     list    block inside the    #list  …   list    sequence is less verbose if you expect if else pairings to be much more common than standalone if not blocks  i don't much care  though  to clarify your description of the new tag type  however  what is the behavior when the enumerable or tag are _not present_  rather than present but false or empty  i trust those remain equivalent

i just wanted to draw your attention to the issue  as for the tests  there is something else  what if a particular tool   framework is not istalled  the tests in their current form will fail  they should not  if a tool is not present then tests should skip their checks

 andrewherron imagine parsing thousands of entries from a file too big to keep in memory  parallel will internally convert any range and enumerables to arrays  so it can't be used 
its literally as simple as   seems to work on dev  but throws this exception in unit tests  bizarre  i know 
 bhelx for sure  here is the success i had yesterday  https   gist github com patcoll c6e77092cab60de7a14e17a5f9ca7b55 the following is the documentation for the rest api that contains options for  starts_at  and  trial_ends_at   https   dev recurly com docs create subscription recurly doesn't allow trials without entering payment info  so we are currently making that happen on our end  once the user decides to pay for an account  we need to be able to back date the trial to start and end on specific dates  the rest api call i made above successfully made a trial that ends on the date we specified  the most important part for us is that the  trial_ends_at  ends up being correct  is this scenario supported by the ruby recurly library 
yes thanks  it fix it
it usually is new  created with   and then we start to fill account_acquisition 
we are still experiencing the issue occasionally  i haven't been able to figure out any pattern for failures either 
thnx for your help  i have done it there was a permission issue in linkedin 
i am not exactly sure of it because the same piece of code throws both the errors  also  whenever we are write to db  update insert  we get some output back which is read by the underlying modules  are you talking about this read operations or only  select  operations 
codersquid    both dev and production using postgres 9 1 11 unfortunately  i don't have a good trace  brad    thanks for looking into this  i will be watching my production server  and my dev system  for any further problems related to this  i did some south migrations on my dev and production server today without any problems 
you are right  rpkilby my initial issue was not precise enough to work with  sorry for that  in my case  a developer trusted too much the jsonfield 2 x and passed sometimes strings instead of a dict  the following code works with the permissive 2 1 1 version but breaks in 3 0 0  i'll have a look to the whole codebase but do you confirm that the old behaviour was not desired  
i can not   it's between versions   there is no way to create a pr to demonstrate this  create this with jsonfield2
thanks when i run  pg_config   pgxs  it tells me  you need to install postgresql server dev x y for building a server side extension or libpq dev for building a client side application   i was running this as part of the build  which must be working with postgres 9 6 4  but doesn't work with 9 6 5 and 9 6 6  apt get installl  y postgresql server dev all i think that must be the problem  thanks for pointing me in the right direction with pg_config 
the old lib plugins discussion version indicates it is 2009 08 22  edit  which doesn't seem to be the best way to check for the version  because the version file in the updated plugin also has the same date  the "info" button on the plugin management page indicates that the plugin has been installed fri  08 oct 2010  and this is the first time for me to update the plugin  so i guess whatever version has been around at that time is what has been installed  edit2  it appears to me that the threads that have disappeared from the page are those that have identical timestamps with other threads 
yes  the standard toolbar in edit mode works fine  i'm using the latest dw version  rc2013 03 06  and latest versions of 'discussion' and 'mp3play' 
oh yes  so sorry  i forgot to add this information dokuwiki version  release 2013 12 08 "binky" php version 5 5 7 2 it is a wiki farm on debian server   it remind me that it would be good to update my version    v_v  
the environment is ubuntu linux  and vimproc has been compiled  recompiled by hand in addition to the automatic compilation by the recipe  minimal config to reproduce is  the error occurs on startup
thank you very much  i have read   all   the documentation before trying to compile and   always   used the compile commands as described  the 32bit dll fails at linking stage no matter which "tool command prompt" i used  they are regular cmd prompts with added different env  variables  there are several for vs  2 native and 2 cross comp  i know you suggest using mingw64  i just wanted to build with microsoft compiler  since in my experience it produces faster binaries  but i suppose in our case there will not be any difference in speed   anyway  thanks for updating 
ohh i see  thank's for your response  pre built is compiled files with many improvement in optimization  i don't need to compile it after i put it in correct path 
i guess this project is a bit on the backburner  so my suggestion is to push forward    fork the project   make changes to the api until you feel something is coming along nicely   report back here when you want people to test it out and provide feedback  remember they should only need to do  npm install thomasankcorn exif js  to install it directly from your github  master  branch if you set up the project correctly    once the kinks have ironed out i would then supply a pr if the pr just ends up rotting without progress  just publish an npm artifact under your own npm namespace  npm install  thomasankorn exif js  as a reasonable compromise 
no it doesn't  the problem is the ld_library_path which is not set to the correct arch dir and therefore shared libraries cannot be found installed in the arch folder during runtime 
from the dfki compiler speedup package set  you can allow autoproj to download and configure ccache and icecc to provide distributed compiling  this selection is realised as an add_build_system_dependency using command line option when bootstrapping 
yes  of course  i can just glob the directory and render each file in turn   that's what i am doing now but without using tilt  when i read about the register feature it just occurred to me that it might be nice if i could just register the glob and be done with it  but its not a big deal   just a nicety  maybe something to put at the bottom of the todo list 
i applied the patch and tried to build the package 5 times and always successful  so it seems that this patch fixes the issue 
hint hint      i've since started using sass  dues to efforts made by the spree team  so i guess i'm out 
hi edouard  it didn't fix it for me  i still have the same error  it seems to be particular to this machine  as i setup and installed on another and it worked fine  i'll do some digging when i've got time and see if i can work out what's happening  thanks paul
ok  will do thanks

hi  i wanted to use where clause  but i don't fully understand how the scope of where clause works  here is one of my attempts   this is mysterious to me  it seems to me sometimes where works  but not always  my observation is when it's structural recursion it will work  i suppose well founded recursion is not fully supported yet  i discovered a workaround for the problem i encountered in this issue  but it would be nice if you can show me how you would do it in equations 
the same thing happens when  leafnosubterm  is an assert  it was originally an assert that i hoisted out of the  next obligation    however copy pasting the definition of  freef_directsubterm  and  freef_subterm  given by the derive clause allow me to prove "by hand" that  freef_subterm  is well founded without trouble

hi  i've set up a small test  https   github com michaelrigart responder_test just clone the the test en run db migrate   run the server and go directly to the  posts resource   create test post  to simulate my error  i've overwritten the destroy model method to return false  you will notice that when you now try to destroy the object  you will get redirected back to the index  that is thanks to the location option i've set in the controller  otherwise i would get redirected to the show action  the only thing that doesn't seem right  is the fact that i get the notice flash instead of the alert   hope this helps

this solves the problem i was seeing  thanks   
you're correct  i forgot about updates  since persisted  won't work for updates and this gem expects save to be called in the controller  are there another alternatives

https   www atmcash com bug  the issue occurs in ff 3 6 and ie8  didn't test in any other browsers  we narrowed the issue down to the duplicates  whenever there is a script that is being attempted to load twice it freaks out  if we set the allowduplicates to true  or get rid of the  wait   it works  thanks in advance 
currently i load mootools core and labjs via standard script tag  then the additional js like mootools more  clientcide and my own modules  so the domready occurs before my own modules are loaded via script tag  so with the instance   chain i can make sure that my modules are loaded before i try to use it in inline code  otherwise it can happen that js don't know the module   class cause its not loaded yet  at least i would wish there was a  completed   function which  similar to wait  but fires parallel 
it vary rare error   i can reproduce it only on one host  maybe slow  and in 1 per 10 page loading  i thinks it is not bug  thanks

i simply followed the instructions in vim dispatch help   let g nremap   ''  and the vim dispatch mappings were gone  it was only a little later that i noticed the 'vim unimpaired' mappings were also gone  i don't use vim dispatch directly  but i keep it around for vim fugitive  as of about three weeks ago  it added a normal mode mapping for 'd' and movements  like space and enter  which i happen to use  for now i've forked vim dispatch and added a 'g dispatch_default_mappings' option which will disable all mappings without messing with 'g nremap'

sure  no big deal  looking forward to the fix   
some perl modules have to install dependencies  to confirm those installations  a question is asked to the user  something similar to  "do you want to install this dependency  1  yes 2  yes to all 3  no 4  no to all" we couldn't make the script answer automatically in situations like that 
i have found the file you mentioned  i have removed the file  it starts to index and when it's busy it gives the lock error again  when it's almost done  it also says it can't open data access log  a file from the logstats plugin   right after that  it gives the error that tagindexer is locked  edit  it seems an incompatability when the plugin searchstats is installed as well  i have disabled that plugin and the indexing went fine now

yeah  very strange indeed–it's actually a little more erratic than i had originally thought  i now can't get it to happen all the time  still happening every now and again though  i'll post the full output the next time it happens 
oh  i wouldn't call this change "support"  it just so happens to let me use loofah in an unsupported way  all the existing tests pass with it  here's the actual commit  since i failed at github flavored markdown   http   github com mrkurt loofah commit a336a9cdcc4ca14d9e02c8576a7474ae92ebc4ab i am working on real mm support in loofah though  once it's to an intelligent state in my current project  i plan to extract it and submit it with tests and whatnot 
yeah  you're totally reasonable and i had a feeling this was a big change  removing nokogiri as a rails dependency is on my wish list but i guess i'll have to ask santa this year 
 flavorjones yes  i want to get rid of this   #13   tag as well as from html tags  kinda combination of  to_text  and not  to_s   results expected      " ntest n nte3st  r n"  or even better if i will have new line only for closing tags like    p   which situated near openin tags like   p         "test nte3st  r" 
for example if you visit this url https   www imdb com title tt4456850  descrition of this movie is "two teen rival babysitters  jenny and lola  team up to hunt down one of their kids who accidentally runs away into the big city without any supervision " but getplot   and gettagline   returning "n a"  fabianbeiner

well  simonsapin recommended using tinycss  he didn't seem to approve of using regex to parse css  he linked me to  this  http   stackoverflow com questions 1732348 regex match open tags except xhtml self contained tags 1732454#1732454  and said it applies to css as well  i was thinking it'd be good just to ignore the   import  so that it doesn't break cssselect  but if you want to take on the challenge of importing it  that could be neat  i'm not sure if you'd be able to inline an   font face  definition though

we can see this behavior on your own demo page  if we delete one of the anchors  let's say we delete p4  if we go to the bottom of the page and use the link to p4 then we will get a scroll to top  thanks 
here's link atm it works  not using your code using the below code  but you'll see first click on the links blow the page header scroll to the correct position but if you click the link again when not at the top it changes position

it seems much more intuitive to me to run the block item by item  as for a realistic example  i encountered this issue while trying to use the highline menu system to filter an error log  i'm building a database from a bunch of csv files and some of the data is rejected during the build process  this goes into a big json file where each entry includes  among other data  the name of the file that generated the error and the type of error  i need to provide subsets of these build errors on demand to coworkers  so i was trying to build a little command line utility that would let me select an arbitrary set of files followed by an arbitrary set of error types  and output the error log after being filtered by these selections  i was originally trying to use the string regex form of  gather  to terminate the menu by entering a blank  after selecting all desired options  i can imagine many similar use cases  but perhaps there are better ways to approach such a problem 
hey  abinoam yes that is what i reverted to  i was using version  highline  1 6 21   mac osx yosemite
so bosh_cli's gemspec claims a dependency on highline     1 6 2  for reasons i haven't dug into  but if i modify that  the latest git repo at least gets past the error  thanks 
thanks  you can download my test here  https   www dropbox com s 32ozcfc5q11e4uu minimplayer_3 zip dl 0 when you pressed 'a'  's'  'd' you will hear three different tones  i tried to add  setvolume   before  play   and then it says "volume is not supported" 
actually most files should've been 44100hz as that's what i wanted to target  i have no clue why the output chose 22050hz as default  or mabye fileplayer assumed it to be 22050hz for some reason   i agree with you on the ticked twice part  that's obvious  but say we're about to sample a sine wave  then ticking twice gives us two data points  unfortunately  we can only proceed with one  why would you arbitrarly choose the second one  wouldn't interpolation imply the average of both samples  i have to create a minimum viable test case as i'm having issues on multiple fronts but since i have a rather complex setup  a live input  two ouputs  many samples  multiple gains   i have to see individually where the problem is

 eregon getting a bit ahead of things  i'll check  but it will be a bit  i've got a mswin build from  unak   mswin build  https   github com unak mswin build   i'll check with that  i suspect both work  on windows  i believe  symlink   and  real   work fine  the issue is creating symlinks  although i haven't checked all types  on windows  creating some types of symlinks require elevated privileges  which are enforced on most user systems  but can be disabled on servers  so  i don't think there's anyway to test  symlink   and  real    since there's no way for the test system to create a symlink  hence  i think using  __file__  is fine  but a temp file would be easier  since we'd know that  real   would be equal to the regular name 
 valo this is great news  active development is always a good thing to have  i think we should partner somehow  in hackbulgaria  we will benefit a lot from such a system  there is also an algo course coming up and we plan to make it really good   big    i have 2 more questions      how many active contributors you have right now    why don't you support python 3 4  3    rather than python 2 7  python 2 must and should die    also  there are few things that i think we can do      since we need such a system  we can invest in contributors to keep working on that system  or provide our own people helping here  does this sound viable    i think we need to run our own instance of the maycamp arena since we have our own infrastructure of courses   students  but keeping all the problems in one place can also be a good thing  what is your opinion here  about new features  without giving enough time for my thoughts to form something clear  here are few suggestions    make it possible to login with external api   import extrnal database with users  this is for our case    make it possible to export back information about problems to that external database    migrate from python 2 to python 3 for problems    add few more languages like haskell   javascript  node     remove the pdf problems description    sync problem descriptions from a github repository  want to make a new contest  great  say which folder in which github repo holds the proble statements  in a given format    import them to database    make it possible to test discrete parts of code  like functions  running with tests   without the need to implement an entire program    re style the entire thing    add more hierarchy to contests  such as   contests are happening in a course  each course can have tags which serves as filtering  but as i said   i just drafted them by exploring the system   looking for what our needs are  i will be happy if you provide some input on my questiosn above  i will be extremely happy if we can find a way to collaborate  _

sweet  that was it  thank you  i did have duplicate authorizations in the  twurlrc file  so i renamed it and reauthorized my user  that did the trick  i'll be sure to look at the readme txt more thoroughly next time 
it's to do with browser cache  if you watch in the network tab in chrome  the images in the fancybox example are being reloaded each time  whereas my images are being cached by the browser  as i'm serving them out of an app that sets cache headers  if i clear browser cache before i show the image again  the load event fires correctly  so it's actually quite hard to provide a test page as such  because this isn't just an html js issue  it's to do with cache headers 
'course it can  but since it completely breaks the functionality of iviewer  i thought it was more appropriate to force it off  arguably you could do the "position  absolute" above through css rules too    up to you though  but i'd suggest bunging it the docs as its really non obvious why it breaks

hi  mikiobraun i am fairly new to java  only a couple of months of experience   so i am not so sure but from what i have read all that is needed is to add a module info java file at the root of your project like below  however you may be right that this could break some backwards compatibility  i wish i could help more but truthfully i am just not that experienced with java  from what i understand  java 9+ have modules which give more explicit dependencies  but without a module info java file the module is implicitly defined based on the jar name  this can then cause issues if names change

in that case you shouldn't be able to put in a set at all  currently putting in a set of numbers or strings works fine  though you don't get back a set  this can be added     x # "s"    but this can't     x #  y     there's already lossy conversion with keyword values in a map  which come back as strings  as well as with keyword keys in a map  which only optionally come back as keywords   if for some reason your map has strings and keywords as keys  you're hosed  as far as i can tell

i will see if i can get that together  alas  hampered by the fact i'm a relative newbie   just to clarify  my model has something like this   code scope  archived  lambda    value true  where  archived    value      code  and my controller says   code has_scope  archived   type     boolean   code  but then  i can't use values in the query param like  tt  foo archived false  tt  because the  tt false  tt  value gets dropped  so  as a workaround i've monkeypatched as follows   boolify turns 't'  '1'  'true'  etc  params into true for passing to the model's scope

yes   this is what i want  any suggestions to make it down  发自我的 iphone
it's sample one and i have xcode version 6 4 
i am using mac os 10 6 6 and ruby 1 9 2p180  
only one  of the two that are on the server   the one where it doesn't work has much more files in it  about 850  while the other directory has only about 40 
there was an issue in the  upload    method above  so what basically the following happened   write_chunk_size   1024  is the total characters i send with each chunk  while  offset  is in bytes  therefore if a chunk contains any characters greater than 1 byte  it would be corrupted because  offset  increments by the number of characters  written  not the number of bytes written  an example   the solution was to force binary encoding for the content   write_content   content dup force_encoding 'binary'

hi  ledermann i just did a test  basically  if you just change the database adapter from  sqlite3  to  mysql2  under  spec_helper   and run  queries_spec rb   and it will give you the  indexerror  string not matched 
i was able to get the tests to pass  i _think_ the issue might be the html checkboxes  even though i have the values set as true and false  its possible it’s saving them as a string “true” and “false” in the database  im going to need to look to see about converting them when i receive the form  thanks  joshua lippiner   t 704 323 5661   e jlippiner noctivity com  mailto jlippiner noctivity com  on tuesday  april 22  2014 at 8 51 am  thomas kriechbaumer wrote

here's the complete sequence   i have thor version 0 15 2  i thought this might have been a zsh issue  but the same thing happens on bash 
it does but it would seem this report is a bit pre mature  i did not fully understand your stance on rvm which we are using for our server setup  i figured we could just use the global bundler to do the vendor install update on deploy  there seems to be an issue when running bundle in the naked system with out any rvm being loaded  i suppose that the script is hitting the same issue  it's running with out rvm being loaded and there for not finding the bundler gem  i think this might be an issue in our rvm setup preventing global gems being executed from the command line 
not sure but a  git push origin master  fixed that  i also had to recreate my post receive hook on the server  there appeared to be a checkout of the repository within the bare repository  in this case it was within the  home git frog git directory  on 05 12 2015 2 24 am  "mislav marohnić" notifications github com wrote

i got a  systemstackerror  in  builder_helper rb   i am not quite sure if that's in some way specific to my setup  though   the line in  01_empty_window rb  which is  i think  responsible for this is line 12   win   gtk  window new  toplevel    when running with  ruby  rdebug 01_empty_window rb  it stays there forever instead of the  systemstackerror   without ruby debug gem  though

ok  the version was the real problem   with the new version  0 6 3  everything went back to normal  closing issue  ps  sorry no time for test 
in our app this is happening in the unit test suite  specifically  while django is running migrations to prepare the db for the test suite  we also know it's specific to v2 0 since the same setup worked fine for us with the last version 
i can  but i was really hoping there would be a tool in this library to help facilitate it  especially in light of  send_html_mail  doing that  my current plan is to build my own solution in our app until i can use one from here  i'd rather use one from this library than roll my own  but if a pr to do this wouldn't get merged  then i won't have much choice

hello  yes i saw the script in #15  but i saw this script too late   in the moment when i finished my script and when i tried to find some way how to share with somebody      oh  yes this is answer to your question  i will very lucky if you give this code between examples  it can be more people than only me who can use that  when i tried your library pysrt  i found the library is not compatible with python version 2 5  i tried windows version   there is problem with codecs package  the codecs version 2 5 does not support utf32  but the constanst bom_utf32_le  bom_utf32_be are defined  the result is  there is not possible to compile srtfile py package  i solved it by replacing your code  codecs_boms   dict  codec  unicode bom  codec   for bom  codec in boms  by this code  codecs_boms   dict   i   0 while i   len boms   bom  codec   boms i  try  codecs_boms codec    unicode bom  codec  i +  1 except lookuperror  del boms i  then everything works almost right  the codecs from version 2 5 sometimes did not work properly  if you want interresst in it more  i send you two subtitle files  when i merge them with python25   the first a few lines from czech subtitles are damaged  i did not find why  you can see the right result run only with python 2 7  i tried python 2 6 from linux and everything was great too  only python 2 5 has problem  i have another one thing  which i do not much understand  the encoding used in codecs open  if you will run my script for above two subtiltes and you will use encoding "utf_8" everything is ok  but when you will use encoding utf 8 or utf8 you get error message  i thought utf_8  utf 8  utf8 are same encodings  but it is not true  thank you for your library and hope for time when you will read my email  bye martin 2 00 00 39 123     00

thanks  stefanocasazza i did this 
we got to the same conclusion  but how do you explain that the html generation above works fine   see  it's all about sticking to one md specification  just like the     issue we discussed last week  i am pretty sure digg uses the same conventions as github    the document should render properly     except for the  id  stuff which is a valid mistake 
hi  sorry for the late answer  i setup a new clean java project and it doesn't produce a parser error anymore  but strangely  it just replaces   with  gt  and doesn't process any markdown elements  so clearly  something went wrong  i used the latest 1 2 2 jar  is it possible to attach some code here  thomas
i will prepare a little test situation and send you a login for it  i will need to let you wait until the weekend however 
no  mit or ruby means the code is either completely mit or ruby licensed  as you can't relicense ruby code as mit  you are stuck with ruby  but then your code is ruby too if it doesn't work without the iconv rb  as i assume there is live without iconv rb in your code  "mit and ruby" is the only viable string 
my bad  i meant that it never worked  i do not see anything in log production log as well  this problem also occurs when i visit other instikis where i have permission to edit pages  not just ones i locally host 
seems like its working great now  thank you 
if no one else  i will probably make it at the weekend 
thanks   nrk  i was thinking something like that  or at least splitting the protocol code off from the client code into something platform agnostic  and then writing a luvit specific client  which i could definitely help with  
 travisjeffery sorry for not pointing what kind of examples are not working anymore  i mean those ones  https   github com jtrupiano rack rewrite#usage examples
oh  wow  yeah i totally didn't think this through  i'm just going to blame this one on the sleep deprivation    thanks   jjaderberg
oh ok  this is embarrassing  i just figured the problem is just exactly the same as described here  again by me   https   github com haskell opengl openglraw issues 25 a driver update solves the issue  for the record   if ghc hangs while linking gl libraries it is most likely a screwed up driver setup  strange libgl so overruling drivers library  sorry for the non issue   
  about make install  i don't know  this is log from compile  http   wklej org id 1654122  in line 21 you have _make_ what do optflags macro  in line 123 you have _make_install_ what do  make_install macro   when i installed bootchart hand   this also not have permission  but i checked folder in file manager and it have   so maybe when i installed hand "make install" copied permission from above command to this folder  but when i tried build package this folder not exist  from 146 to 166 line i see scripts  maybe this scripts removed this folder  but i don't know why    about debug option    i want log   for example in   tmp folder or  tmp how it working  i want see errors because i have problem with bootchart2 1  i have problem run this in my system pclinuxos 32bit from grub2 opensuse i see files in  lib bootchart tmpfs so it run   but i don't know why not working   scripts run in default for all rpm build  i can not remove it  2  i tested on virtualbox with pclinuxos  bootchart2 working with grub1 and grub2  from pclinuxos  but my colleague from forum have chart compressed to right http   postimg org image smwqdc0vr full    i don't remember this problem in virtualbox   but i'm not sure   he probably use grub2 from fedora and this is chart pclinuxos   
hey  mpeterv  i've just tried with cluacov and the same issue occurs 
oops  sorry  i was actually trying to do this   http   heydojo co cc ckeditor codemirror index html and it is my fault  i am trying to do too much  i use the latest snapshot of opera linux 10 70 from   http   my opera com desktopteam blog   10 60 isn't as good   i think the problem i am having is that maybe i am trying to destroy and recreate a code mirror instance in a dirty way because in the demo linked above  i get two errors  one when the toggle toolbar button is clicked and the same when switching to and from source mode  uncaught exception  typeerror  'b getselection' is not a function error thrown at line 12  column 946 in  anonymous function  select markselection  b  in http   heydojo co cc ckeditor codemirror ckeditor plugins codemirror js select js  var c b getselection    called from line 43  column 288 in  anonymous function  documentscanner    in http   heydojo co cc ckeditor codemirror ckeditor plugins codemirror js editor js  select markselection b win   so do you have any recommendations on how to destroy the codemirror instance cleanly straight after using the getcode   function  i've read through the manual and it doesn't look like there is such a function  thanks  tony

hi lars  1  i tested it and it also happens with a 'pure' pagelist list  2  i reported this some months ago  i think at the tag plugin and the template i am using  bootstrap3  3  i never used the task plugin before and cannot say exactly what has triggered this  but i encountered it as a problem in an intranet situation  and tested it tonight at quite another server but in the same dokuwiki configuration template  and pagelist is acting identical to the other configuration  private ubuntu server   normal in firefox  as reported in ie  thank you for your interest  and good luck  if i might be of any help  please let me know  martin van der knijff  gouda http   www mvak nl 0182 537217       original message      from  larsgit223 to  dokufreaks plugin pagelist cc  martk70   author sent  don  02 mrt 2017 17 49 subject  re   dokufreaks plugin pagelist  internet explorer table rows blow up  #92  hi  thanks for reporting the issue  i got some questions  is this also happening with lists created with the pagelist plugin or does it only happen with task lists  did you have this problem before or is it a new problem  if it's new  what happend  did you update any plugins or changed anyhting else  kind regards  lars — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread 
line 62  self _page mainframe   load qurl url   sorry  what i met is that it convert  25 or  5e or other special char to  2525 and  255e  and leave  20 unchanged   with this kind of url  i must change qurl   to fromencoded    
that did it  i could have sworn i tried that earlier today  regardless  that fixed it  thanks a ton for your quick response 
i will eventually have a pull request for some of these  but currently just a comment 
thanks for the help  it "go gets" now at least  the sample code didn't work initially  but after some minor fiddling it builds  i'm trying to learn go and thought an irc bot would be good to play with  so i don't entirely know what i'm doing yet 
thanks  i'll try that  true  maybe consider  lim score    0+  code    best 
roundcube version is 0 85   global addressbook vesion is working for most users when we configure it to maintain a single common addressbook for all email ids of all domains  but when we configure global address book to 'global_addressbook  d' then it shows following php error roundcube roundcubemail 0 8 5 program include rcube_user php  515   failed to create new user  on top of the page and in the center of the page we get following erro message shown by roundcube  "database error  connection failed  unable to connect to the database  please contact your server administrator " when i checked mysql database i found that the 'user' values are stored in enrypted formats  example  747265617375727940736269646668692e636f6d or say 636440736269646668692e636f6d are usernames in the table users   in the database and this might be the reasons for the error  the same configuration and plugin works on my offline roundcube setup  but not on the live online server  please advice exact solution 
i'm just using the web interface  clicking the contact in the global address book and dragging into the private address book  this moves it to the private one  removing it from the public one  i'm not using any additional plugin  like a customized version of 'additional_addressbook'   i know from former testing that copy contacts between addressbooks is possible  the carddav plugin allows this  therefore  i assumed that it's just a matter of the plugin code config  thanks for giving me some idea  i still have not checked what will happen if the global address book is readonly and the user tries to drag a contact into his own private address book

yes there is a space  i haven't worked out why but this does seem to be intentional by the sinatra community   i'm just starting to get to grips with their code

ehm   sorry if it's my mistake  but how do i add a dependency for scala 2 11 project in sbt

 beberlei sorry for long answer  my patches are in my fork  https   github com validname xhprof commit 0ede447b38c9d8f842b90426b225768e7248f678 and https   github com validname xhprof commit c50540d7337fdb3e7bdf015679701ceac350ae64  they both are concerned with php extension performance  that was primary goal to improve it  but i'm not an experienced developer and hadn't dealt with cross platform code compiling so my patches will probably work only with my couple of linux glibc and kernel  but we are using patched xhprof extension in our company now and have no problem except overhead  about 8 10  of average cpu usage with 50  of total cpu usage  that gives about 20  of overhead  but original extension works with 20 25  of overhead

i'm getting the same thing from the docs  from testing though  apps facebook com works properly for canvas iframe applications  whereas api seems to act more like facebook connect   it shows a greyed out "authorize this app" page inside the iframe  clicking it opens a new window similar to using facebook connect   technically mini_fb has it correct  with the exception that for an iframe canvas app you need a third url  apps facebook   it might be worth noting too that this looks like the "old" way to do things  however the fb docs for the new api don't really provide a lot of information regarding authenticating canvas iframe apps    their docs basically suck unless your using php  i'll keep looking through the docs to see what i come up with  i tried using some examples from your google groups  which mentioned iframe apps   but kept running into this problem 
apache 2 would work  if i can choose  i would prefer the original ruby or plain mit license  however  this is entirely up to you  this is your code  what's important is that whatever license you choose  you put in a copyright notice + the license file in the source dir  unless this is in place  it'a actually hard to get it accepted in many kind of foss contexts  ps  why not apache  it's not compatible with gpl  making it impossible to distribute it w gpl'd gems  unfortunately  we haver some of those used in the project  ds
so the problem was port 25  it was blocked  thanks anyway

you are missing my point and inferring things  i never said i expected flay to automatically "remove all the dupes"  i simply asked for it to give me more information  and this cuts what i actually said at a convenient point for you to bolster your argument  if you include the rest of the statement   "and compare them visually to see where the duplication ends"   it takes on an entirely different meaning  of course there is work to be done there  as you say  that is the point  but how much work  1 line  2 lines  40 lines  i have no idea based on the output  as it is  i have to go into the code and look  knowing how big the duplication is could certainly help me prioritize the issues  all i knew initially was it started on line 64  actually 44 or 33  take your pick   i did not know that a defn    method  how was i to know that  i certainly didn't know it had 32 nodes within  i think you may be assuming a familiarity with the internals of flay and the algorithms it uses that novice users may not have and may never acquire  at least i certainly don't have it   but i have already learned a great deal  i am only requesting information that it seems should be provided and that i would expect the parser to have handy already  to me this is information that would enhance flay  and judging by this comment  i would have to conclude that i am not alone 
even if we just look at the lower number  it's 40 times as big as what wireshark is reporting  i don't think tcp headers would be responsible for a 40x increase  can you try duplicating my test with "curl testmyids com"  you'll see that the traffic is nowhere near what prads is reporting  thanks  on wednesday  november 21  2012  kacper why wrote  ## doug burks http   securityonion blogspot com
i haven't had a chance to dig in and come up with a solution yet  one of the bits i'm worried about is a sensible way to detect i'm dealing with a path vs  any other string  i e  should we detect that we are on a windows system and if we are then check to see if we are dealing with a regex pattern that starts like a drive pathing   i e   a z    or some such

this is going to be the the same key value structure as used for headers in http parser  the name could be either keyvalue of queryparams  i like the keyvalue

it's not my design  i'm only a victim of it    https   github com nex3 sass issues 16 i took a look at the sass source just now though  and they started explicitly forwarding the options method a couple of months ago  apparently as a speed optimization  https   github com nex3 sass commit 780e43432b40199255e6b5a993a6d2d2c1deca20#commitcomment 604516   so rubyinline   sass ought to play nicely together now  at least  deprecating with the aim of moving towards inline_options would be great 
thanks that solves it i wonder however test and development go hand in hand _and_ putting rspec test group makes the 'spec  ' rake task not show up _so_ now i end up with rspec in my  development group and rspec requirements in the  test group  but that has nothing to do with vlad thanks again

i read the description here  _the descend filter is not applied to any directory names specified as  starting_points in the constructor _ this seems useful to me when i am looking for files only  so i can decide to search just the starting points or all deeper directories also  searching for directories  i see a need for a similar feature  i want to see either just the directories immediately within the starting points or i might be interested in all directories through all levels

it’s a macos system with multitude of files  we don’t have control over the names  users can save them as they please and apparently some like to have names with colons  it’s really no big deal to us since i switched to using the  from_local_file method  unless we end up allowing remote and local locations in which case being able to always use  from would be handy   anyhow  just thought would let you guys know of this edge case and thanks for putting this useful gem out there 
that's correct  we use it as a 'reporting' module in cuckoo    which is  malheur generates a report based off of other reports  json  so that it can be compared with previous samples that have been analyzed by cuckoo to find similarly behaving analyses  malheur receives pure json but is converted into mist  during this conversion process we simplify the set of data  i can provide examples of json reports  or example output results from malheur if need be  here's the information we collect though  https   github com brad accuvant cuckoo modified blob master modules reporting malheur py#l52
with deeper inspection  i discover that this doesn't happen normally  instead  it happens only when i remove the same shape  which is a poly with non static body  for the second time  preventing this repeat removal seems to fix the problem in my game  but i was not able to replicate the issue in a simple example  amusingly  calling #remove_shape twice was a bit of a bug in my logic  so pointing it out to me has done me a favour

hi  i have the same errors and i have ubuntu 12 04   vim 7 3 too  how can it be fixed 
sure  it outputs esubtypes everywhere   the esubtypes is there because ecore_ext brings it in  it make the super sub type bidirectional   which is a really bad idea since it alters the ecore model when the model is extended  although i understand that you may want this in a controlled environment  
also if they are not inherited no issues are reported  i just tried with

sure  i can get around it  but the point is that since all of the data is always in fact going to be utf 8  the library should honour that

i checked the google api console  we haven't run out of queries  actually  until now i did not use an api key at all  and as i cannot save a section i cannot add an api key  while saving a section with a map location field leads to a timeout  i can without any troubles edit existing entries with a map location field and create new entries  i can also use the location search feature of map location field  when editing creating an entry  i can enter an address and press "update map" and it will update the map  all this tells me the server can well connect to google  do have any other idea what to test

right  and other api wrappers bindings allow you to reblog them directly with one request  not to mention you can do this by hitting the api directly  http   www tumblr com docs en api v2#reblogging   if there's a way of doing this with www  tumblr that works i haven't been able to figure it out

i use file tail to read some log4j generated logs  which are automatically rotated each day  in the meantime  my script writes the line number already read to a file when interrupted   in order to resume from that exact location when restarted  via a  log_file forward saved_lineno     the lack of rewinding causes this mechanism to fail after a log rotation  as the lineno value is incorrect 
indeed  i'm rather happy that you still expend the effort to support this tool despite your having no use for it   i've mentioned it a few times over in the  https   www linuxquestions org questions slackware 14   linuxquestions slackware forum  because it's a very nice tool  updating the documentation to say something similar to the above would be the most cost effective solution to this issue

all manor of crashes  it sometimes even crashes when it's sitting idle  my work involves a lot of process automation  right now i am creating extensive python scripts to automate mapping and data workflows  after i run a script that modifies a layout  for example adding a layer to an existing layoutitemlegend than the session becomes unstable and if i attempt to open the layout that was modified qgis churns for a long while and then crashes  interestingly  it seems that if i wait for a few minutes after my script completes then there seem to be fewer crashes as if there is additional housekeeping happening after my script finishes  this is one example  but as i said the crashes have been pretty frequent  so much so that i have restored my system from an image and only installed base programs to make sure i don't have a corrupt install  they also occur on two separate pcs  i do a lot of saving to minimize data loss  but having a restore mechanism would be much more efficient  i think it's normal that there will be a few crashed when using the latest version of open source software  having the ability to restore one's last session would definitely encourage more people to use and test development versions

it looks like it is due to the fact that the pages were inserted manually to accomodate organization sizing of the additional frames needed for overflow  as otherwise  i just got one additional frame per page when handled automatically by the layout engine  would the template or project be helpful at this juncture

good morning  this error has been constantly occurring after installation on this machine  and at the time of the error  there are no concurrent processes from other systems or other layers being edited as it still occurs in the "validation" version 3 4 10 installation  in version 2 18 28  the same project works without any kind of error  in the same environment there is another machine that works perfectly      the only difference is owning like s o win 10 
ok  many thanks for your fast help  i just replaced the  coalesce   function with  concatenate   i think nyalldawson  you made a lapsus   and it works now  the inline help is indeed ambiguous  as the expected format shown in the formula window of the shifting fields is  double  x y    while the field description correctly states the valid input type as  string

 damon atkins  i don't know a heck of a lot about windows  it just seemed that use of delayed start was solving a problem that i think others might have  and by looking at the types of services that used delayed start it seemed to be that it would be the most appropriate choice to use  if instead it makes more sense to not use delayed start and set up dependencies then i accept that  if it's true   at any rate could you advise  twangboy on what you think the most appropriate choices are for the salt minion   standard start with no dependencies  or whatever the presente dependencies are  doesn't seem right to me and that's my overall point

 basepi i think the reason i wanted this was that sometimes template code will produce malformed yaml and then the state won't render into something that state show_highstate can show  it just produces an error  the idea is that as a template development tool  it'd be really nice to _see_ what yaml is being produced  whenever my templates produce un compileable yaml i often find myself flailing around in the dark for a while trying to visualize in my head what the yaml is being produced by the template is anyway 
 ch3ll i wrote it like so 
yep  tried it already    didn't help although it doesn't suppose to fix it because salt run doesn't require the salt minion to be installed 
showing differences character by character would have caught this  i sure cannot deny that    something like that would help for file managed  etc    too  but i don't know how much work that is to make and whether it's more readable  there's a reason the commandline 'diff' is a line by line diff

put the file on the system at the end of the state run  after the grains have been set  and then ideally  i'd like to restart a service after that  i used to do this with a bunch of watch's  but i'd like to use listen listen_in for better ordering 
seems like that style could be prone to error  but y'all know the code base better than i

hi  rallytime  i'm happy with the patch  however iirc from reading other salt issue pages  being on the develop branch doesn't automatically mean the code will hit a release milestone  as commits are cherry picked  can you please clarify this  if it will end up in a future release  i'm happy for this to be closed  thanks 
i ran it without any trouble  and it seems to work  thanks for the heads up 
interesting… here's what i get on our minion 
master is 0 13   
unfortunately not atm  but it was fixed by adding a ipv4 address to the server 
i ll give it a go
yes  that's where things get strange   i have 3 computers in debian 7  all vms under a vmware esxi and with exactly the same hardware  software components  etc  i did add the saltstack repo  its gpg key  aptitude update  aptitude upgrade  then "aptitude install salt minion"  every dependencies seems to be pulled from the debian repo  but 2 out of the 3 servers fails with the m2crypto error  i have also debian 6 servers  they are ok  the salt master is one of them  and will have to apply some admin mojo on debian 5 too  but later   i have done some investigating  and now my suspicion is that my wheezy servers aren't exact clones  and something is interfering somewhere     but what    that's really annoying   well    i will export those vms for reference and further investigating  then restart from scratch with fresh clones  they are still empty machines anyway

 techhat i see your point hmmm  pip understands comments in  requirements txt   if so it might be worth adding a comment directing humans to read the packaging page for more information 
i tried with root  salt minion service and salt call both using root  and i got the same error
for me  and for now  i really only care about salt cloud  but i could see in the future wanting the args for salt  salt call  salt run  salt cp  etc  i think it would be nice to have it available for overriding  and i think it's just a matter of adding the loglevelmixin to the commands that need it  i was playing with how to add it to salt  but once the command was published to 0mq it would begin logging to the default log file again that's set in the master config  haven't figured out if it's possible to pass logging information into the pub  but it doesn't look like it 
thanks  basepi for the tip  preliminary tests show the same error  but we've been slammed with other stuff lately which is why i haven't been able to focus much attention on this  i'm trying to get to a point where i can carve out the time to test this completely  stay tuned

the state used to upgrade the minions was https   gist github com jalons 3d68c1b69722c4f95677 the package is the 0 17 5 from koji  rebuilt with a patch to enable the gitfs caching  terminalmage did  after reporting this issue  we noticed this in two other environments  each environment has stand alone master with minions reporting to it   i have not had a chance to look into what can does invalidate minion side caches of _modules   i'm presuming there's something that handles _states  _grains  and _modules  i don't see any minion side changes in the gitfs caching introduced in https   github com saltstack salt pull 9916  which is what the local patch is based off of   so i don't believe the patch would be related 
 basepi   this is because of wrong jinja formatting  it's all about minus signs after  # and before # 
 techhat assuming the repo name is ignored  the command itself should still be working right  so it just ignores the arg value  and runs the command  if that's the case it still doesn't seem to be updating the repo 
 gtmanfred sure  i need to finish the project i'm working on and then i'll get a pr submitted

 cachedout the master's cache directory has 44k files and 36k directories   basepi i tried a subset of minions and it started working  i was indeed using those settings  i modified them even further and added additional delays  now it looks like this  what has changed  really  is that the number of minions is growing  since there's enough free memory available  in your opinion  more core will help  it is not pegging for 3 hours anymore at startup but i suspect it will start happening as the numbers grow further 
i'm using git develop branch head as of report time   sorry  with first reports  i added specific rev  but with bunch i filed  that piece got dropped  it was 0a31f3b38a3474f56523b99199be91eaf721e661
i'm looking at a private repo  with lots of heads  36187 and counting      on a good connection it takes 30s without specifying the head and 16s when i specify it  so that's definitely an improvement  but still a significant time  i understand the case where a specific branch like  develop  has to be verified  but i meant the specific case of head   in this case  i don't care about the remote branch  the only thing i want to achieve is having the repository cloned   but not in any specific state otherwise  i think that  update_head  false  rev  head  could be treated specially  it's not even a real branch tag  and skip the check altogether 
 basepi yes  hence  my above state  even if i misunderstood  template_str then it should continue to execution  which is does not and my point  it displays a parser error when trying to compile the template string  from that you're saying  the yaml is correct and therefore i should be about to just iterate through  however  how can i do so given the output from pillar get  the docs use some form of  however  this fails when used with the above state and even with the pillar get probably due to the empty output  not sure  let me ask another way  now that i've had a little sleep   how do we iterate as you described in your comment 
i just copied the mine_functions inside the minion config and still get nothing back  same behavior 
shadowfax chc  i've been trying to reproduce this in my salt sandbox environment  to find out if it only happens with multiple remotes  but right now i can't reproduce the problem    according to the debug log the fileserver backends get updated every 60s which i think is the default for loop_interval  then  in the salt sandbox environment i have no minions running right now  so i am not sure it is a function of load 
as requested 
''#verify_env  true ''# set the number of hours to keep old job information in the job cache ''#keep_jobs  24 ''# set the default timeout for the salt command and api  the default is 5 ''# seconds ''#timeout  5 i haven't made any changes regarding house keeping  but as for 24     is seems to keep 24 days 
not sure if this is relevant  the whole state highstate is done in salty vagrant using  vagrant provision  or  vagrant up  
 basepi same machines as #8845
yes  it now works successfully 
sorry about the delay in getting back to this  i've been tracking down some alien crosstalk issues in the data center   not fun    before we start the salt minion on the windows host running the commands will need to be started by a domain user with sufficient privileges to make edits to dns zones and dhcp leases  dns is probably easier to deal with than dhcp  so let's start there  we'll need to specify the dc  it's likely easiest to do this by ip just in case hosts servers are dual homed and dns dhcp aren't listening on all interfaces  arguments to pass into "add method"   the " f" flags just indicate a force  this is because deletes are interactive if not forced  i'm cheating a bit since i use dig with a zone transfer to pull all of the addresses currently in a given a d zone and then do the diffs in memory to determine if updates are necessary  you can use nslookup or dig per address  reverse dns  and hostname  forward dns  to determine if that address needs to be updated instead  "delete" methods would be just like the updates minus the adds  nothing too complicated there  i have add modify delete methods and check to see with every highstate if any of my managed hosts need to be updated in a d dns  dhcp netsh examples to follow in a bit

none of the scheduled functions run  i added both of them so i could see there is not somthing specific to the highstate and so i could debug faster  on thu  feb 20  2014 at 7 40 pm  colton myers notifications github comwrote

hey  garethgreenaway my initial thoughts are that we'll probably have a key in the data structure defined below  and then the query  salt run jobs list_job 'foo bar'  i need to devote more thought to this though  but this is roughly what we'll need  thanks 
 note that we worked with the docker folks to work around this    they stopped using sni  but i'm sure this will come up again sooner as ip space gets more precious and more people demand https  
on develop branch  commit 4a6baf0  as i said 
sorry  i was on vacation and i pretty much unplugged  i haven't changed the hashing algorithm  but here are the master config and the minion config of one of the problem systems  here is a gist instead of the markdown mangled configs  https   gist github com 96fcde022f27845badf0 git
your example simply removes all linefeeds  i was just looking for a "cleaner" solution  but my current  works for now  so i'll keep that 
 cachedout unsure  that is the first version i installed  and its always behaved this way  but always defaulting to  base  no matter what the minion's environment is

confused  there shouldn't be a loop    re  point #2 in your comment  it should be "if 'one' shows changes  'four' should run _after_ both 'one' and 'three'"    no  perhaps i'm missing something  but i understood prereq to imply that the pre required state would always be run _before_ the pre requiring state  since the pre required state has to execute in order to determine changes or not  and the pre requiring state doesn't know if it should run or not until after the prerequired one has been run      edit  re  test true    i realize this will have an impact as you say on the execution evaluation of prereq stuff    fwiw i tried this one both ways  with and without   and same difference  it errors the same both ways  but thanks for the pointer  i'll double check to make sure the real sls i'm building doesn't 'break' on test true

salt cloud install docs don't say anything about the merge  i've uninstalled salt cloud and salt and installed salt 2014 1 0  salt cloud is included  and the problem still exists  w dniu 12 03 2014 11 39  erik johnson pisze 
below is the output of the salt   versions report salt   versions report salt  2014 1 0 python  2 6 6  r266 84292  dec 27 2010  21 57 32  jinja2  2 5 5 m2crypto  0 20 1 msgpack python  0 1 10 msgpack pure  not installed pycrypto  2 1 0 pyyaml  3 09 pyzmq  2 2 0 zmq  2 2 0
yes  i have minions with ubuntu 12 04  redhat and scientific linux  all with saltstack version 2014 1 0 and working 
i am quite sure that some changes have been made during the test run as we lost the nfs mount on the boxes i tested on  i rolled out the actual change immediately afterwards to get the boxes back into production and can therefore not really reproduce the exact setup  i only discovered this in my "post mortem" analysis and can not actually be sure that the line had been removed  but _something_ caused a umount  i will look into this in more detail next week and it would probably be preferable to have a small proof of concept for this behaviour  so i will concentrate on that 
sure  the code was from the  2014 7  branch and versions report is   and we added the  soft  option  the salt run completes and exits with the  forced remount because options changed  message from state mount py → mounted     quoted above  but neither is the change performed  because nfs requires an unmount and  salt 'mount remount'   is therefore not appropriate  nor is the change in option persisted to the fstab  because of the  return ret  that causes the function to exit before the  if persist   branch ever had a chance to do what it was meant to do 
i have not seen a single  salt presence change  at all  so it might very well be completely broken  but even in that case an offline minion shouldn't be listed in   my impression is that the presence status of a minion is never updated anymore 
that is exactly what i was thinking of  yes  it's nice that one can white and blacklist branches environments already  but in some cases the setup would be much easier if one could disable the branch → environment mapping altogether 
upgraded everything to  2017 7 4  and can not reproduce the problem right now  i shall re open this issue if i run into it again 
i know  but currently the dict is   'tenant name'   'id'  …  'name'  …  …   so to resolve a tenant_id you need something ugly like this   my current code already checks if the returned dict is a one key dict and unwraps it  we could add the typical "this will change in  release" so people have some time to update their code  and some comments  log debug     or info   stating thes lines are for backwards compatibility with … lithium and beryllium i guess 
 jfindlay i'll try to fix this asap but i'm afraid it will take a few days of wading through  glanceclient  to figure out what causes the 404s  401 i would understand when i can't use a session token acquired with the admin token for anything than keystone or something  the  _auth    seems slightly different between the modules so one of them behaving strangely differently isn't too surprising  more tomorrow 
thanks to you  gtmacdonald  it works 
apologies if i'm missing something here  i'll add as much info as possible  module   yumpkg py branch   develop def upgrade this function's options surrounded by the parentheses  suggest only support for 'fromrepo'  the help output below that lists 'enablerepo' as a repository option  in the code however  i can't for the life of me see where it handles the 'enablerepo' command switch  i hit the issue whilst actually trying to do an upgrade through pkg upgrade with a enablerepo switch  i would of thought from the docs this has the same supported arguments as pkg install but unless i'm missing something  could very well be the case   i can't see how i'd get that working  as an example   from 2014 1 10   below i install the command using enablerepo in the pkg install command  but when i try upgrade then it fails

 ch3ll the client  ssh salt  runs as non root user and the client connects to localhost as root  i tried it with salt 2017 7 3  and yes  it works with the old version of salt 
this should reproduce it  although i should add that since  4b4fb3fb  https   github com saltstack salt commit 4b4fb3fb52f7e3dd71c49bdfe58a88fdc48896c0   the fact that the repo is created by salt does not matter here  and subsequent runs fail the same way 
does salt run have anything to do with minions  here's another run with debug logs 
yes  killing extra minion instances solved the issue  but  running small changes with in large environment is still annoying 
i have indeed  one of the formulas i was toying around with is updating a bind zone file  i believe the root of the problem could be somewhere in the salt mine though because i have another formula that used to generate  etc hosts based on minion's network ip_addrs which apparently isn't working anymore either  the bind test formula  this was running on the minion i reported the problem for   right now this is all running in my lab setup and when i checked today all 21 minions were unresponsive and there were four salt minion processes running on each of them  interestingly the error message they are logging in  var log salt minion is the same they would be logging when their key hasn't been accepted yet  i e  salt master has cached    etc    so i'm not sure if the two problems are related or if i've ran into another bug  will have to debug that further 
that's it  thank you so much 
say you have 10 servers and each has it's own setting for innodb pool size  open firewall ports  sshd port and whatever else may be needed  i've been looking for possible options to do that and these were per host grains or pillars  but they are too cumbersome to setup you will likely need a sparate file for each host to only have these settings  you can see this discussion  https   groups google com forum # topic salt users 6bpss imbiw this was all about pillars  however i don't see why we can't have something like this directly in top sls
i would love that 
 basepi yes  a lot actually  so  for now  i would able to achieve what we need by implementing the later solution  you said there are only two things to cue off something  would it make sense to add a third one  something like like "tags" where each state could publish arbitrary pieces of data which then can be listened on by other states 
looks good   +1 
 cachedout   i see that pyzmq versions differ  i've tried to upgrade it on a minion with no luck  debian stable   i will try to do it with pip but as i remember i had difficulties installing pyzmq + zmq with pip  does it matter 
real use case  i needed to install virtualbox guest additions automatically  i didn't find function for this in salt  i spent some time  and created #15175  i developed it under  _modules  and  _states  directory  in salt root   which are under version control  i knew that this could be useful for others  to i uploaded those modules to the salt development branch  then i understood that i have forgotten to check this  document that  etc  i was forced to change this file in the first place  commit  copy it to the salt repo  commit there    it's not very interesting  i couldn't use  develop  version of salt because this is my production server  i guess that a "true way" would be run development version of salt  create separate vm for testing  write unit tests  check it  check documentation  then create a final version of my modules and copy them to the production server  but i didn't read how to write unit tests for salt and didn't have enough time for doing this in a right way  if this feature would be implemented i could just use  develop  branch for developing those modules and point into them in the configs 
i thought that this approach could fail if i have different salt versions on minion and master  they could potentially have different functions   also this doesn’t help with other lists  files  packages  grains  states  etc  
just for convenience  moreover it's very easy to implement 
 jfindlay  oh  forgot to mention 
2014 1 10
in my "real code" i'm firing some events back and forth between the master and minions for message passing  but while testing it i'm generating events by hand  the actual sequence of events is more like 
because i don't want to have to place a script  as root  somewhere so that salt cloud can access it  i did see that you can specify a full path for the script  but if i'd simply like some 2 3 commands run in order  not necessarily same order or commands  on 20 profiles  i'd have to manage another 20 files  instead of 1 file with the 20 profiles  i also find it to be more obvious what instance will do once bootstrapped by just looking at the profile  if it was anything more complex  and across several profiles  i'd agree  a separate bootstrap script would be more useful and have used that previously

well  it was a complete surprise to me  i would never expect  file replace  to change a file attribute like that  and most especially not if  file replace  doesn't actually make any changes  i would expect  file replace  to dereference the symbolic link and operate on the regular file it points to 
i don't want to talk to multiple minions  just the local one  i just want to run states  re initializing the loader and renderer in between  that way i can have a state that does something  then run another state that can render  via jinja or whatever  objects set by the prior state 
no  it doesn't  as you note in the first state  the newer one   i'm only passing    tar_options  "  strip 1"  and it's making a tar command that reads  'tar'  'x  strip 1'  ' f'  when it should be  'tar'  'x'  '  strip 1'  ' f'

hadn't thought about that  not particularly familiar with the salt internals  but i guess that would necessitate implementing unless onlyif with an ordereddict  salt utils odict  which seems overkill  a multi line "unless    " with lines trailed with '    ' might just be more explicit and expressive  perhaps just a documentation update to include such an example of a complex unless statement would be warranted  really though the silently doing nothing with a dictionary inside an unless  no error  nothing executed  just "unless succeed"  is the kind of yaml saltstack idiosyncrasy that can drive you mad  that part feels like a bug to me

hi  while looking for the data i requested  i noticed that the problem is not just that the minion that you run the command on re auths  for every command i run on any given host  all the minions that are connected to the master do a re auth  for example  if i run a test ping to hostname foo debug log on the minion 
this is more of a documentation   error reporting issue as discussed in #16724  closing since the bug  as reported  is invalid  apologies 
here is the full log  http   pastebin com zrafjxw0 the relevant part should start at line  2172
this is on 2014 7  here is the orchestration i'm testing 
it would be nice if pillar could be defined the same way as states formulas with gitfs and refresh with loop interval  as a workaround i've changed ext_pillar to pillar with local directory which is cloned from git by cron every 10 minutes 
so finally should we just check availability of 169 254 169 254  i'm wondering if is there better solution because it could bring some latency into grains generation when this address is not available or responding slowly  but on the other side short timeout to that connection could be enough  i'm not aware now about 100  sure way of determining if instance is ec2  ironic or nova instance but i could investigate that  maybe existence of cloud init in system   
 whiteinge   the difference is that there are no concurrent requests  interestingly  i switched the salt master to raet transport and was able to successfully login and use the token     on a linux system or cygwin  curl on a windows   gives me an authentication error 
"super master" or master of masters 
we are running 2 minions on the servers  1   root minion for ops people 2  user minion for application people because the 2nd minion runs with in user we need sudo rights  but not everything have to run as sudo  just specific commands like "yum  zypper  service  systemctl etc"  what i did now i change the cmdmod and made a sudocmdlist config in the minion config  the cmdmod module now validates the list and checks if he must use sudo or not  better would be an kwarg which command should run with sudo  my solution   https   github com bigg01 salt sudo wrapper blob master module readme md
yes 
excellent  adding ' runner' does fix that query  that might be something to add to the release notes  as this is a change for currently working 2014 1    setups and it was not obvious what was needed  thanks much 
 jfindlay i believe the subset function is a new feature first released in 2016 3    salt doc only shows the local_subset funtion in development release  https   docs saltstack com en develop topics netapi #salt netapi netapiclient local_subset    so i don't have anything to compare it to  according to the  google groups discussion  https   groups google com forum # topic salt users 3jh5u1sd294  about the feature  it should work with the salt api 
thanks for your reply   jfindlay  not off the top of my head  it may indeed be that the issues that i am remembering were blocked awaiting more data from the op  i'll give you a heads up if i spot something like that  i sometimes peruse closed issues looking for info  with regards to your previous response  i've got a pretty good handle  what i think of  as the outter layer modules as to the master minion functionality split  most of the time  at that layer  it is reasonably obvious as to whether or not a module function is meant for minion only or master only use  runner wheel pillar tops    master execution util    mix states grains    minion i think where the fog sets in  for me anyway  is in that middle layer  returners and log handlers come to mind  i guess i assumed that the salt master environment would be a first tier customer for these kinds of modules  i find execution  grains and state modules to be  relatively  brain dead simple to debug since they are running in a fairly low concurrency environment  however  the salt master  being extremely concurrent and touching all the things is a bit tricker  i'm hoping to have a block of time in the next couple months to revisit the log handler code  maybe bring it into line with both the minion and master environments  would sure be a useful thing to have   anyway  thanks again 
loren  short version  i end up at the http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation windows html http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation windows html doc link and it only goes up to 2015 5 0 2 version  hence my issue i raised  long version  well my steps are usually  1  www saltstack com http   www saltstack com  click on community on top right  that get’s me to 2  http   saltstack com community  http   saltstack com community  once there i choose ‘learn salt’ and click on the ‘documentation’ link in middle column  which gets me to 3  http   docs saltstack com en latest  http   docs saltstack com en latest  where i click on the ‘installation’ hyperlink under the ‘download’ section  which get’s me to the installation section 4  http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation index html http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation index html where i click on ‘windows’ and this gets me to 5  http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation windows html http   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation windows html which stops at the 2015 5 0 2 http   docs saltstack com downloads salt minion 2015 5 0 2 x86 setup exe versions      ok  i will get busy doing updating the windows winner sls files for the updated x86 and amd64 versions of the newer salt minions  btw do you happen to know who one would speak to about saltstack adding the building of the new or updated minion windows winrepo sls files to the build or release process   utahdave
 jfindlay sure works for me too      i was simply trying to keep the salt winrepo and winrepo ng salt minion sls files updated with the official releases in the git repso  but i guess some rcs don't make sense to be published there  and it looks to me like there is only two commits or so between rc4 and rc5  should have checked these details 
the minion is windows 2008 r2  the issue is when we do a   the items that show failed are packages with a "space" in the name that is returned  i have tried renaming them in my init sls files  but they still seem to fail  mow 7zip and notepad++ work fine    just curious how to get around this or have i misconfigured something 
joseph  i had tested 'placementgroup' this morning before i submitted the issue  thanks  bramh bramh gupta president  srb technologies   571 338 2443   www srbtech com   cloud  middleware  big data  consulting
thanks for the clarification  concerning the  top sls  file and minions matching  multiples typos messed up with my mind  but i managed to find them  thanks again for the support 
thank you  rallytime  i simplified like this  with same behaviour 
 abednarik thank you 
we are not doing a pillar refresh from within a state  all of the examples above are directly from the cli  i took the following steps  1  no changes made to pillar data  1  salt saltmaster1 pillar item python 2  salt saltmaster1 pillar get python both commands retrieve the same data 2  update the pillar data  1  salt saltmaster1 pillar item python 2  salt saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct  updated  data  the pillar get retrieves the old data  3  refresh the pillar data  1  salt saltmaster1 saltutil refresh_pillar 2  salt saltmaster1 pillar item python 3  salt saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct  updated  data  the pillar get retrieves the old data  4  restart the salt master  1  service salt master restart 2  salt saltmaster1 pillar item python 3  salt saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct  updated  data  the pillar get retrieves the old data  5  restart the salt minion  1  service salt minion restart 2  salt saltmaster1 pillar item python 3  salt saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct  updated  data  the pillar get retrieves the correct updated  data  so it appears that only by restarting the minion does this correct the data  what are the circumstances under which pillar get will have different information from pillar item  using pillar get in states is desirable for something like   otherwise you end up needing to validate that the pillar exists as you think it does layer by layer 
with redhat lsb core rpm installed   the logic is to try and find those values in  etc lsb release if it exists  and then try  etc centos release if it doesn't  with redhat lsb core rpm installed  etc lsb release exists  but doesn't contain the necessary information   it can only be gathered from  etc centos release 
running 2014 7 0 but i looked at the current develop code for modules ps py but it only has
 jfindlay thanks    here you go
this is a new installation of 2015 8 1  and i have noticed these errors since the installation  the code has not been modified in any way  salt master was installed as following 
thanks  terminalmage i will have a look at the list_pkgs code in pkg py understand the current common data structures 
is their a way to generate the doco in html format so it can be checked  from the checkout git
sorry  by argv style i mean the program arguments are specified in an array  rather than as a space separated string which must then be parsed by the shell  quotes are used to influence the parsing of the latter  so yes  i don't think you want quotes here  and removing the repr   should fix the problem  i'll try to test it  is there a target date for 2014 7 2

hi  i am reasonably sure that we don't have any existing state highstate running  i've restarted the services on both the master and this minion  i don't find anything in  var cache salt minion proc 
sure

to verify this  i created an instance using salt cloud  then connected to it and found no minion  should have bootstrapped 2014 7 2   manually installing 2014 7 2 using winexe afterwards also didn't work  however  it worked with 2014 7 1 
no  _cmd wait_ is not being called if _ some file_ exists  although the watched file _myfile_ has been modified  i would expect it to be executed if either the watched file has been modified or the to be created file doesn't exist  each one regardless of the other condition 
duplicate ticket ref #28640
thanks for your answer  my bad  i guess i didn't use the salstack official repo for installing the minion  i'll do that first thing on monday and get back to you 
 jfindlay   what is the best way to determine the backend  from what i can tell  i have not installed any of those  and salt is using git directly  when i review the module's code    usr lib python2 7 dist packages salt modules git py  on the filesystem   i only see the  cmd  module used to run  git  directly  and the module's  __virtual__    does a  which git  
yes i did  that why i think the issue is with git  here my lsof  open file count   160k 
 lorengordon it seems like yum points to  2017 12  instead of  latest    tweaking   etc yum conf  did not seem to work  regardless  i will wait patiently for the new salt release to drop   
sure 
i guess i could  but it still feels wrong 
hi  apologies for the late response  the salt version for the master is  salt  2014 7 1 and the minion is  salt  2014 7 1 we installed salt via yum and we are running oracle linux 6 on both minion and master  thanks 
fresh ubuntu 14 04 install with a root password set and no other modifications  salt ssh fails no matter what command i try  as stated at the end of the above comment  other means of connecting via ssh w  pasword work fine  i can do it from command line with ssh  and i've got a node+pty js script that spawns a command line process which also works fine 
yes  this happens consistently  if i remove the repository  i can reproduce the entire process  with the first run succeeding  and the second run failing   and also every run after the second fails in the same way as the second run  output of  salt call  l debug   local state sls gitbug  https   gist github com bjwebb c9676fa89a2e2e668fe4 also  here's the output of the same command is run the first time  when the repository does not yet exist  https   gist github com bjwebb 1ca1eb0ab50bd6578487
yes i am following same document    on fri  apr 10  2015 at 5 00 pm  wolodja wentland notifications github com wrote  ## _regards _ _skylabreddyinfrastructure specialist for cloud coe   ibm cloud india      +91 968 664 4000_
yes  this is perfectly reproducible for me  test sls   after some further experimentation  i only see this occur when 1  the source file does not exist  and 2  the source file is a  jinja  template 
i am running salt minion as a service in sudo   cachedout may i know  how can i give user and group for extracted files and folders
added pr #51364
output from debug log   i think the saltenv attribute is not working  if i remove it from the command the highstate is executed but only the first  base  section 
yep thanks for support  i close this  i test this tommorow and get back to you if i have further questions   +1 
 dwoz thanks for advice  tried both  master_id   and  id   at master config  but exception still happens   waynew thanks for your patience  i agree that this issue depends on environment  checking variable values  without  127 0 1 1 hostname  line in  etc hosts   so the reason why   all fqdns returns a single dot is   lack of a valid ipv6 reverse dns    and hostname line at  etc hosts forced ipv4 only reverse lookup instead of ipv6         i guess we can conclude that salt master currently fails to boot if it gets invalid response on hostname reverse dns lookup  must salt master rely on it  could it use some fallback value in case for ' ' or even any invalid reverse dns response  not trying to pin responsibility  i agree that this is an environment issue and empty reverse dns is not a common case  just wondering if its possible to workaround such situation to avoid startup block 
hey  i'll give it a try over the weekend and will report back with the results  thanks 
from pillar_roots  i will update my issue description 
 jfindlay
so  i have the pillar specified before  and this code  so  based on data from pillar  i want to generate every file with own config   file1  to has data from  data1        file1      pillar 'deploy'  data1       so  there is a way to specify  hey config file  please put only data from pillar 'deploy'  data1   not all as it's doing now 
i've set  i've added manually to check that scheduler is generally working   it's working fine  the only problem i have   i can't manage it from scheduler states 
so far only the salt cloud  p has the problem
 jfindlay yes  that should warn anyone running into the issue that private_ips isn't specified and may need to be specified 
 ch3ll yes  at first the feature of dynamic branch mapping with  __env__  was about to be dropped  but then #28282 has been merged into 2015 8 0  so we expected the legacy git pillar to keep working  the merge was a response to #28125 
2016 3 2 i believe
yes  i did  i think that it's too complex workflow  master   api   pepper  i actually don't need api but i have to install it to have remote cli  pepper is in pre alpha  actually  it is broken  https   github com saltstack pepper issues 40#issuecomment 117733768  right now  and pepper is mirroring  salt  commands  so it's just another cli that's actually a mirror of the first one  with the only feature   to allow remote calls  so why do you need two equal cli   salt  could be the one 
strange  it looks good now  when i had put in this ticket the content on the first page was still the old libcloud info 
virt what doesn't exist on freebsd  but i've basically debugged the problem down to a dozen or more cmd run calls  the code calls cmd run intead of subprocess call but i cannot see what is happening inside cmd run since the log level is lost and nothing is logged inside there 
 cachedout the document looks good  and currently waiting for #25908 in order to validate the same  
sorry  missed the notification on this   we are using the latest 2015 5 3 available from the apt repository 
master  salt 2015 5 2  lithium  minions  salt call 2015 5 2  lithium  salt call exe 2014 7 2  helium 
sure  i will be more than happy to help with that little grain of salt  just having a look to the issue seems i commit twice for the same issue  but only the last one  a08be24  is the correct one  first one  634f1f4  is wrong 
this is what i found on the site  https   github com capitalone hygieia tree master api
i can put together a list when i get a bit more time  the weekend should do   but in the meantime i have a thought  right now if you call one of those functions you get an error  so as long as the function is going to throw an error anyway  why not make them all available and let them error out if they don't work on windows  or at least issue an explicit "this is not available on windows" error  
+1 on  use_salt_pip   that would be much clearer  we're trying to use the same formulas in both our windows and linux environments  and having to differentiate on bin_env and cwd would make them much less clear  explicitly saying that we want to use the bundled pip would on the other hand be clear 
 ch3ll i think that default in code should be the same as in example config  i am happy to make a pr if salt developers agree  if salt developers disagree  i'd like to understand why 
i can trade the docs pr for a fix for #38758   
i'm running 2015 5 3  from the  saltstack salt ppa  https   launchpad net  saltstack +archive ubuntu salt   on master and minions  the master and minions are running ubuntu 14 04 64 bit server  i did some digging in the code and it looks like it will not be trivial to change  salt states host present    to behave as i had originally expected  this is due to the way the  names declaration  http   docs saltstack com en latest ref states highstate html#names declaration  works  i have an idea on how to get the behavior i want  i'll submit a merge request when i have the time to put it together

here's the state  as for the output it looks like there is some binary daa mixed in  the issue could be in the salt mine also   i'm trying to see if there is any thing inmy state that might cause it
sure  i've put everything into this gist  https   gist github com djpain d0bbb643719f8831ef88
 ch3ll yes  after calling  saltutil refresh_pillar  it worked  but a highstate should do the same  shouldn't it 
i have not gotten anything from setting zmq_monitor  true
affirmative
nothing in the logs so far  plenty of memory on the minions   it doesn't appear when targeting one minion only  appears frequently when there is plenty of output from 5+ minions 
 jfindlay   thanks for checking in  here's the info 
 jfindlay   your command works fine  i'm also using cmd run in other states without problems  the only difference is that i'm using a pipe in the problematic one  i think that might be the cause 
hi  jfindlay   this is my salt version    i'm using   debian wheesy   regards 
hi  have have test it on two different machines  i have test it on mij macbook and my virtual machine centos 7 1 clean install  on my mac it works and on my vm not  the version i am using on my centos machine is the development branch  but is also happend when installing it from the new repo saltstack com  versions macos   i also created a script in python using boto 2 38 0 and create multiple subnets create_subnet function  with it and this works on both my mac an centos  let me know if i need to test things out 
salt minion 2015 8 1  beryllium  salt 2015 8 1  beryllium 
i can confirm that i'm using state sls  i'm attempting to test with highstates now  but it sounds as though that code path does not have this issue  i've worked around it for now with   but it will probably effect a lot of people who run state sls 
yes  thnx
i tried adding the double quotes as suggested and that doesn't seem to make any difference  hopefully the output you wanted below  thank you     etc mtab 
i was upgrade both master and minion  now all ok 
 strocknar ya fiddled around some more and it started working   didnt spend the time to see what item fixed it but i started with http   irclog perlgeek de salt 2014 12 24 text and found this irc thread talking about the negative timeout issue  next i look for the loop text  in my scenario it was uncommented so i commented out  restarted the syndic  still had issue  restarted the master and life became good 
regarding the the cpu mem running salt now pings the processors and memory will go from  600 megs to around 1 74gb when running this statement   see the picture included  this is while running the state listed above    selection_003  https   user images githubusercontent com 5123879 31176677 ae5fa9fc a8e1 11e7 82a9 b1d265f0f1ed jpg  additional information  this server is only running the salt master it is not being used for anything else 
yes it did 
it could be an acceptable workaround to achieve the end result that i would like to see  but i still believe the initial issue remains
no  the file is not within the minions_pre directory 
pymongo version is 3 1 1  just a note  job and returners logs is successfully being added to the mongodb for the job i initiated but the above error only pops up if i have a active job and run "salt run jobs active"
 jfindlay centos 6 7  saltstack 2015 5 5
thanks for making that clearer 
 ch3ll the template i am using doesn't have salt installed  until it is deployed by salt cloud  the key is created on the master just before the vm clone starts   i e  just before this line on the salt master   info   creating test3 from template templ     which is also before the deploy script  which installs salt  is run 
hi mike  that was my first thought  and so i added more memory  and the problem was solved  use  case a t2 micro instance in aws to test simple salt stuff with 3 minions  in the past this was never a problem    the 'thing' is that the error message was not very helpful  i  think' it would has been nice to see a out of memory error  make sense  as always thanks 
 jfindlay hi there  what i'm doing  is i'm starting a  cmd exe  c  process from c# with the following arguments    salt call event send 'customevent'      return local   out quiet  when the process terminates  i'm left with stdout response containing a json response  and i'm deserializing the json to obtain the jid  i figured out that much on my own  however i still have no idea how to check whether or not that particular job has completed failed is still running  any ideas  regards
 ssgward here is the produce
 jfindlay thanks for your reply  version  salt 2015 8 3 salt api 0 8 4 1 salt api config  only configure the user name and password post   http 1 1 host  localhost 8000 accept  application json x auth token  d40d1e1e content type  application x www form urlencoded fun cmd run client local tgt   arg c  powershell a ps1 return "error  sorry  windows does not support runas functionality" i want to execute powershell script on windows minion
we're running redhat 6 and last time we attempted that  yum was broken by the python version upgrade  we had to pin the salt repo at 2016 11 
the topfile sls is like   salt minions config is exactly like default  only changed the name of saltmaster host  
i'm not sure about the minion anymore  as i destroyed it last night  but both versions came from the  jessie  debian repository cited here  https   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation debian html both were installed over the weekend too  so they should be relatively up to date  i don't have the  drone  state anymore either i don't think  but i'm planning to give this another shot tonight  since the  docker formulas  failed me as well  albeit because of a bug in  systemd 215   and report back when if i hit this again 
hi   jfindlay  no  there is no   usr local etc salt states base packages sls   only   usr local etc salt states usermodel packages sls   still  i expect  sudo salt statlab100 rambler ru state apply packages  find packages as   usr local etc salt states usermodel packages sls  exist and file_roots contain the following 
 jfindlay here you are   i also just found that someone  mentioned  https   groups google com d msg salt users phum1snzlae v_dtu5wscgaj  something similar on the google group  but i didn't see any issues in this repo that looked related 
on a fresh machine with ubuntu 14 04 and only a salt minion bootstrapped i get
running salt ' ' pillar get 'key' does return the correct secret as i would expect  which leads me to believe that the boto_elb execution module does not render the pillar in the same way that the pillar execution module does  i can't provide an example of the pillar without sending my password  however creating any valid credential to aws should be able to reproduce this issue  for example in your pillar if you had a keyid gktadjgheiqsxmkkrbj08h and key askdjghsdfjkghwupujasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs this would work 
 jfindlay the configuration seems to be correct… as far as i can tell  i can query locations  images and sizes  applying the hack allows me to create the vm  provisioning seems to work too  since the vm is showing up as salt minion  i can also query the running vms  let me know if you need more information 
 ch3ll hi megan  here's the output you request   perhaps  raid list  should follow symbolic links to their source and then check to see if it matches the array name given in the state file  just a suggestion 
 ch3ll this would explain why it's not working on my installation since the version from the repo currently is 2015 8 8  thanks for the clarification   +1 
thanks  ch3ll so the challenge i have is trying to figure out how to upgrade my master and minion to a later version of salt  after pretty much an entire afternoon of attempting to do this i've basically managed to nuke my salt master and can't go backwards or forwards at this point so    yay  so i guess maybe if someone else can verify this is working in a later version then we can close this ticket off if it's expected not to work in 2015 5 3 and i'll muddle through trying to recover my master back to something that works again 
i'm trying to create a delegated config 'tree' by nesting one git repo inside another  so that a 'sub directory' of pillar config can be in a repo managed by someone else  this works fine for state sls files  following https   docs saltstack com en latest topics tutorials gitfs html  but not for pillars 
 ch3ll i do not have brew installed on the system  this issue persists after upgrading both minion and master to 2016 3 3
i switched from somewhere between  2016 3  and  2016 11  to  develop   and things broke  i rolled back to  2016 11   and things started working again  i may have made other changes at the time  i was somewhat frantically trying to fix things because i was doing this on a work night and it was already 1 am  i should be able to block out a larger chunk of time to do diagnostics and troubleshooting this weekend  it's probably worth noting for a lot of this that i'm  probably  not necessarily using salt the way most of the documentation seems to assume people will  i'm not interested in running saltstack as a stand alone tool  but rather using it as a component in a larger python script  as such  i'm not using the cli interface or the salt state config file thing at all  my interface script thing is here  https   github com fake name autotriever blob master marshaller salt_runner py  basically  i don't really have a use for a stand alone tool  i need something i can attach to a existing system and or scheduler  i'm actually not entirely sure how you're  supposed  to use the cli tool for automation  do you have python  or your other tooling  shell out to then call the various cli tools when automating things  that seems kinda silly if you're already python  basically  i've had to more or less guess and experiment to figure out how to use the python interface components  and as such  i'm  probably  doing things incorrectly  or at least making bad assumptions         a lot of this is exacerbated by the fact that apparently the depreciation warnings weren't actually attached to the thing that uses the depreciated arguments  so you can be happily using depreciated functionality without ever knowing any better 
 terminalmage i loop through all the local packages that are gathered with  local_pkgs   __salt__ 'pkg list_pkgs'  versions_as_list true    and use  __salt__ 'pkg version_cmp'  local  vulnerable   to compare the local version with a vulnerable version from an external source  gathered from the api at  vulners com  https   www vulners com api v3 search lucene  query type centos   the problem is that sometimes the version returned from vulners com has the epoch  other times it doesn't  so it would be nice if  pkg version_cmp  could handle the case of comparing versions where one version number has an epoch  while the other doesn't  again  it's not necessarily a bug or issue  more just a heads up  because if you didn't know any better and just compared the versions without checking whether they match in terms of both having epoch's or not  you could introduce a bug that might not be so obvious to spot 
 ch3ll thanks for your answer  did you try it with the cloud init file    etc network interfaces d 50 cloud init cfg   it only happens to me when that file is present even if that file is not sourced in  etc network interfaces

 twangboy i am using yosemite  cry    strictly 10 11 is too much  i'm afraid  10 11 is the pinnacle of the family  but i think there are lots of  yose mites out there  especially when you're running server stuffs  upgrading system were never a choice of free will 
yes  i guess you understand the docs correctly  i didn't know that job results with master_id are returned to that master only in a best effort fashion  but this can probably be easily alleviated by using a shared job cache  on the other hand events such as minion_start don't go to any job cache as they aren't even jobs  i may be talking rubbish now but i guess they are gone if you don't read them from the event buss at the time they arrive  for me forwarding such events just to any master is a bit pointless  as said previously  changing that behaviour is really easy  when _forward_events   parses self raw_events  https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt minion py#l2577  it can set master_id to ' ' or another special value which then can be treated appropriately by _call_syndic    https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt minion py#l2423   anyway guys  that is only my suggestion  i patched it myself and the least i can do is report it here so that the community may potentially benefit 
was basic rpm  qa command salt ssh  i target cmd run "rpm  qa   grep splunk"
 ch3ll   gave a shot  that piece of code resolves the issue on my end  need to see how to write tests for it

hey  sorry for the long absence  we had to switch from openldap to freeipa  but the issue still persists  i'm sending requests for generating keys for minions  i'm using a batch script together with salt bootstrap to install salt minion on servers  part of the installation process is to generate keys using salt api  so we have a group for approved administrators that should be able to generate keys  but this doesn't work with salt api for some reason  here's what i know so far   sudo curl  ssk https   saltmaster 8000 keys  d mid testminion1  d username user d password pass  d eauth pam  returns   also  not sure if it's relevant  but when i call  sudo curl  ssk https   saltmaster 8000 keys  d username user  d password pass  d eauth pam  to get a list of current minions  it return the same html as above  but if i login   sudo curl  ssk https   saltmaster 8000 login  d username user  d password pass  d eauth pam   and then use that token to list minions  it works  however this method doesn't work if i try to create a key 
yeah  looks like it is not there for all the sections  from what i tested  got the errors for autoscaling and loadbalancer  but security groups got created for ap south 1 
not many     but there was some weirdness in some of the configs and one was literally in an infinite highstate loop     noticed it by watching active jobs     that being said    i still see a lot of lag in the zeromq and i still haven't found any good guide on defining number of threads or size of salt master
hi  gtmanfred  an upgrade on my minion solved this issue   salt call 2014 1 13  hydrogen   to  salt call 2016 11 5  carbon     my full state is here if you want to take a look   http   paste debian net 952528 thanks  best regards  rémy
thanks  it works    +1 
 ch3ll thanks for responding  here is the information you needed  1  top sls  3  i believe this worked with the older version 2015 8 12 but i didn't try it with multiple environment  i have tried to follow salt stack cookbook to try to get this setup but it doesn't seem to work  4  didn't know about pillarenv variable  tried the  sudo salt 'staging3 manager01 ui' state apply   saltenv staging3 pillarenv staging3  command and it seems to work ok  thanks  my assumption is that if i specify staging3 environment  only pillar files from staging3 environments should be sourced  is this not a correct assumption 
starting at line 822 in the win_service py there is the def create      about 200 lines under that at line 1011 is the code i am speaking of  it tests if the service already exists  if it does it returns an exception  it in the salt modules folder
sorry here you go https   github com saltstack salt pull 37135
 gtmanfred thank you i will try upgrading to a newer version of salt but the environment will be a test the 2015 5 is used in our production environment so it coundn't see this problem again 
 garethgreenaway this is the relevant portion of one of the state runs that is exhibiting this behavior

sure it does  anything to help see the reasons for failures would help 
 mirceaulinic is  get_local_client  not for creating a  file_client  local  salt client 
let me grab and sanitize some logs for you  can you elaborate more on what isolating the salt minion process looks like using systemd  my problem wasn't a service system killing off the salt minion process  it was the salt minion successfully upgrading the  salt minion  package within a state  and then failing with a stacktrace on subsequent python functionality within the same run  where the internal api of salt changed between versions  although i realize that the stack itself is cosmetic relating to the outputter  it does end the salt call run  which is impactful 
no   i have not change anythink in that environment no matter i run which command  it will get the same error
hi   gtmanfred  i can change  verify_certs  to  true   but i don't think i can change the value of  ca_certs  to  none  by passing 'none' in  because it the module will treat that argument as a string 
sorry to reply late i couldn't drag files to here so i push source file to the repository https   github com qiangshui saltfile git  and i don't know if those files are what you want my english is too bad to understand your meaning  apologize agin  if the "source file" you mean are those i want to transfer to the minions then they are in the "sourcefile" of the repository that i mentioned above or if you mean the source file of saltstack then they are in the other 3 directories  these 3 directories are from  usr lib python2 6 site packages salt  thanks for your help   ch3ll
hi  silvenga   from a root user shell   i don't think that is a permission problem because if i try to install firefox package with pkg install it works without problems 
https   en wikipedia org wiki virtual_router_redundancy_protocol a method to pass a floating ip between active and passive server  no need for anything fancy  adding a  32 ip to eth0 on the "primary" server  let minions connect  remove that ip from the primary and add to a secondary  which has the same master pub pem files and wait for minion to reconnect  either takes long time  or prints the errors above 
no  the problem is that the grains are not stored "under" vmhost at all  they all go to the proxy minion  where they are not really handled correctly  i e  overwrite instead of append  but this is not the main problem   i updated my examples to better reflect that  and yes  it all works correctly if i target regular minion 
yes this does work thanks  but this is more or less just a workaround  because i can't be sure that the inline comments are still there  so a regex matching  exit 0  should be better because the file has to end with this  isn't it also better if there is a option to activate multiline mode  like "flags" which are deprecated 
sorry  i forgot to add the file  i added them right before  this line  https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt utils cloud py#l942   my  etc salt master file has these lines    the rest are commented out  i didn't change anything in master configuration but this probably explains why my script is running as "salt" user 
hi  gtmanfred  no i didn't  setting that option to  true  or  false  makes no difference 
hi  garethgreenaway  its all on the same host  i think the following is the offending code  https   github com saltstack salt blob cb6cfcc5945cc66c9e675b2777dde8591eedd20d salt client ssh __init__ py#l408 l410 i'm guessing  if i target an ip address and ptr points to hostname that points to a different ip  i would connect to that second ip  that is frankly a terrible behavior 
works perfectly  thanks 
i just submitted a pr  https   github com saltstack salt pull 47409 never have before  so let me know if any additional information is needed 
it's added over the default config  but well i reinstalled the salt master and now it's working  not sure what the reason was  issue can be closed  thanks

hi  gtmanfred   pull request in  against 2017 7  i have to admit  it's a quick fix that seems to work for me   i didn't review the whole pip_state py logic to see if it was an ideal solution though 
yup essentially  also all subsequent ldap connections for that job  should use the bind credentials if specified   i noticed that if a minion is taking too long  the authentication will get re attempted via a  time_auth  https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt auth __init__ py#l101  function  i added a check here for the existence of the show_jid key in the payload  https   github com saltstack salt pull 42426 files#diff 8aa8a7beb3814d772c1830930f3927a9r393 this only gets passed through the initial payload for the job so i am keying off that to determine whether it's the first auth attempt or a later one 
using test fail_without_changes worked like a charm for me  thank you    
i have added group present state  thx
this issue is to request support for files with extension   yaml  because its a data exchange format  people and projects can release software with bunch of yamls and people can use salt  ansible  or programmatic stuff to consume those files   they can add jinja2 and gpg secrets too 
tested using 2017 7 4 first applying  network is configured correctly  no exceptions thrown 
 gtmanfred thanks  should be good with #42693

 gtmanfred    ps aux   grep salt minion  shows only one  salt minion  process sorry   i just realized that i said 'ports' in my comment  when i meant 'ips'  so there is one master  but who listens on two distinct ips  i had a look at  netstat  on the minion and i see two connections going to the master 
this is the exception 
changed top sls in this way  nothing changed  the key from global try had been overwriting as the last time  also i tried to change order of directory viewing in  pillar_roots   in  master  it doesn't work and it was expected because in exactly this way pillars work according to  pillar namespace flattening  https   docs saltstack com en latest topics pillar #pillar dictionary merging   in my case i'd like to have keys in  try  not overwritten from  base   now i have to have all hosts in  base  
#45334 this one does not look relevant to me  the workaround in that one was to avoid using yaml list lines  i'm not using them  however  i have tried the opposite just for fun and it still fails  #42735 this one also appears to be a yaml listing issue  which i'm not doing

i digged more code at minion side   c  salt bin lib site packages salt states win_system  love the cleanness of python  so i got "win_system" listed finally with the "salt minion sys list_state_modules 'win_ '" command  the "fix" was to comment out the line " __virtualname__   'system' "  although now i understand that i should have called " system" not " win_system"  but this is not so obvious as i expected this list  https   docs saltstack com en latest ref states all index html to match "salt minion sys list_state_modules" command   which would be as salt wants to be   simple and direct  though yes under the specific page after the huge headline "salt states win_system" there indeed is example codeblock with "system computer_name    "    but i needed reboot  so i always scroolled down and copied "salt states win_system reboot" to my code  case closed   lesson learned   problem solved for me  but i don't think such confusion for newcomers is only this module or windows specific and maybe it should be addressed  so if module uses __virtualname__   'system'   then the  ref  webpage for this module also shows lines addresably as "salt states system reboot"

hi  gtmanfred   unfortunately that doesn't work  the output is   thanks  hanna
as far as i know  no manual activity caused this  this looks like the beginning  there don't seem to be any earlier messages   sorry  i could've added that right at the start  hope this helps 
hi  i am not sure i understand the question  i am talking about  this feature  https   docs saltstack com en latest ref states requisites html#retrying states   to my understanding the retry feature is implemented in the code calling the state functions but not directly within the state functions  that's visible in those log lines   also  it obviously does a retry but the retry in this case is only related to the checksum verification but not the download  this makes the feature pointless somehow   
on the node i'm testing on      returns nothing  so looks like they are most likely all  ppc64le  no  noarch  packages  i looked in the install repo directory as well and they all look to be the same 
 garethgreenaway i revisited this with fresh eyes after the weekend  i now believe the proper solution is to simply change  https   github com saltstack salt blob b44f0f1d0fd564690c6e45c6dd061c0e84d76def salt returners odbc py#l244 to   the issue is that fetchone   returns an array with a single item in it  i failed to notice the above change that my coworker had made   the string coercion was simply a red herring 
done but not sure why it's failing the windows tests

i think i found the problem is with logging  and when i run the above code  somehow salt client prevent flask and werkzeug from logging  the server is up now  but no logging  i followed this  issue  https   github com saltstack salt issues 4994  but it doesn't help
sorry my bad  i put the wrong cobbler url on conf file 
we've noticed a number of hosts lose salt connectivity  despite being reachable via ssh  this occasionally predicts localized network outages  our systems team wrote a check for the monitoring system using a ping to check for responsive hosts 
yes  i configured the interface is  127 0 0 1
i'm afraid this is not the only package affected  i searched the saltstack ubuntu repository for more duplicates and found the following conflicts  only precise trusty xenial bionic latest paths    md5sum os packagename   on reverse dependend packages  which themselves probably must also increase in version then    but it would be nice if someone with more debian packaging knowledge could verify this 
 ch3ll i've done the easy bit  i'm not planning to rewrite it to  import venv   i'm also not sure how whether it can still be set via minion config  or whether someone wants to put that in 
any  x509 certificate_managed  state with  ca_server   such as the documentation examples 
hi  garethgreenaway  the salt master is running 
just wanted to say thank you  as soon as i added 'parrot'  debian'  under kali everything is working fine  i don't know how to make a pr  pull requst  as i'm very new to git myself  i just wanted to say thank you   3
ok i was vague as it seems more involved than i first thought  i have some  include  s happening in the pillar and it looks like this  https   github com nocturo pillar if you put that as your ext_pillar  with root 
sure  if you want  but i don't see the point  the problem is not in salt code  it's in the docs for mysql returner  specifically  
yeah  ponysay outside of salt works correctly  shows some lovely colour graphics and stuff  however  i've found a fix that seems very easy  in the check_output call  if you add universal_newlines true  then it works correctly 
i've tried following code   so   regex_match  currently seems to work very similar to  startswith 
confirmed label is included in this merged pr  https   github com saltstack salt pull 55626 files
no  it was from rpm  the line numbers might be off because i was adding code to debug  on tue  apr 16  2019  2 01 pm zer0def  notifications github com  wrote 
what you see above under configuration file is what i have in the schedule file  to clarify myself  the issue is not that command didn't work  the expected behavior is to provide all of the fields found in schedule present and only modify what needs to be  what i tried to do was to only include fields i want to modify  for example  if i run schedule present name job1 function test ping once 2019 04 18t20 00 00 once_fmt  y  m  dt h  m  s  if i want to modify "once" field i have to include all fields and modify only what i need as such  schedule modify name job1 function test ping once 2019 05 10t22 00 00 once_fmt  y  m  dt h  m  s  if i only do schedule modify name job1 once 2020 01 01t22 00 00 it fails with the above unhandled exception 
 waynew thanks， i tried install a new salt master on another system and its works well。 seems some system config or kernel config is modified， maybe  etc pam conf？
i will try to find some time tomorrow to upgrade and see     seems like it very well might be 
 dwoz hi  thank you for your responce  the 'salt ssh' has setted up on the local manjaro host from wich i try to install packets on the remote opensuse host  so the salt stack is absent on the remote host  i faced issue with opensuse 42  with opensuse 15 script works 
it kept printing every few seconds  i had a backup of my old config and and diff showed only one difference which was max_threads  commenting it out and restart fixed it  the only special point in my config is external pillars 
yes  this problem needs to be fixed in several places where    force confnew  is used
no  each time i try reading this pillar in the module  it never returns the right value  if i fetch it from the command line  i get the right value   however  the same command within the module never gets the pillar value and in turn returns only the default value  wonder why is that 
i am able to reproduce this with cisco nx os devices consistently using netmiko proxy with always_alive   true  1  start the proxy
i have updated the original post with the output of salt   versions report  our environment uses ksh by default  yeah  don't ask why  but even with my own machine that runs bash by default i am getting the same results  thanks 
mainly i want to use password authentication  but both is also nice
ah sorry  m2crypto is installed on the minion  the states that require m2crypto work well  that means the ca is being generated  just to be sure i now installed m2crypto on the salt master as well  but that does not change the outcome  i guess what  orangedog is saying is correct  that is also what the blog entry on backbeat tech says about  module run  
i can certainly dig some up for you 
 soininen  i've submitted the pull request already and i am waiting for review  i think  that the label 'in progress' is for that pull requests which should not be reviewed yet 
 martyngigg i have pushed some changes doing something similar for the window and toolbar  this would need careful testing if we go with this approach  it is hard to reliably get all the correct things to wrap  i am not sure if there are other things that could generate this error  presumably if you can get to other widget items  buttons in the toolbar perhaps   you could get the same errors 
 spencerhowells  fair enough point  i think that we could just block these functions completely  as it stands a user could mistakenly add the function and bring the whole code crashing down  we certainly need to stop this happening
