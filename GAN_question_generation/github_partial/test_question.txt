why do you think this is not a bug  are those two files symlinks to one another 
can you elaborate on why you would want it to behave differently 
why is that undesirable 
does this still happen  we've fixed a few monomorphization related bugs recently 
can we implement a stopgap c_vec module now that would make writing this kind of code more convenient 
would anyone be willing to mentor should i need it 
maybe i'm missing something  though 
can you provide some more information about how to set this up  i am not familiar with debootstrap 
why do people dislike them so much  i love being able to write
does that build include the fix in https   github com mozilla rust pull 13043 
why would you use two ports in place of a port with an enum message like    
what would you think we ought to suggest 
could we respin a 0 3 1 for this 
how will we refer to      and       logical and and logical or 
documenting std should definitely not be trying to document rustc_errors    can you gist the output with   v  as well 
should we rename  v1  to  edition2015  and add an alias for it  then the compiler can just plug in the edition year into the path 
couldn't the function be made public 
might it be that  lockfileex  requires  file_write_data  
do you have a testcase that reproduces this problem  also  what version of rustc are you using 
does this happen on  nix  windows  or either 
did you run  make clean  after updating recently 
could you paste the errors that you're seeing as well 
what are the types of vert position  joint position  and rot_pos 
does anybody have any ideas about what we should do here 
can we amend this to test or docs only changes    
do you happen to have a brief  or not so brief  piece of code that demonstrates this issue 
what do you suggest 
what's the output from the compiler when it fails 
why is this disallowed 
shouldn't related modules be nested in submodules rather than logically ordered in the source  finding things in long non ordered lists is a real pain 
why isn't  span_lint  in context good enough 
what if the user imports a name using  as    e g   use std  io  fs  file as phile   should the error message be displayed with the changed name  or the original name 
should we add one  presumably there would be quite a few of them 
could you try with the latest master 
what should be the better warning message here  or i just need to remove the last sentence 
what do you mean "doesn't mention the apostrophe"  that it doesn't mention that  '  introduces a lifetime 
does it compile if you remove that 
could you also give the revision of rust http that demonstrates this 
what is the file name of the program you are running   i have a feeling this may be because of #7188 and or #7225  
can you capture any information about the segfault  perhaps a debugger backtrace 
can you confirm that using the raw  stat  in c shows the number of blocks changing 
can you run  git rev parse head   the build may not be likely to succeed on netbsd but the configure should at least succeed because  we have configuration for it  https   github com rust lang rust blob master mk cfg x86_64 unknown netbsd mk  
what version of the compiler were you using  this looks like it's probably fixed on master right now 
should they be   can reopen if that is the purpose of this issue 
do you have a  reasonably  small self contained example crate for this 
what happens if you add this right before you read from stdin 
can you provide a paste of the full session  the  rustllvm  library should have be automatically rebuilt   
did you get much of a handle on it   epdtry if you have any spare cycles over the christmas break  we would appreciate a fix    
why does rust started emitting atomic instructions on msp 
would it work out if the impls were just sorted apart  rather than giving an entirely new section heading to "negative impls"  that might be easier to implement 
maybe  vec truncate  could use  std  intrinsics  needs_drop   t     to decide if the loop is needed 
can you provide the code that triggers the assertion as well  ideally minimized as well  but we can attempt to do that as well 
can this be back ported to beta pls  ping  alexcrichton
why should  drop  be the only trait in existence that can't be used as a bound 
what’s the  dx  
can you put the code in a github repo instead so i can browse it and clone it 
what if the c string is in some non utf8 encoding but the bytes happen to be identical to a utf 8 string 
can you test with a more recent nightly and see if this still reproduces  otherwise looks like this is a candidate for beta backport as well 
could we make some kind of interactive rustfix tool to let you choose new lifetime names and have them automatically updated 
what version of mingw do you have  along with the version of gcc 
what is the error 
how does this interact with nul termination 
what functionality do you need want 
what needs clarification 
can you include the code  what os are you running  i e  what's the output of  rustc   version   verbose   
what version of rust are you using  i think this error was fixed fairly recently  cc  michaelwoerister
what version of windows were you on  i think you said on irc you used a nightly  which one 
do you have a   cargo config  somewhere that is influencing things  it's the most common cause of rust failing to build for me 
can it not map to the  json  enum 
which nightly is servo on  i can't reproduce on playpen  https   play rust lang org  gist c18f53f98345751eb4afe3ac59ffc73e version stable
do you have an error message or ice you can share with us 
does this issue reproduce if you run  make clean  first 
do you suggest giving the  formatter  the  path  directly  and do the non unicode sequence conversion in the  formatter  
do you have by chance a backtrace    
should the definition of  add  not be more like  this  https   play rust lang org  gist 0d840680345dfa99c4e4 version stable   note the extra lifetime  'b   or is that impossible in the real implementation 
do you see any problem with it  i'm very ok with this behaviour if the compiler is like  "you should  use std  foo  bar  trait "
what sort of crash are you getting  panic  segfault   how can we reproduce it 
do you want to make a pr to fix this 
where are the tests for this  could try to write a fix 
do you have an idea of how to fix this  i'm not sure what makes the most sense  exactly 
can someone tell me 
how 
maybe a clippy lint would be appropriate here  something like "same lifetime names" seems reasonable  cc  manishearth
do we have an eta for this 
should the returned pointer be a  nonnull  instead   box  raw  doesn’t do that because it was stabilized before  nonnull  was 
maybe it's linked to https   github com rust lang rust issues 65840   if so  it's not in rustdoc but below 
would it be sufficient to add  # must_use   to the definition  in the code block  here  http   doc rust lang org std result enum result html
how does that work 
what are some appropriate wordings  fn signature  fn  fn type  revert this one back to just type 
could you move this issue over there  we are trying to keep this issue tracker focused on actionable bugs accepted features 
could you give the code at least 
could you try to give an example that causes the ice  cc  nikomatsakis
what in particular is wrong with that sentence 
would this api be cross platform  and if so  how would it be implemented on windows 
how is the compiler handling such a case  if we could use the same in rustdoc  that'd be even better than warn about it 
can you think of a suggestion to improve the clarity 
could you try to build rust from source with llvm asserts on     enable llvm assertions  to    configure   and perhaps see what the assert is 
when can we expect this to be usable from stable 1 2 
why hasn't this been caught while 1 27 0 was in beta 
what version of rust are you using  for me this doesn't overflow 
can you reproduce on the current rust nightly 
should  exactsize  panic if the underlying iterator fails to yield exactly  size  values  should  sizehint  panic if the underlying iterator fails to yield at least  lower  values 
maybe it would be sufficient to pretty print the json for now 
what specific problems are you seeing 
maybe your api should be generic or take an iterator 
would it be "easy enough" to move these impls up to  core  num   if privacy or something gets in the way we can reconsider reverting perhaps 
could you give more context 
can you post the ice message and backtrace 
can you obtain backtrace using gdb or lldb 
does it happen without codegen units option 
can you upload the full output of    configure  and  make   
which version did you try with 
how'd you verify this  i tried a few variants myself and it looks like it works 
do you have some code that exhibits this failure mode  without a reproduction it's tough to see what's going on here 
can you please check whether the issue is fixed in nightly 
could this be related to thinlto + multiple codegen units 
can this issue be closed considering the pr was merged 
does this occur with 1 2  if it does  could you post some code that reproduces that bug 
should be   cfg meta  i guess  right 
could you   c llvm args  print before all  
what's some good docs on what   errorlevel   is  i don't use windows that much myself   cc  retep998
maybe that's the case for all distro builds if the distro has separate debuginfo packages 
could the patches for llvm be merged upstream perhaps  that way we'd just pick up compatibility automatically 
could you file this in https   github com rust lang cargo instead 
what os are you on 
what about  cfg any stage0  stage1  stage2     😄  btw is  this piece of code in  src bootstrap bin rustdoc rs   https   github com rust lang rust blob 380100c568c1c390c837caf98338d07c4d8a0462 src bootstrap bin rustdoc rs#l44 l49  just an oversight from #42495  
do you have  security tls version max  in  about config  set to 1 or something other than 3 
can you check your development console  maybe  it looks to me like the css didn't get loaded 
should the different alignment values lead to this error  you could try putting clang's datalayout in your json file to see if it helps 
do you mean generated rustdoc is corrupted  if so  this is a duplication of https   github com rust lang rust issues 25879 
can you provide a minimal repro as a regression test 
which url did you use 
could this be the same issue as https   github com rust lang rust issues 37893 
does that help 
what's your rust version  the program does not compile on current stable  beta  or nightly playground 
maybe some sort of diagnostic is in order 
can you try opening   root  multirust toolchains nightly x86_64 unknown linux gnu lib rustlib etc gdb_rust_pretty_printing py  and changing the  if sys version_info major    3   to  if sys version_info 0     3    that should be compatible with more versions of python 
what's the last error you see in the example 
maybe we could try to show the expanded code though  i'm not 100  sure if that'd work though 
should closures be defining uses  or just uses  and thus only be able to return that type by calling a function that defines the existential  
could you show the output of    message format json   the only thing i can think of is that there's a  dummy_sp  span that isn't being displayed 
wouldn't this defeat the purpose of linkcheck 
why doesn't it make sense  in theory  u32  could  implement these traits and as such be a conflicting impl  so rust doesn't allow you to write it at all 
which commit causes the assertion failure  is it the latest one  e36e120  
do you have access to the build directory as well  if so  can you gist the contents of  x86_64 apple darwin rt llvmdeps rs  
can we maybe get a standalone example that doesn't use  clang  
can this be implemented by jemalloc or libc malloc  it seems like a trait that would be defined by the fallback allocator crate 
can you check this with the latest nightly  this should have been fixed with the removal of the built in macros crate  cc  petrochenkov
what build options are you using 
how does this interact with  drop   and how are foreign functions expected to allocate  using rust's allocator  the boxed memory 
can you test in the latest nightly build 
could you try reinstalling rust 
do you know if this is a recent regression  or did this always happen  cc  ssomers in any case
could you open an issue there 
could you provide the full log by chance 
could you post this on internals rust lang org please  we try to keep the issue tracker for bugs only 
can you post the full benchmark code  both the iterator and non iterator versions   that would help with testing locally and trying to find the problem 
would you send a pr and ping me for review   as an aside  we should probably have ci on rust lang rust that libcore at least compiles for one 16 bit platform  
could you try running  cargo update   i suspect that  petrochenkov fixed this in slog here https   github com slog rs slog pull 139    cc tracking issue https   github com rust lang rust issues 34537 
how would a "proper error" be issued  what would the form of that error be 
why do you want to make assertions about the size of a struct with an  instant  in it 
how wrong am i  is   o1  unacceptable for some reason  do we need more fine grained flags to achieve a   o2size but 0speed  sort of build 
do you see the same result without  unreachable_unchecked   because i don't think you're allowed anything but  asm  in a naked function 
would you mind opening this issue over at https   github com rust lang nursery rustup rs  that's the proper repo for rustup 
would you be interested in sending a pr 
what does the function you're calling recv in return 
do you mean  foo  bar  is accessible from other crates  then it looks like a bug   bar  shouldn't be accessible anywhere outside of  macro impl_mod  
can future  cargobomb  runs be updated to use the latest version 
can you reproduce the issue using rustc _stable_  
does this help  https   doc rust lang org rustdoc the doc attribute html#testattr

when installing vc++ did you remember to install the windows sdk component 
what behavior do you expect for the  impl from  'static str  for test  impl  it's recursing into itself through the   into    method  exc_bad_access is how stack overflows are reported 
does this mean that you do  not  see the error on stable  are you able to provide a test case 
can someone confirm 
can you try on nightly  we recently fixed a rustdoc ice  i wonder if it's similar

can you explain what you mean by oddly  they are listed as re exports 
how did you install rust 
can you provide a function  playground that reproduces the errors 
can you provide that 
could you check whether it reproduces on nightly  it could be fixed by the pr making  duplicate_macro_exports  an error  https   github com rust lang rust pull 65785  
how would the compiler know how to perform the unsizing operation  all existing impls are built into rustc because it has to know how to perform them

can you check if this reproduces with the latest nightly 
does this reproduce on nightly 
does this also happen on nightly 
can you open this issue in https   github com rust lang rust instead 
what's your use case for this  these apis might be replaced in the future  and libstd might stop using os primitives for this completely 
could you provide reproducible example 
does this also happen on nightly 
could you post  rustc  vv  and nightly version which has worked before 
can you explain more the process  not sure i followed  for example  run this curl script  then start x  then stop  then restart  yada yada yada   
could you check your java settings 
can i please table the idea that such changes are best communicated through the specification itself   perhaps with the adoption of an attribute    as opposed to an out of band mechanism 
can you provide a recreation  i am assuming you are using the in memory index 
can you share how you provided the parameters  the exec line  something along those lines   
which version of elasticsearch are you using 
can you send me one of those broken windows debian packages so i can check out that specific one 
could you please elaborate a little more on what behaviour you currently see and what you would like to see instead 
do you still have the problem 
can you try and check it down  maybe paste the result of adding an  echo  to the invocation of java in the  plugin bat  
can you give me an example how big they are 
do you delete data in your indexing code  also  what do you mean a new index being referenced  can you share your indexing code 
did you run into problems with it 
can't you simply close the index  update the settings  and then open it again  i missed the part where open loops  cause its already opened  no 
can you gist the full stack trace of the failure that you get 
which version are you using 
can you gist the full stack trace that you get  also  can you check the logs of the server and see if there are failures there 
did you try   http   localhost 9200 _plugin head   
do you know what the core failure is here 
does this happens in 0 20 
can you set loglevel in logging yml to debug and check the logfile  not the console output  for a stack trace in order to get more information 
may i ask what is your usecase here and why this is a problem 
do you wanna come up with a pr 
can you confirm 
may be we can now merge it in master 
what are you issues with excluding it 
can you explain what you are doing exactly  i mean are you downloading the 0 90 release from here  http   www elasticsearch org download  and then unzip   untar and run  bin elasticsearch  f   
would that make sense 
can you share the nodes info output with the thread_pool flag and your thread pool configuration

where are the 'unofficial rpm' spec files  so i could take a look and verify 
could you post here the portion of the cluster state with the information about the snapshot 
what is the purpose of returning null here 
what do you think  wanna open a pr for this 
do the mapping of the documents being percolated contain nested object types 
which version are you using  also  prefer not to set  index fielddata cache  to  soft   instead  set  indices fielddata cache size  to bound it by size 
can you identify if that is abnormal 
what gives the following 
can we get more of the stacktrace for this error   do you know when this happens 
would you be up for sending a pr that fixes the docs 
why did you add the parameter to the throwable 
what version of es are you running  can we have more info about your logs

can you tell what your test is doing or maybe even share it 
can you use  _msearch  with  search_type count  
do you still have by chance the oom exception in the logs  maybe we didn't catch it properly somewhere 
what was in your logs  can you reproduce this 
do you search across several indices  can you check the mapping for each index  if it contains a  geo_point  for the  location  field 
does the end user need to know this  yes  warn is the right level  we are ignoring settings a user thinks they have set  we absolutely should warn them 
do you have any other data where this happens with  or is it just this single polygon  thanks a lot for all your input 
do you want to take this 
does that make sense 
may i ask you to post these types of question on our  mailing list  https   groups google com forum  fromgroups # forum elasticsearch   it seems more appropriate unless you find issues in elasticsearch itself that we need to fix 
do you have stored fields  what does your mapping look like 
can you elaborate on this a little bit  imo they just depend on the analyzer   can you maybe show what the problem is as an example 
did you specify sorting  the  track_scores  feature only has effect when defining  sort  in the search request 
could you expand on what you're trying to achieve 
what exactly are you trying to encoded  more than just the simple string example you have here    could you encode the data as multiple parameters 
what is your use case exactly  for instance a segment file could be very recent even if no documents were indexed if a shard was relocated 
did you check the output of your sync flush command  were all shards synced as expected 
could you explain in more detail please 
do you see any corresponding exceptions on the nodes where primaries for the failed shards where located  if you do  could you provide complete exception stack traces 
did you edit the error message  what do you refresh to check 10th shard  which command are you running 
can you tell us more about the version of elasticsearch that you are using and how you configure mappings  are you using dynamic mappings or do you configure them explicitely  
would that help you 
would that work for you 
could you provide the stack trace from the logs so that we can investigate further  thanks
which version of es do you use  can describe a little more where and how you get the exception 
could you provide the code that you are using to run your search requests 
why do you need this feature  what's the problem with  description value text  instead of  description value_text  
do you have a recreation script i can run to show the bug 
could you provide the smallest recreation of the problem that you can come up with  will help with debugging  thanks  martijnvg sounds like it could be a problem with top hits

can you provide a snapshot if the data is not too sensitive or help us creating a dataset that reproduces the problem 
could you try again please 
which would be your preference  specifying them inline as per your example or composability 
how did you install elasticsearch  is the  lib  directory containing the elasticsearch jar in   es_home lib   does the current user have access to it 
can you give more information about your use case  i would be interested to know more about the big picture to see how we can improve elasticsearch to address your needs 
would that be an option 
could you share a  pom xml  which does not work so we can reproduce your issue 
could this be improved by disabling scoring  i assume that most of the cost is building the bitset for all docs minus those which have the field 
what version of es 
can you provide the output from _cat shards 
how many docs are you missing  how is the index created  can you provide more infos 
could you provide more info please 
how would you provide weights for each of the terms 
do you think there is a way to work around this temporarily 
do you override any of the setup   teardown methods 
does that make sense 
can you share your settings 
however what do you want to know here  if double quotes can be used in  node name  
what is your server version  is it exactly the same version for the client  this field exists in 1 7  https   github com elastic elasticsearch blob 1 7 src main java org elasticsearch script groovy groovyscriptengineservice java#l62

can you provide the output of  curl  s 'http   localhost 9200 _nodes stats human fields   pretty'  for me to take a look at 
could you provide a full recreation which demonstrates the data you have  the queries you are running  and what doesn't work as you expect 
what do you mean exactly with consistency  can you give a concrete example 
may be we should document that in https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current modules snapshots html   imotov wdyt 
would it need to be in timestamp form 
would you be able to provide any additional details about the nature of how it's not working  are there any error or log messages that you can share 
should we mark this as adoptme

how did you upgrade  it looks like you have lucene jars from es 2 1 on your classpath 
can you give a recreation  putting documents and running the two queries   do you see the same problem when using a simple query like  match_all  
can you maybe share some code where you would like to set the header 
can you ask such questions on discuss elastic co please  we keep this place only for confirmed issues

what do you think of that 
what happens when you remove the ridiculously high search thread pool 
which plugins do you have installed  where did you obtain them from  and how did you install them 
what do you think should happen if  for a given shard  all the nodes that you've marked as eligible for hosting a primary shard have died 
which branch are you trying to build  our tests are green on the 2 x end 
can you provide us with a simple recreation of the issue so that we can look into it 
could you try with java8 and see what happens 
may be you should ask there 
can you elaborate more with your configuration and what you actually see as output that indicates to you they are not included transitively 
can anything in your problem   how you recovered explain this  are you running on a shared failed system by any chance 
what version are you using  also  if you run the suggestion on just the 4 indices that are different  what happens 
what are you trying to do using this method 
can you please ask your question in our  discuss forum  https   discuss elastic co c elasticsearch   we reserve github issues for bugs and feature requests  thanks 
does this work for you 
can you say which guide you're referring to that specifies you can set these at the node level 
can you also add the logs output 
do you have evidence to the contrary 
can you provide a full  elasticsearch yml  file as a gist  you can replace all key secret values obviously but please keep the format untouched

can you confirm if you can run this in your environment  this might help draw out any issues relating to your environment 
can you share your mapping please 
can i have a look into it  tvernum  
could you try doing this with the  term  suggester instead  that might shed some light on the issue 
how are the scroll times that large to begin with  that's a cumulative scroll time of at least 292 277 266 years  that is  maybe there is something else going on here 
can you open it there  i am sure that  polyfractal will take a look then  thanks so much 
can you please double check that you're on 5 2 2  and even check on 5 3 0  does this reproduce  without  search guard 5 installed 
did i miss something in your example that triggers the problem  
when will this bug fix  thanks in advance
how many indices do you have and how large are your mappings  the size of  get _cluster state  might be interesting to know as well 
would you be interested in submitting your patch as a pull request 
what is the  salary  type in your mappings 
can you clarify how you've installed elasticsearch  it looks like you've installed it from the tar gz archive  and created a systemd service unit yourself 
what version is it and what do the queries that should be cached but are not look like  is the index read only 
could you see what the value of   indices pest total get total  is 
do you mean that the higher you set  size  in the reindex request  the more likely it is to finish without this failure 
can you explain the context of this in a bit more detail 
how did you install elasticsearch 5 6 2     did you upgrade an existing installation    did you install from a   zip     tgz  or   rpm

what information do you store in it and how do you use that information 
could you assign me please 
do you have any logging to support your hypothesis 
can you share the details of the usages that you plan to make of this new filter  
does this help

can you try it 
did you set the appropriate baud rate 
does the ide crash when you open a lot of files  or is there some bug that is triggered by having a lot of files open when the ide crashes 
does that make any difference 
where is your platform local txt 
does that mean something 
may you enable verbose upload  from preferences  and copy and paste output from both 1 0 5 and 1 5 x 
may you enable the verbose compile  from preferences  and copy the error  c
which board have you selected in the "boards" menu 
can you elaborate  i know gradle by the name but nothing more
can you attach your preferences txt  
shouldn't we just wrap the bare code 
did you retried  or can you retry now 
what do you mean with "link" 
what does the ide doe differently to _not_ get this error  afaics it just calls avr gcc as well  right 
maybe experimenting with the pullup resistors might help  peter olson
can you copy paste the content of the "additional boards manager urls" field in preferences 
did you find solution 
can you add details  for example  what do you do  what do you expect to happen and what actually happens

could you provide a more concrete example  something we can use to reproduce the issue 
what's the goal of this report  do you think things are unclear  or do you have suggestions on how to better handle this  do you think there is a bug 
can i see it being broken anywhere  the fix you propose looks good to me  care to submit a pullrequest for it 
which os do you use  i was able to install it both in win7 and win8
do you have 10g available  do other java applications work with that configuration 
which can be the best way to expose this in your opinion 
what permission was incorrect  i have the same problem on macos at 1 6 10
did you mean to say 1 0 6   that ide does not support the yún  the due and the yun are t main reasons behind the 1 5 x ide
where this file is expected to be  in the root folder of the zip file  together with the  arduino  executable  
could you post a full  but minimal  sketch that shows the problem  i wonder if your program might be triggering undefined behaviour that just accidentally works in previous gcc versions 
what board are you using  what board have you selected in the ide  can you paste the full  verbose  upload output 
can you please confirm you hardware wiring 
where i can find the library rbl_nrf8001 to check this

does programming the board work without the tinkerkit shield 
does that clarify 
can you paste the command line you use to upload verify without the    board  option 
could you enable verbose upload  it seems related to https   github com golang go issues 17182  maybe a rebuild of the tool with a recent version of golang may fix it 
would you mind opening a pr with this fix so we can merge it directly giving you the right attribution  thanks 
can you clarify a bit more why you think this would need to be changed 
does it get populated   sp_get_lib_version_string  api doesn't get explicitly called by the ide  it's quite strange it appears in your stacktrace 
does 1 8 5 work  or also fail  you might also try temporarily disabling any anti virus software  and windows defender  sometimes these cause trouble 
did you try the  hourly build  https   www arduino cc en main software#hourly  of the arduino ide  because that feature was added 3 weeks ago  https   github com arduino arduino pull 7549
could you test latest hourly and check if it also happens there  thanks a lot 
would you mind sharing a little poc to demonstrate the issue  thanks

did you install any non standard font  thanks for reporting 
which arduino board are you using  tolletrolden 
does that help  do u need an example 
what version of sequelize are you using 
could you please provide a real code example so we can try to narrow down your issue 
shouldn't it be    because if your column is nullable  then your query will return results 
what node mysql version are you using alongside sequelize 
how come your dialect will specifically be set to undefined  i would suggest doing  delete options dialect  before you call the sequelize constructor
which version are u using 
how are you fetching the jointable   please show us the find get call  
what's the result if you run this query manually 
could you format the code please 
can you be more detailed about your scenario 
what version are you on  regardless  orms will always add overhead  but specifically you can optimize performance by not using sequelize defined default values and not using includes 
how does it fail  please provide the test case as a pr
what does your model definition look like  what does the data look like  what does modelinstance datavalues look like before saving 
can you point to a specific piece of code that does this    success  is not a promise thing  so i don't see why any promise utilizing lib would use that 
what version are you using 
how would that work  or do you mean that it's "cached" on the table  i usually just do a hook and an increment for that type of stuff 
could you please also share your model definitions 
can you point to any reading material on bound parameters being inheritently more secure than framework escaping 
can you create a pr with a unit test  then i can fix this for you in a few hours 
does it work on dev11 or master   dev8 is quite old  might be older than the 1 7 0 stable release 
what version are you using 
however there have been some bugs previously that were fixed on 2 0 0  what version are you using 
did you read the changelog      the defaults should be in the first argument under  defaults 
can you describe a case you need this for 
can you move this issue to https   github com sequelize doc please    
could you post your model definitions and some test code that triggers the error 
what does the sql look like 
can you show a test case where it fails  even better  provide a pull request with a failing unit test   
can you show the association you would like to add 
can you try logging  user associations   might be a naming issue  as in 'entity' might not be renamed properly to 'entities' 
could you create a simple test case 
can you show your model definition  and the generated query 
do you mean that routinetasks is only used as a  through  table in an n m relation  that query looks like it comes from a  task hasmany routinetask   relation
what does your model  relations and bulkcreate call look like currently 
what exception  model build returns an instance so you should check for model build instanceof model instance
which version are you on  a fix for something like this was deployed recently so you might want to try upgrading to latest master
what's the expected sql for a varchar array with length 
which sequelize version are you using  and does the output from  sync  show the correct constraints 
do you know how many calls are done before this happens  perhaps it's reproduceable by running a ton of the same calls 
can you post a minimable reproducible test case with models etc 
did you solve the issue  santiagoaguiar 
could you please specify an example of your  aftercreate  hook  i think you could missed a  return  of a  promise  or called  callback  without breaking function flow 
what version are you using and what does the sql look like 
what is  product stock  before the update  if you are working off the latest version  update  will ignore attributes that haven't been changed 
which version are you on  if sounds like the error might have been swallowed in a promise chain
which version are you using and which dialect 
which columns are being violated by the unique constraint error  can you show a self contained example to reproduce the problem 
which sequelize version 
what is the actually installed version   not necessarily the one listed in package json when using caret   github uses github flavored markdown which has support for marking up code 
which hook are you talking about  please show some actual code  also  please add a more descriptive title
can you try removing that  and see if the issue persists 
can you post the bluebird version used by the two versions of sequelize  eitherway i don't think you should rely on unhandled rejections 
which version are you on  do the queries look correct
what version of sequelize  i believe we've covered most of these issues by now  would be helpfull to see your model definitions and relation setups 
what version of  2 0 x  specifically  i think we've had and fixed this bug previously  i could be wrong though 
why not just use a regular unique constraint  if you absolutely want a custom check you should use a beforecreate hook
does it work if you use   define 'name'  attributes   schema  'users'    
does it work if you do eg  employee participation     role  'something'       will this insert something into the join table  or is it ignored completely 
what version is your postgres database 
can you post a small reproduceable set of models association and calls that show this bug 
can you show the stack for the error 
when you have a field thats a uuid  why not mark it as the primarykey of that table 
does   work 
can you try  req user instanceof user instance   passport might be mucking about with something 
can you show the models and assoications 
however  i guess the syntax is more terse for older versions 
do you have a type defined for the field  in that case it should use that https   github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib model js#l1508  otherwise it should default to float
can you please provide some more detail  yes  sequelize defaults to saving everything in utc  but that can be changed 
can you try logging  parents 0  children 0  datavalues  
what do you mean  separate transactions should run in sequence  or the operations in a transaction should run in sequence 
does not currently exist  not trivial to implement  how do we know if its a new or existing update  especially relevant for non ai pks 
can you give it a go 
does that work with default value or is it an extra field attribute 
can you post the sql called and the full error message 
what is  application   absolutely sure it is defined and is a sequelize model 
when do they do that exactly 
what is happening 
what's the error  what's the sql 
can't you run npm install  i am not aware that sequelize does symlinks  where exactly do you find a symlink 
how should this work if you don't provide separate aliases for the includes 
can you link to the documentation where it says that  seems there is some confusion between versions  that syntax is for 4 0  for 3 x you should use  user instance prototype instancelevelmethod 
can you wrap your code into a  sequelize sscce  https   github com papb sequelize sscce  please 
what exactly did you try 
doesn't  sequelize close    work for you 
could you check if  console log  isn't overrided in your code somewhere 
doesn't look like the underlying supports 'options'  any of the official maintainers have an objection to adding a parameter so 'before' and 'after' are possible  https   github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib dialects mysql query generator js#l102
what version of sequelize are you using 
would overriding  set  on the attribute do the trick for you 
can you provide a full stack 
what is exactly what you want  i thought that you were trying to define an attribute as  nvarchar  supplying a max length to it 
what do you mean "synchronize between banks"  seems like your question has more to do with the programming rather than sequelize itself 
can you show me the code 
why would you order something that is just one result  thanks  i will reopen if necessary 
what is the value of  expenses   
does removing them altogether makes the scope stop working 
can you create a pr with a test case and your suggested  clone  change 
how is it possible to have two tables with the same name 
can you  or someone else  please provide a  sscce  http   sscce org    also known as  mcve reprex  https   stackoverflow com help minimal reproducible example    this will help tackling the issue faster 
does  generatetransactionid    have any side effect  in the current code it can be called twice apparently   
did i miss something  also  does the  ondelete  'cascade'  is your code mean something or is it just leftover code 
did it help or was it a hassle 
did you find any resolution 
what do you mean here 
what do you think 
did you finded a solution 
can this issue be closed  thanks
what compiler  both those identifiers are in the included files methods h and getset h 
what does aborted mean  edit  could you instrument the test so that we have a better idea of where it aborts 
do someone
how about decorating it with suitable gcc unused attributes 
can you give some information about your system  this error doesn't normally show up 
can you give it a try 
can you be more specific on what the exact problem is and what you propose as a solution 
does this cause a problem with 32 bit integers also  how much memory do you have 
can you do a clean install 
should be fixed now  can you please try with current head 
do you have a concrete example where this functionality is needed

what compiler optimization are you using 
did this happen in 1 13  it's possible i introduced this in #10042  or in the commit described here  https   github com numpy numpy pull 10042#issuecomment 345466607
would setting the  module  attribute correctly be enough 
can you try numpy installed from a wheel

what does  file  opt freeware lib64 python3 7 site packages numpy 1 16 0 py3 7 aix 6 1 egg numpy core _multiarray_umath so  say  that  so  name looks wrong  what does your python report for  python  c"import imp  print imp get_suffixes   "   where did you get this numpy from 
when you run  python  c"import numpy"  exactly in the same environment and directory that you run the compiled code  does it succeed 
did you read all of the information carefully  because the paths it prints do  not  look like anaconda paths 
how about  xhr instead 
can we send you a t shirt for this and other bug reports  email me your size  shirt preference  address and phone number  https   plus google com 104744871076396904202 posts vuf67m5eq2v
can you provide a better example for this which works cross browsers  in the mean time i am closing this issue 
could you include a jsfiddle which reproduces the issue 
what kind of attitude is that  see it like this  you had 2 years to provide a pr 
what do you mean  http interceptors run whenever you make a request or receive a response  via  http
can you be more concrete  are you referring to supporting translation strings or something else 
what are you not seeing 
can you repro this 
could you pull together a fiddle or plunk for this 
maybe i'm looking at it wrong  also  could you see if your issue still exists in angular 1 2 19 
can you provide some more concrete example of this problem  perhaps a link to some code 
would it be possible for you to update the plunker so it shows the specific issue that rc4 broke 
will this cause confusion 
maybe http   plnkr co  works better  or can you stick your demo in a gist that we can download and see failing 
could you put together a small app that demonstrates the bug 
could you cut down your plunker to the absolute minimal  meaningful part and post your question on the mailing list  angular googlegroups com  or stackoverflow 
do you have a reproducible case 
how exactly does that cause you problems  is it that you don't want the parameter on your template requests 
could you collaborate more on what you were doing so that we can better evaluate the issue 
could you provide a live reproduce scenario 
can't you use a different attribute name  e  i see  you already changed the attribute name 
could you create a plunkr which demonstrates that bug  having something concrete would help us debug 
can you provide a running example of your problem 
why don't we simply do  erroraddingdeclarationlocationstack prototype   error prototype    or new error      wouldn't that work  
can you provide a runnable example of this to make it easier to debug 
can you provide a link to the 2 x suite of tests and perhaps the result of running  q against it 
what version are you using 
would it be possible to have a plunker that shows how you run into this issue with a normal app 
can you please provide a minimal reproduction of your issue  i tried to reproduce it  but am unable to  http   plnkr co edit gp4gmtx5hcftmyhqw9kl p preview
do we need to special case length 0 case 
can you confirm that this is a ie specific behaviour  does it work in firefox  ie10 
what do you think  tbosch  is that worthwhile  string format dates could still be supported via  min "'03 17 1988'"  or something
can you have a test with this patch  here are the files  https   s3 amazonaws com angularjs dev ng animate ie 10 angular js https   s3 amazonaws com angularjs dev ng animate ie 10 angular animate js
what is db messages    it might be that the callbacks are not executed inside an angular app context  so you need to call  scope  apply    
can you share the scenario in which you need this 
why do you need to escape them  html allows brackets in quoted strings   1
can we close this issue 
why do you need to use   q when      and why do you need a   timeout   
could that be why it wasn’t done like that  i definitely prefer your last suggestion  whereby we’d allow the consumer to override the whitelist completely to add or remove items 
can you check the actual headers  either in the web inspector   network panel or log them on the server  and compare the diff between 1 2 8 and 1 2 9 
can you write a plnkr showing a case where "finally" isn't defined 
could you post a reproduction  i'm not seeing where httpbackend would be setting readonly properties from the headers object   
how are you loading it   is the error thrown on ie9 only   have you tried on other ies   how about ie11 in ie9 mode  
could you post a quick reproduction of this issue to a plnkr 
would you like to have a stab at it  
can you not make your asset pipeline put directly into   templatecache   if not  your solution with the delegate is the correct one imo 
can you fix the plunker please  it doesn't work at all  so it's not helpful for debugging 
could you please provide an example through plunker lest i misunderstand your question 
why are you using ngmock in e2e tests 
what in particularly are you working on that you need to do this  maybe there's a better way to take care of it 
what exactly do you want to achieve with that 
why not just use  ng if  instead of  when   maybe there could be a flag on the   form   element that does this 
can you please post a  minimal  reproduction  thanks  also  you don't need to resolve your deferred during  apply  resolve will trigger  apply anyways 
can you provide a plunkr for this 
what is wrong with the directive definition object 
what browser are you seeing this in  i can't seem to reproduce in chrome
maybe it should set it also if there's no value 
do you have a plunkr link  also  what version are you using of angular  there was a fix recently which prevents it from hiding whlist inside of an animation 
would you mind sending us a pr with the https   docs angularjs org guide expression update 
why not just use ngmocks'   httpbackend  to test this with proper  http 
why do you care about the option values 
what is  vm   where does it come from  my first intuition is that this shouldn't even work  because there is no controller defined 
what's the exact scenario where this happens  can you try to isolate the problem and put it in a plnkr or similar 
can you provide some example code from your template or a demo 
could you create a jsfiddle   plunker for your particular use case

how do other libraries handle this 
does this happen with the latest 1 2 x release 
can you make sure all you included angular files have the same version

why can't you just inject the   injector   which is so meta and cool  stuck_out_tongue     
did you try with jquery 
which api call you would expect to fail "immediately" 
would it be possible for you to create a plunker that shows this issue 
could you please share a reproduce scenario using plunker  jsfiddle or similar 
could you please confirm 
what exactly do you want to do  i don't see any  http in your example  i only see  interval 
what do you mean by "not working"  i can see _some_ results displayed and no error on the console  what is the expected vs  buggy behavior 
can you show an example where this causes an error 
can you please put the example in a plnkr or similar  it's easier to see what's going on 
do you have an example of this in action 
can you provide code   a demo of this happening 
can you please provide a demo of the code that reproduces this issue 
what if i already have the nglocale module  
do you define css animations on  ngview   
where are you trying to run this code   what version of the angular framework are you using 
can you elaborate on "crash"  if the browser crashes  that's a firefox bug you should report on bugzilla mozilla org  if you just mean it throws  that seems expected
can you please provide a plnkr or similar for these issues  especially the first  the second one sounds like a known nganimate bug 
can you show us what you're doing with transformdata  thanks 
do you mean you cannot download angular from angularjs org or that you cannot use it with a browser in windows 10

maybe there's something wrong with the formatting 
why not using localstorage  i'd bet you would get rid of all of these issues 
can you please post a demo in a plnkr co or similar 
doesn't that mean jsdom doesn't provide the node global 
can you please create a plnkr that repdroduces the error you mentioned 
can you please describe what should happen  and what happens instead  the screenshots don't really explain it 
why don't you use  ng readonly  and make the input readonly if the email is valid 
can you be more exact with the versions of ios for which this doesn't work 
does only you angular app not work  or all angular apps  and what's the exact name of the plugin 
what version of angular are you using  also  a demo app would be good although that might be difficult in that case 
what is net_error  does the browser show these errors in the network request  as for the codes   3 and  101 where do they come from

can you share a minimal reproduction 
can you detail the steps to reproduce the issue   1   https   code angularjs org 1 6 1 docs guide animations#animations on app bootstrap page load
did you update all your  angular js  libraries to  1 6 3    looks like a duplicate of #15788  #15789  #15791  #15814

does that answer your question 
do you have any anti virus software that would prevent it from installing

does this happen with all vagrant boxes using winrm  or just that one specifically   eriksonbahr
do you get a different result if you run vagrant without it  thanks 
does it work with   stacktraces off 
did it work before 
should export allow an 'as' after it's main identifier  like import does 
does that do what you are looking for 
maybe because there are no member functions 
maybe it's not complete or had i accidentally fixed it 
could you reduce the problem a bit 
can they be read at compile time when not using the js backend 
can you try it with the latest compiler from the devel branch please 
can this be closed 
what's wrong with the error message  'find' uses '  '  that's obvious enough but there is also an "instantiation from here" message 
maybe a better error message would be enough 
wouldn't this be made redundant with type classes 
would it work to just rebuild the csources for the devel branch 
how did you fix it 
why don't you just quote it 
maybe you do dangerous stuff with 'cast'  does your program use multi threading 
does it really dont have support of  signalfd   or maybe it just hidden 
does   cstring   "string"  work 
what advantages would that bring 
can you fence your code with backticks 
could your replace the image with text so it's easier to search 
how do you plan on typing these unicode characters in 
what does    reportconceptfailures on  produce 
could be due to this https   github com nim lang nim commit fb4ff86ad666bbb21ccc07d7bd5fd4a3cdd09d56    cheatfate any ideas 
what version do you use 
does it take 3809 seconds or something 
couldn't a conversion be used instead of trunc 
what about irc    
what is your use case 
does 0 12 0 work with this 
can you give an example 
what is the output of  nim  v   specifically  git hash  value 
why  was that json even produced with the marshal module 
can you show us more of your code  as a workaround you can use   server socket accept result       
why  shouldn't the callback "compose" the stuff 
why not  a single underscore can be an identifier 
why do you want to interact with the data connection directly 
does such approach works for you 
what does this mean  update the package for nim 
does changing  bar none  into  none bar   help 
could you please show a running example exposing this error 
where is the bug in that 
does it work with nim 0 18  look like a similar issue to regression https   github com nim lang nim issues 9441
what c compiler used  os  cpu arch  calling convention 
does it happen without the    newruntime  switch 
does this result in unexpected behavior if the linked files are no longer available 
what does   nre   do 
should the "expected output" be a better error  because  let  variables are assigned values at runtime and not at compile time 
what would this be useful for 
could you please retest 
what is your error  are you sure that the scikit is actually built inplace 
can you give more details  what did you do and what was the error message  have you tried setting  dyld_fallback_library_path   http   stackoverflow com questions 3146274 is it ok to use dyld library path on mac os x and whats the dynamic library s
does that seem reasonnable  could you try that on your problem and send us a pull request if it works 
should we raise a warning  or even an error  i guess that we could add a check to our existing check functions 
would you like to submit a pull request 
could you detail a bit more  please 
would you like to submit a pull request  that would be awesome   
do you know if this method actually makes sense for this setup  i'll have too look up in the paper    in the meantime i wrote up #662 
could you send us a pull request with a non regression test  
could you post a minimal example  preferably with data  to reproduce the behavior  thanks  andy
can you be more explicit 
what would be the benefit of having several functions 
maybe it is a scipy matrix  could you give us  type x   
maybe they can have a look   or maybe  jaquesgrobler 
why don't you use an  image map  http   en wikipedia org wiki image_map   i'm pretty sure there are gui's for that 
could you say which version you are on  i can't reproduce this in the current git version 
what is  none  supposed to mean 
can you give us maybe your numpy and scipy versions  thanks 
what's the failure 
which version of the html documentation are you refering to   http   scikit learn org stable     which version of sklearn are you using 
could you please provide a minimalistic example data array that triggers the issue to turn it into a non regression test 
can you check or provide the line number 
can you tell us the output from    
which version are you using 
do you mean keep only  max_features   per document  rather than  max_features  for all documents 
which os  hardware platform 
could you please open a pull request for this 
can you please submit a pr with a non regression test and the fix 
would you like to submit a pr to fix this  
can you write properly the problem you want to solve 
which version is this  can you reproduce the error with the latest scikit learn from github  the parallel processing backend of random forests has been overhauled 
how else would you define  predict_proba  
can you check that it works correctly now 
can we have the full error message  please 
maybe labelsufflesplit 
can you check that this bug has been fixed in  scikit learn  0 15 0b1  
could this https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 3128 be a fix for your use case 
can you please run 
when you say "only" which versions are you excluding  is there anyway to do a git bisect or do you think it's a packaging issue
how can you use lda without targets y  
what do you think 
did you use  labelencoder  on unicode data  i guess we considered this such an edge case that we didn't want to bump the dependencies for it 
what version are you using   how did you install  i suspect an install bug 
do you have a reference of nb using the unbiased estimate  i think we should rather use the standard algorithm 
should we somehow identify this case  then  and provide a better error message  or is too specialised 
maybe that  alpha 1  is the same as adding one example that is all zero and one that is all ones to each class  that is true  right   
what do you mean  could you give us a reference 
what code includes  from sklearn cross_validation import train_test_split  labelkfold  
why can you not just use a labelbinarizer  unless i'm missing something  not allowing 1 d inputs was explicitly done here  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 5152 
maybe the documentation can be extended to mention the double randomization 
which version of scikit learn is that 
can you explain your use case  can you not simple call binarizer and then map the values as you wanted them  like
do you have a ref for this  i am not sure i understand the usecase or the actual regression model 
do you want to do it 
can you please give the full code to reproduce  and the full traceback  which version of scikit learn are you using 
does that answer your questions 
which version of scikit learn are you using 
would you have a small script to reproduce your error   rfe  should already take  feature_importances_  into account  see https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob master sklearn feature_selection rfe py#l180
which version of scikit learn are you using  i thought we fixed that in 0 16  or 0 15  
how would you fix this  what test would you use to check that we do it the right way 
can i take this issue 
could you provide a _minimal_ code snippet able to reproduce to problem 
should i close this issue  or transform it to a documentation problem 
can you check if some of your inputs are constant vectors  i am fixing a very similar issue on  correlation   https   github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 4475  in pr https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 5333
do you want to do a pr 
can you point me to it with a link so i can see what issue you're thinking about 
could you provide your dataset 
does  metrics v_measure_score  solve the problem 
can you give us the data maybe 
can you post the full traceback   also it would be great if you could put together a stand alone example that reproduces the problem 
can you please test if that still has the same issue  ping  tguillemot
could you share the  s_data  
can you specify your environment and which file contains  from sklearn utils validation import check_arrays  
would  clone  http   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn base clone html  method be able to serve the purpose here  
can you provide the full traceback 
could you please pull the latest changes from master and try running the test suite again   cheers 
can you do a pull request 
what's the issue with   get_support      http   scikit learn org dev modules generated sklearn feature_selection selectfrommodel html#sklearn feature_selection selectfrommodel get_support
would you be interested to put together a pr for this   thanks 
what scikit learn version are you on  running the code snippet at the bottom of the issue template and pasting it here is an easy way to get that information 
what's the type of  x_test_tfidf   shouldn't it be a sparse matrix  sparse matrices don't have an   array    method  do they 
what's your browser and os 
do you mean that we should provide  shuffle  with a  copy false  option 
what is the congrete benefit compared to a callable  we frown on adding classes  they make the package harder to understand 
can you provide code to reproduce 
would you be able to confirm that this fixes your case  would you like to submit a pull request 
do you think that you can dig up that discussion 
do you want to submit a pull request to fix it  alternatively  you could also move the plotting function into a new module   sklearn plot   if you feel like it 
can you say what you'd expect to happen 
what other use cases are there apart from   sample_weights   
maybe  jorisvandenbossche has time to investigate  setting   n_values 'auto'   does result in the correct behavior  i guess it's too late to put this into 0 20 2    
doesn't that qualify as missing data  or is this aimed at the cases with few missing values where sparse array representation is not optimal 
can you provide a stand alone snippet to reproduce the problem   please read https   stackoverflow com help mcve 
would the proposed fix make the following example script return consistent results https   github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 8943#issuecomment 307930597

what is the shape of your data 
maybe you could add a bit more details where you got your expected result from 
do you want to send a pr to improve the documentation  i think the    1   was a recent addition and the docs were not updated 
what do you do to trigger this warning 
do you want to propose a pull request 
can i take this  
can you try on master please  i feel like we changed something there but i'm not sure

can you provide me some example code that demonstrates what you're trying to do 
maybe virtuals 
what is your use case 
could you post something i can run  this will aid me in understanding this ticket 
can you provide some standalone code that reproduces this  mongoose has a somewhat brittle way of handling the case where you update an array and remove elements in an array 
do you have backups 
maybe it should be that if you give an array you get an array  and if you give a spread  you get a spread 
would that work for your use case 
can you confirm which version of mongoose 
do you have a package json in the directory you're trying to install from 
however  if you're just dependent on the structure of the object  how about calling   toobject     like  var field   m toobject   field  
can you provide some code that duplicates this

what is  options connection   i added a test case above and it looks like the result of  createconnection    is definitely an instance of  mongoose connection    
can you clarify  i don't quite understand your issue 
do you need to create a mongoose connection asynchronously  might save yourself some headache if you just create a connection once and reuse it 
can you see if fixing that fixes your issue  and  if not  see if you can modify my script to reproduce your issue  thanks  beers   palm_tree 
maybe just a check if "countdocuments" has a query parameter  if not  warn about it that estimateddocumentcount is probabaly the right way to go

can you pley provide more substantial code samples  i don't understand your issue 
why not just   or something like  mongoose autopopulate  https   www npmjs com package mongoose autopopulate  
could you use discriminators to inherit from a base schema that has the hook you're looking for  or does that not solve your use case 
can you do  mongoose set 'debug'  true   and paste the mongo output 
what home page are you talking about 
does that sound reasonable 
can you please provide more substantial code samples 
why not upgrading to the latest version of mongoose 
do you want to store an array or a hash object  
can you elaborate on why you want to define the hook on the nested schema instead of the top level one  also    findbyidandupdate    triggers the  findoneandupdate  middleware  
what alternative would you suggest

can you try a trivial example like mine  just to see if it behaves as expected 
does this solution work for you 
do you know if the cpu usage comes from your program or from the mongodb server 
can you provide a code sample that shows your schema  model creation  doc insertion  and relevant queries  this will make it easier to identify the issue  thanks

can you please file this on https   github com jekyll jekyll sass converter   thank you 
where are you running the  bundle exec jekyll server   watch  command 
did you remove the gem and are having the issue  are you polling  we need more information for this to be diagnostically feasible 
can you please explain  why this doesn't make sense in your opinion 
why do you have tags with different cases  they should be unique based on lowercase character content 
did you run  jekyll help   you'll find that you need to add a subcommand  try  jekyll build  w  or  jekyll serve  w  
why do you mark it as read only  we need to be able to rewrite on each build   smile 
can you please provide me with a stack trace 
can you please post this same issue on https   github com jekyll classifier reborn issues 
can you post the error message  that'll help us better debug the issue 
what markdown processor are you using  is your site on github  can you post a link 
does it just need to be  require 'd  if so  just add it to  gems  in your  _config yml   beyond this  there's no functionality  what would you want these for 
what's the benefit of id's over classes in your opinion 
what markdown parser are you using  the default for the current version is kramdown 
which one is deleted  our  cleaner  class cleans up the site destination to prevent files that aren't in the resulting site from lying around 
did you remove  _site  before each run  we use the  same  excluded   method  https   github com jekyll jekyll blob master lib jekyll entry_filter rb#l48 l52   we aim to be much like  git 's   gitignore  
when you tried that  did it work  we use  file fnmatch   under the hood so anything that works there will likely work with jekyll
what does it give you if you run jekyll with    trace  
what did you edit recently  the property it's trying to affect is   page data   https   github com jekyll jekyll blob v2 5 1 lib jekyll page rb#l35 l37   which should be a  hash   not a  string  
can you please post the actual output you got too 
what are the contents of the base folder  what is the rubygems version 
can you use the latest  master  and try again 
maybe this can be merged into #3747 
how would you word it  please send a pr 
does assign accept other variables  if it doesn't then this is an upstream issue 
can you  strace  when that happens and give us a small context 
does this affect only posts for you  or for all documents pages posts 
does it work with all that disabled 
do you have any non english characters in  assets css styles scss  or any of its imports 
what is  page excerpted  
can you provide an example  or the source of a site  that builds correctly with 3 0 and incorrectly with 3 1 
when you add them to your  _config yml   you don't see  _data myfile json  and  _data myfile2 json  in your resulting site under  _site _data myfile json  and  _site _data myfile2 json  
did you try  encoding  utf8   no hyphen  
would you please submit a patch to clear this value for each render 
could you provide further clarification if you feel at least 80  of users would use this feature 
what happens if you run  jekyll serve   source blog   destination etc everywhere   baseurl  blog  and change the file  is it re generated 
what is the use case for this 
what plugins are you using  unfortunately  i believe this is a known issue of a couple of our plugins  not related to jekyll core 
what plugins are you using 
when was the depreciation message added  if during 3 x  maybe we could remove it when 4 0 lands  if 2 x  maybe we don't even need to wait that long 
how can i reproduce this on my machine 
can you provide any detail regarding _why_ you need this 
could you provide more information about the version of jekyll you’re using  etc    basically the information from the issue template  so that somebody can try to debug this 
can you escape the accented characters in the pathname  seems like something else is awry here with how this is handled 🤔 
could you provide a public repository where we can reproduce this 
could you  repeat the exact the same thing  and push the changed file to   a new branch   on your repository   
what command are you running  i know that  jekyll serve  works fine in  forestry's instant previews  https   forestry io docs previews instant previews    running a ruby 2 6 docker image  
could you please provide a reproducible example 
would a link to the  aes_linetype_size_shape   http   docs ggplot2 org current aes_linetype_size_shape html  documentation be sufficient  or is more detail needed than what is presented there 
would you mind including the plot images as well  the  reprex  https   github com tidyverse reprex  package can help streamline this 
what version of ggplot2 are you using  i can't reproduce this error with 3 1 0 
would you be interested in doing a pr 
could you explain a specific use case provide a mock up 
maybe you need to re install in a clean r session 
did pointrange use to display just the points if ymin ymax were missing 
do you mind asking it over there   you might want to read  https   www tidyverse org help   first to maximise your chances of getting a good answer 
what version of shiny are you using  you need the latest  0 13 0 
can't you use  widthdetails    etc 
what's the problem here 
can you share how the ggplot2 object came into being 
can you please create your reprex with the reprex package 
wouldn't it make more sense to just always normalize the weights before applying them 
could you please provide a minimal reproducible example using the  reprex  https   github com tidyverse reprex  package  i'm having trouble reproducing the example from that so link 
how about   for one  the desirable width will depend on the x scale  it is less wierd though 
would there be something similar to that for the  panel  aesthetic  what would  scale_panel_   functions do 
can you please file an issue on the svglite repo instead  if you have time  a reprex that only uses  plot    instead of ggplot2  would be much appreciated 
do you mind asking it over there   you might want to read https   www tidyverse org help  first to maximise your chances of getting a good answer  
do you mean something like  this  https   stackoverflow com questions 14817006 ggplot version of charts performancesummary  
what do you envision the legend should show in this example  the only two aesthetic mappings in your plot are position aesthetics  and they have guides along the axes 
could you check this against the 3 3 0 release candidate and see if the problem is still present  https   github com tidyverse ggplot2 tree v3 3 0 rc
do you mind uploading the file somewhere and share me the file so i can test it 
when you access the attachment  you always get a paperclip  attachment object  so  present  always evaluates to true    to test if the attachment has a file attached  use attachment_name file 
could you send me a stack trace from the timeout error  as well as your attachment's configuration 
what's going on under the hood  my guess is that your processor is trying to crop images and such  but imagemagick bails out   this post  http   awesomeful net posts 33 attach non image files in rails with paperclip  might help

why are you using 1 9 1  1 9 2 is pretty much superior in every way  imo  try using 1 9 2 and if that doesn't work i'd switch to minimagick or ruby 1 8 7 
would changing the behavior break this  and cause something like this to always return true
maybe that's part  or all  of the problem

did you happen to use any specific  configure  flags 
do you get the same configuration error  to run autogen  you may need to install packages like libtool  automake  and autoconf 
should zfs dkms depend on them  or is it a dependancy bug higher up the dependency chain  btw  i rebooted both of the real servers yesterday  they came up fine 
could you post your kernel version and the failure you're seeing 
when you subsequently run say  make  s  are there any build problems or does it compile cleanly 
maybe a stupid question  but did you run  code   autogen sh  code  and reran  code   configure  code  
which distribution is this  is this a fresh checkout  the build system should have handled this  would you post the config log from zfs 
can you try reverting 2b2861362f7dd09cc3167df8fddb6e2cb475018a and see how it goes  also  it would be interesting to test with my  msync c  program described in #907 
what does  zgrep config_preempt  proc config gz  say 
what version was it running successfully on in the past  e6b760dd7 doesn't appear to describe a commit in the zol tree  can you share what whose branch you're on 
did the ext4 filesystem fill up  did the zpool itself fill up resulting in the error 
does calling drop_caches release the memory   echo 3   proc sys vm drop_caches 
where are your rootfs and swap stored  are they on zfs or external to zfs 
can you reference an open issue 
do you have that one disabled  also  can you show more of the build log that you're getting 
why not clone  equiv to git branch  instead of rollback to preserve intermediate snapshots 
may i suggest setting the module parameter   zfs_autoimport_disable  instead  then you can import on your own time using the cache file for acceleration 
would you tell us more about what you were doing when you triggered this problem 
which version of zol are you using  which distribution do you run and what are the distribution and kernel versions 
maybe reattach the original disk and try _zpool clear_ or _zpool online_  
do you have an " etc hostid"  does regenerating your initrd  "sudo mkinitramfs  k all  u"  after manually importing the zpool fix this 
which kernel version 
which version of zfs on linux do you use 
what does  zpool import  say 
what version of zfs are you using 
what's your pool configuration  i e   zpool list  v  what's  zpool get freeing  show 
what distro and kernel are you running  something's changed if that symbol isn't available without gpl
did you get a chance to look in to any of the failures  i suspect they're largely trivial issues with the script 
maybe there's something else in the console log 
do you happen to have test case we can use to reproduce this 
why  i think it's not zfs problem   
did you manually trigger the resilver  my  educated  guess  this was caused by some time synchronization functionality between your xen hypervisor and the vm 
why are there multiple receive processes to the same dataset 
what kernel was used before   what zfs spl version was used before   what did change from "by older version"  
can you confirm that it's ok now 
do you have acl's enabled on the dataset  from man zfs 8  
did you test on same kernel version  looks like https   github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 8793
what kind of hardware are you running the pool on 
which version is in use on the system generating the zfs send stream  potentially you are affected by the issue fixed in https   github com zfsonlinux zfs pull 6616
did you compile zfs by yourself  proxmox distributes 0 7 4 with https   github com zfsonlinux zfs commit 0873bb6337452e3e028e40f5dad945b30deab185 cherry pick http   download proxmox com debian pve dists stretch pvetest binary amd64 zfsutils linux_0 7 4 pve2 bpo9 changelog  
what features are enabled on the pool  i had the same problem in #6931 but got it fixed with 454365b 
maybe we can get another person on the packaging team to help keep it up to date 
can you provide your settings   zfs get all  pool  volume 
can you give us more information about your setup  you seem to have removed the issue template  thanks edit  possibly related to #8175
what's your pool configuration and what was the arrangement of snapshots that you destroyed  and what was the destroy command  thanks 
can you add the ereport 
what is the sector size  ashift   what is the vdev configuration   zpool list  v   
what does the syslog say about the failed service zfs mount  does  modprobe  v zfs  load the modules 
when you talk about "pool hanging"  isn't just the pool saturated with io  if so  could it be that deleting snapshots  for some reason  floods it with high priority io 
can you try this   
what is the issue  can you provide a screenshot with the problem 
can you please provide an example of this problem  i don't have any issues with adding events in the past in my calendar 
could you provide mockup up screenshots  hard to visualize
could you please post detailed information on your device os browser like i did  any other preconditions to recreating the bug that we should know about  closing until a response is given

might you have added an exclusion rule accidentally  you can check  and remove  your exclusion rules on the options page 
what are your link hint settings  alphabet hints  yes  perhaps a screenshot  is this opera yandex only  or chrome too 
would there be a natural way to do this with visual mode 
do global marks  with capital letters  not meet your needs   harshayburadkar  separately  the observation that the number keys have no meaning in marks mode is interesting 
do you press  ctrl  to enter      vimium treats  ctrl    as  escape  
could you be more specific about what doesn't work  you can map your own keys on the options page  see examples  here  https   github com philc vimium wiki key mappings  
do you mean vimium does not scroll for a page shorter than the screen  or vimium stops working wholly 
maybe #2239 
do you have the _don't let pages steal the focus on load_ selected  that could be at play too  does  gi  work 
can you use  enterinsertmode   normally mapped to  i   to make vimium yeild to these other extensions  this works for most similar situations 
does that work for you 
could you try creating a new profile  installing vimium there and seeing whether you still have the problem 
what makes you think that this is a vimium issue   i'm just trying to figure out what might be the problem  
what about the content script  so  the regular js console  
do you have an example site for this issue 
what do you mean by "tagging"  do you mean the characters used for link hints 
what about blacklisting   c     and not just      i'm not sure whether that works  but that's how to notate such a binding in vim 
do you know if i can assign the arrow key as an access key  otherwise i could use    period  and    comma 
what are you seeing now 
maybe adding this would also solve #339 
do you have an example i can debug with 
what do you think 
how about updating it with the latest instructions for those who still want to use the php version  the instructions appear out of date 
do you think that's acceptable 
can you test in an incognito window please 
what's your username so i can test this 
which browser are you seeing this in  obviously we'd still like to fix it   
could you be a bit more specific  i don't quite understand what the problem is  thanks 
do you have the version of jsbin you're running 
do you mean for resize the panels  http   d pr i yjnb
how about stripping out all comments and then parsing  that could make it eaiser to _not_ use esprima  the footprint is rather large
would you be able to show us a screen shot of the network requests from the developer tools to help us debug and fix this issue 
will land tomorrow + allouis   can you push to live 
can you post a screenshot  full screen  of what you're seeing 
can you give us some info about the system on which you're trying to install it  os  npm version etc   
what about foreign languages with their own  enormous   black lists for rude words 
do you have a bin that i look at 
could be that the processor hasn't loaded  or run  until the panel is rendered 
can you include a screenshot of the error you're seeing 
can you try clearing your cookies or an incognito window 
can you try to sign in from a private session  like a new incognito window in chrome   just ruling some things out 
does clearing the "detect when file is changed outside the environment" checkbox in visual studio's options under environment   documents not do what you want 
could you please re open this issue 
can you send me a pointer to the viemu feature 
can you be more specific here on which command this is failing for 
which behavior are you expecting 
can you give me a quick code sample that this is reproing for you  i've tried this a few times on some code an the behavior appears to be correct
which plugin do you have installed 
did you mean named register instead of named buffer 
do you have anything other plugin's on the machine  second exception looks to just be my fault  should be a straight forward fix 
which version of vsvim are you using  this was a bug in 0 9 6 but it should be fixed in 1 0 
can you give me some more information on what's not working  i'm unfamiliar with that particular feature  it will help to understand the expected behavior of this feature 
can you tell me a bit more about your setup    do you have any other extensions installed    are you using a non english os or vs installation 
could you post a copy of your  vimrc file 
can you run   set  and paste the output 
what in particular is causing problems here  is there a part of the vim experience i'm getting wrong that needs to be fixed 
what all extensions do you have installed on this machine 
what keyboard layout are you using 
can you check and see if you have  virtualedit  set to the same value in both cases 
do you have an example where it's not working  that feature is implemented  just ran a couple of sanity checks locally on   c   
would you mind posting your  _vimrc  file somewhere that i could take a look at it 
can you tell me what other extensions you have installed on that machine  occasionally other extensions can break this support by intercepting some events we depend on 
could you outline the particular scenario that is important to you though so i make sure i have the right fix going in 
can you think of anything else besides  tab  and  shift+tab  that would improve the native feel of select mode 
could you post your _vimrc somewhere 
should we go to reset user data 
can you run the command  vsvim dumpkeyboard  from the command window inside visual studio and paste the results here  the output will be stored in   localappdata vsvim keyboard txt 
can you post the contents of your vimrc file  it's possible vsvim is picking up a setting from that file it's misinterpreting which is causing this behavior 
can you provide more information about this please 
what versions of vs and vsvim do you guys have installed 
which version of r# do you have installed 
what do you think we should do 
can you try repairing it and seeing if the installation can proceed afterwards 
how is  kbd ctrl m  kbd  intended to work here 
can you run   set  and see if the  kbd j  kbd  command is incorrectly mapped 
does that solve your problem    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 30384885 50344175 31931980 052a 11e9 8560 087bc314fc56 png  i tried this to get to run with "your" keys  but that resulted in the same problem     vnoremap j  vsc edit moveselectedlinesdown cr  
do you happen to know if that works in windows  i'll look into it 
do you have   set clipboard unnamed  in effect  if so  can you check whether yank exhibits the same symptoms  if it does  then the problem might be the clipboard 
can we close this issue

where did you download jstree from  i downloaded my copy from jstree com  pre 1 0 fixed  and don't need to include vakata js   
can you give me some sample json 
maybe you are intercepting the mouse up event and the dragging never stops

which version are you using 
could you please provide steps to reproduce 
could you please provide a demo and steps to reproduce so that i can debug 
maybe this is something your browser does  when dealing with focused elements  anyway   you can try to remove it using css 
does it work  if it does   then the custom contextmenu items function is the problem  if it does not   please let me know and i will reopen 
which browser are you using  do you see any errors in the console 
do you use the  custom element

can you attach a crash report that is generated when you restart goldencheetah 
what file  what device  does it import anwhere else  can your provide a file  can you provide more precise detail about the error 
what 'tweaks' have you coded up  maybe we should add them to gc 
can you try now   we just implemented a different algorithm thats much faster

can you send me the two files  would be good to try and recreate  liversedge gmail com
can you add a written description of the workout to help me to interpret the file  thanks 
does it do it with a particular ride  perhaps the same one that causes merge to crash 
why not to use combined queries for that purpose 
do you know if it uses github issues or do we need to replicate them 
which version are you using  do you have smart recording enabled in gc  see https   github com goldencheetah goldencheetah issues 2605
can you attach the file for debugging 
could you give us your goldencheetah version  
could you also reproduce this in a non enum type 
would you
can you also find the stacktrace that's printed to the error stderr 
maybe throwables   or exceptions   i don't like any of those  if no good ideas forthcoming by 2018 12 01  close issue 
how would you then convert  something2name  
can you give more information  like a stacktrace or a minimal code that reproduces the problem  otherwise  there would be not enough information for someone help you 
what would be the added value to final getters setters over public members  
can you please try to use an  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge  to check if the problem still exists

can you please provide the minimal program to demonstrate the error 
can you give us the smallest java program that demonstrates this behavior  what ide you are using  and the version of lombok 
why is   tostring exclude  not sufficient in this case 
does this affect both eclipse and maven gradle builds 
should lombok fail to compile this piece  or should lombok just silently annotate it with   notnull  and continue on 
can you please check the problem still exists in the  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge  
can you put a complete test case in jsfiddle com or jsbin net 
what version 
does   done    do what you expect 
do you have some ideas  + miketaylr
can you provide a test case

can you reproduce it with the demo project using your own image urls 
how large are the images you download cache

how are you installing the library  follow the steps shown  here  https   github com rs sdwebimage#installation 
what is that   i'm using the latest official release

can you paste your project clj  this smells like a plugin issue  also include    lein init clj if you have one  thanks 
maybe  oliyh can provide details 
can you explain this further  what would the expected result of adding a  type pom dependency be if not to place it in the lib  directory 
can you see if this still occurs with current git master 
do you have  lein_fast_trampoline  set by any chance 
would there be any adverse effects of not declaring a direct dependency on reply other than causing one more thing to have to be downloaded at runtime 
can you try the servlet api from other sources instead 
maybe when you write   lein classpath  you could emit a warning saying if you do a pull that changes the dependencies you'll have to blow away that file manually for now 
does it simply add resources to the jar  or something more intelligent 
does git remove   git  of the submodule after it is cloned 
what error message do you get  what exactly are you running 
what do you mean by "considered"  available on classpath or executed as tests  the former can be controlled by specifying additional resource directories in the   dev  profile

can you confirm the fix in master works  thanks 
could you try doing  and print the result of that bash statement

could you please also plot the alternative 1 under default  just to see how it looks like 
which wiki do you mean 
can you post a small example that we can replicate 
which os is this 
why not just sample a continuous uniform and then threshold it  even better would be a beta  5   5  prior 
maybe a small script in the example folder 
will need more details    did you install  pymc3     conda install  c conda forge pymc3    what is the full stack trace 
what do people think about adding this as a kwarg 
would you prefer that to throwing errors when unused arguments are passed  i think it would be easy to support one or the other  but not both 
could you please move  profiling  and  live sample plots  to  how to   they are not used very frequent 
maybe  lucianopaz has an idea 
do they stall as well  if so  this may be an issue with pip  rather than pymc3  if not  though  i'm not quite sure how to debug this

where does the twig_node_expression_getmacro class come from 
could you try to define an  __isset  method and see if it works 
when do you have this error message  can you give us a small template to reproduce this  thanks 
maybe you forgot to specify an __isset method  or maybe your __get returns null 
whats the actual error message your getting  looking at the regex used in  https   github com fabpot twig blob master lib twig test integrationtestcase php#l44 it should be possible without any issues 
do you have any url 
what is the problem you are trying to solve 
does this code work with single quotation mark  try to use  code  amp quot   code

can you share a reproducer  using https   twigfiddle com  for instance   
how   does   it output 
what is your custom strategy doing  
can you show the exact exception message and its stack trace and can you also show how you registered the function and how you call it 
did you by any chance run the compiling process with php 7  the compiler generates different php code depending on the php version used during compilation 
how does your setup look like when you run into this issue  looking at the code in the  3 x  branch it seems to me that the signatures are identical 
which interface are you using in quicksilver   you can find this in preferences → appearance 
can you repeat this bug 
will that work 
did it work in 400d  or do you have to go back to 1 1 3

can you please provide a little more detail on this 
how many folders files are we talking about  at infinite depth  how many files were they picking up 
what size 
did you pick the debug or release configuration 
could you try temporarily disabling removing that plug in to see if it makes any difference 
maybe that should go into b70 
can you tell us which version of quicksilver and os x you’re using  also  if you could provide the crash report from    library logs diagnosticreports    that would help

do they have " catalog " after their name 
did you submit any crash reports 
can you be more specific 
what types of triggers do you have enabled 
would you be willing to run a test build that’s likely to log tons of messages   you’d only have to run it until you get a crash  
does this only happen _after_ you dismiss the interface and call it back up 
did you skip over 1 2 x 
which interface are you using   you can check by going to preferences → appearance  
which interface are you using  if you don’t know  you can check under preferences → appearance 
does it crash  stop running  immediately  or start  but then freeze  if it’s crashing  are there any reports in    library logs diagnosticreports  
does it steadily get worse as chrome is running  do they all go away when chrome isn’t running 
did you mean 10 12 6 or 10 13 0  in any case  go to preferences → general → handlers and make sure the file system browser is set to “finder selection” 
maybe you had "leedm777" remote from before  try deleting the remote and adding it again with  fetch   then check 
why would you want to fetch without checking it out 
why not clone the canonical project  then add forks as remotes inside that repo 
can you ask an administrator of the default team to see if they can access and delete the repo 
does releases have an api  i don't know much about them 
can you give me more information about your system version and your shell 
does the password contain characters other than alphanumeric  3  which shell  4  which terminal emulator 
do you have   usr bin ruby  and   usr bin rake  by chance  you could install them via  apt get   for example  then  sudo rake install prefix  usr  should work—if it doesn't please post more info

could you elaborate in more detail about what hub generates and why is it difficult for you to extract the pr id  thanks 
do you see   git pullreq_editmsg  kept even after a successful pr opened 
what exactly is the problem you're running into  what's its current behavior  it's worth noting that  the normal github api can  only  be accessed over https  https   developer github com v3 #schema  
do you have any suggestion how to detect this 
what are you trying to do  what have you tried so far  what hasn't worked 
do you imagine this to be an extra  optional flag to  git merge  command 
do you have any idea what happened to your     config hub   anyway  hub should probably ignore the invalid entry instead of panicking 
which version are you using  can you try the latest release from the releases page 
how do you  and other readers of this thread  expect this feature to work 
what is your os and git version  have you aliased  git hub   https   github com github hub issues 1792#issuecomment 403413131
what is a cicd environment and how is it relevant here  3  how does "declining" a pull request manifest itself  does the pr get closed  or something else 
can you check     config hub  and see if there is the  protocol  setting there  it should be missing or be  https  for api requests
what are your ideas 
do you feel that  hub pr show  should then support    format ' i'  
how do these sound 
how do you invoke  hub  from within this container 
can you verify that that token is connected to a user that has access to the  aalimov testifier  repo  often  permission problems result in 404 getting returned as a result 
how do you install hub 
which part of this project are you aiming to import  btw i've just tried  go get github com github hub  with go 1 14 and it correctly downloaded and compiled hub 2 14 2  😕

can you paste some examples  from what i can see http   doc qt io archives qt 4 8 qmake project files html they are very different from what uncrustify is doing 
how should i help if you push an example  above  different from the debug link 
could you give an example and the code that throws the error 
could you please check it and weight in  your experience with what's work and what's not would be very helpful 
what do you think  
do you use virtualenv  how do you run python  i'm guessing you are on macos  is that right 
how would you like to now proceed   stevenbird 
can anyone tell me how to fix it 
did that resolve your issue 
could you provide a sample input and desired output so that we can add to the regression test 
do you really need underscore to add a function for this 
what would it do  what are the use cases 
can you show some test cases of how the current behavior is incorrect  and how this change will fix it 
what about  _ without array  undefined  null   
what about a reference to the parent class for calling  super      i'm afraid this is a duplicate of #45 
did it previously generate a newline 
why not just  var myvar   obj subobj func p1 p2 p3     "defaultvalue"   
why not normalise the array first 
what are some real world situations in which you need to know if an element in the list passes the test     but  any  will not work 
why not just have a single  render  as your bound entry point  and then a bunch of helper functions which are called in your main render function 
what is wrong with  setinterval  
what's your other motivation  it seems to me to be pretty close to #221 et al 
what  http   esprima org demo parse html code phone_num 20 2b 2b
what would you expect it to produce and why 
what version of underscore are you using  this has been fixed since 1 8 i believe works in emulation mode at any rate     http   puu sh ovpvo 1222153aa7 png 
would you like to submit a pull request to improve the docs 
could you give an example of a benign usage of underscore that results in this error  perhaps using  jsfiddle net  jsfiddle net   
can you explain your use case  i've almost never seen a good reason to use an array this way 
what version on 0mq are you using  i've checked both maint and master and there's no zmq_device   file in doc directory in either of them 
maybe it uses some other shorthand for 127 0 0 1 
can you please whether the problem persists when using master from github 
did you recompile pyzmq after updating libzmq  you probably need to do that 
could the owner give some suggestions  
could you please send your patch as a pull request 
what i am doing wrong 
what platform  could you please provide a minimal test case that reproduces the problem  i tried but i cannot reproduce that on linux by adding another server to test_client_server cpp 
can you attach the code you used to verify this 
could you please send a pr to fix it 
does this still happen with 4 2 0 
how does the client code looks like  do you have a minimal repro for that 
could you please share the updated code  on a gist pastebin maybe to avoid excessive clutter here
can you reproduce the problem using only libzmq  if so can you share the code 
can you reproduce without using cppzmq  also it's good behaviour to close sockets before contexts anyway 
could you try and report back your findings 
could you provide more detail and or take a look at issue i linked above  thanks 
could you please send a pr to fix it as you suggested 
could you please send a pr to update the install file 
can you reproduce without pyzmq 
will you send a pr with the change  
could you please clarify what you mean

don't think so as it's part of the protocol   in what use case would more be needed 
what is the problem exactly 
why do you want to set this option for building libzmq  cf  https   blog mozilla org nnethercote 2011 01 18 the dangers of fno exceptions 
can you share a simple example to reproduce  are you sure that a socket is not being used from multiple threads  this includes create and close
could you please send a pr to fix it 
can you send a pr to update the documentation 
can you reproduce it with a minimal example using libzmq only 
could you please send a pr to update the script so that it works in both cases  thanks 
do we have any platform that doesn't even support c++03  admittedly i don't really know what the differences are exactly 
do you mean actionpack or activesupport 
what do you mean "specify it by hand"

what is the output if you put this in the example  before the line with  be_valid     pre  puts self class included_modules   pre 
where are you seeing this documentation and what version of rspec rails are you talking about 
why do you think they are not being wrapped in a transaction 
does it work if you pull that out of the module 
what version of zentest are you using 
does this pass   assigns  projects  should eq assigns  projects   
what happens if you specify the version of rspec rails in the gemfile 
what version of rails are you using  also  i'd like to see the portion of your gemfile where rspec rails is defined 
can you show me an example of the spec and code  i'm not clear on what gets expressed where 
did you upgrade from an older version  also  what version of ruby and what os 
what do you mean "the same issues"  are you getting an error saying "argumenterror  wrong number of arguments  1 for 0 " 
what do you propose 
what versions of rspec and rails were you using when this worked as you expect it to 
what happens if you add  render_views  right after  describe publicscontroller  
can i get a link to the docs you're looking at 
did you also upgrade rspec or rspec rails  if so  from what version to what version  rspec rails only just released 2 12 2  
do you feel like rspec needs syntax to support it better 
what are they using the controller's name for  https   github com rspec rspec rails blob 1d15db02c540e3987d18f0c4b48193a4401ff724 lib rspec rails example controller_example_group rb#l61 l63
what version of rspec mocks are you running  i believe this is fixed in rspec mocks 2 14 
what version were you using before and where within the tests are you trying to call the method  render_views  
can you include your original  spec_helper  which causes the problem  or point to a public repo which has it 
can you share the repository where you see this issue 
what screencast was it  was it an older version of rspec 
does the  rspec rerun  https   github com dblock rspec rerun  gem meet your needs

could you provide a reproduction script or new rails project  thanks
what is  mytype1  and  mytype2   are they ienumerable lt t gt  collections 
what functionality do you need that requires subclassing csvparser  my thought would be that you should seek from the underlying stream before you start reading in csvhelper 
did this work for you 
does it always happen or only certain scenarios  if it's a special case can you give me example code  i will look into it tonight 
does  csvhelperexception data "csvhelper"   give you any more information 
did you figure it out 
do you have a class that the file is getting mapped to  do you just want a few of the properties to be required and the other properties optional 
what version of csvhelper are you using  are you specifying an index in  firstcsvmap  or  secondcsvmap  
can you try manually referencing the dll under the windowsphone8 folder 
do you know of another way  when there is no header  i would suggest creating a mapping file and specifying the index for each property 
do you have control over the data being output  if so  you could try escaping the field with  " s 
does this setting not work in your case  http   joshclose github io csvhelper #configuration trim fields
what do you want to happen if the field has more than 300 characters 
does it still fail for you 
can you give an example of this failing  my guess is you need to flush the  streamwriter  after you've written your csv data 
do you mean during deserialization to dynamic 
can you use the constructor of the type converter to pass the information in you need 
can you give an example of an immutable type in f#  i see this in json net https   www newtonsoft com json help html deserializeimmutablecollections htm
would you be able to modify the example i gave to how you're actually using it 
can you provide a small example to reproduce the issue 
what version are you using  https   github com dotnet standard blob master docs versions md
what are you trying to do  set  "null"  as a null value for every type  only specific types  only for specific properties of your class 
what is the string that it's trying to convert into a  datetime  
can you give me all the classes you have and some sample data 
can you show the  printerconsumabledata  class you're using 
what problems are you referring to 
does the second file start where the first file left off  will it stop in the middle of a field 
maybe you can keep the parsing async and only the reading of the source memory stream async  i think that would solve everyone's problems 
do you have a property named  commonname  that doesn't have a corresponding field in the csv file 
can you provide the class structure that it's trying to map 
when you say  assembly redirecting isn a real solution for this  do you mean that doesn't work  or you like don't that solution  can you reference the netstandard2 0 assembly instead 
can you give the header row and the first data row  what is the issue with  datatable   how are you using the attributes 
what version of csvhelper is used when using framework 4 8 
can you give an example of the setup before  and the setup after  that caused a 15  slowdown 
why the hell would i want to copy html using "copy image"  such images won't be even displayed in copyq 
however  if i copy something that is already in the clipboard  isn't it just moved to the top or is this a preference that i have set 
can you check if text is in clipboard after selecting it with mouse   also exit copyq or disable selection to clipboard synchronization  
can you see incorrect shortcut created or it just doesn't work 
could this have anything to do with the issue  could you take a look at our pkgbuild and let me know if there's anything its missing  https   github com antergos antergos packages blob master copyq pkgbuild
do you mean "import and export multiple tabs" 
what's the os 
what is the os  and window manager if any   does this work in any apps  is the item at least in clipboard after activated from tray 
can you run  copyq show   to show main window  after  copyq  is started 
what is your copyq version  what character encoding does your system use 
can you check is selection is really copied with  copyq selection  command  and perhaps  xclip  o    can you also post  copyq   version  
do you want to run an automatic command when an image is copied to clipboard 
do you open the menu on host or guest os  outside or inside virtualbox  
can you update copyq  i just released v3 6 0 today 
can you try using clicking on "item   show preview" in the main window menu bar  looks like the preview enabled disabled state is not consistent with the window state 
does this mean that when you restart the application the items are sometimes loaded correctly  can you share your log   kbd f12  kbd  shortcut  
can you create new item 
can you share the command here  btw  only "in menu" commands can work with item selection    "automatic" and "global shortcut" commands work with current clipboard content 
what's the os  desktop environment and the app you paste images into 
how about watching  releases feed  https   github com hluk copyq releases atom   there is also  mailing list  https   groups google com forum # forum copyq  where i send release announcements 
did you install from  ppa  https   launchpad net  hluk +archive ubuntu copyq  
what's the app version  do you have any commands in command dialog  f6 shortcut  
what is the app you copy url from  can you try disabling the automatic commands  the ones with small clipboard icon  to see if one of them is responsible 
can you provide  copyq version  for the 3 7 2 version  maybe it's because it uses different qt version 
can you try reinstalling  copyq plugin itemweb  plugin 
did you check  this quide  http   copyq readthedocs io en latest password protection html   are there any errors in log  f12 shortcut  
did you install copyq from ppa or build it yourself  what does  copyq   version  print 
would  kbd ctrl  kbd + kbd a  kbd    kbd delete  kbd  work 
can you point out what needs to be changed in docs or ideally create a pull request 
can you post steps to reproduce this 
do you mean when mouse hovers over items only every other items is highlighted 
can you share the item content  formats and text  after you copy text and also after you copy the file  you can inspect item content with f4 shortcut 
why does it say "qt  5 11 3"  ubuntu 19 10 contains qt 5 12 4  how did you install copyq 
can you provide a screenshot  i don't think copyq has control over any icon order in the system 
do you return to ranger if you exit the shell 
did you restart ranger after changing  rc conf   i know it may be obvious but i'm just checking  definitely works for me 
maybe it's your config  if it's not your config  i'd like to have more information about your setup  os  terminal  python version  and about since when this happened 
what was  term before 
how about  xsel  o  instead of another echo 
could you please write me what you have to add to    mime types to be able to open djvu files automatically in ranger 
can i just steal yours 
can you try this  i don't remember the exact commit but the config line parsing procedure must have been changed 
maybe try  try cat " path"   mdv    c  width      dump   trim  exit 5       exit 2     then 
how exactly are you running iterm2 on linux  are you running ranger via ssh 
could you check whether #1532 fixes this 
could you try the "solution" there 
when you go into that directory is this file highlighted or not 
do you have an old  commands py   try running without configs using  ranger   clean  
did you actually start typing to start the reverse search  btw  there's the "s" mapping for this 
does w3migmdisplay work for you from the command line 
why do you prefer 0 to an actually meaningful number  it should be fairly easy to add  i just want to know why beforehand  thanks for the kind words    
maybe this could be implemented as a new command  mkcdir  
why exactly do you want to disable it though  it's a pretty useful discovery feature usually 
does it solve it for you 
did you maybe accidentally press  ctrl s   that's a terminal feature  you can unfreeze with  ctrl q  
do other programs using pillow still work  this sounds like something implemented internally to pillow

do you have a link to the specification of the  fai format 
do you have a url where i can see this happening in my own browser  you can email it to me privately if you prefer 
does it work for you in the 1 9 7 demo on jbrowse org 
does that help 
does the same thing happen on the jbrowse org sample browser  i couldn't reproduce that even on ie11
do the genes themselves not have a "name" field in your gff  you could just try this feature get 'id'  too
can you describe this a little more 
does it also happen on other jbrowse instances like the volvox sample browser 
do you have node + npm installed 
can you paste your configuration for the dataset selector
