does this repro when you wrap  rustrt  uvtask  in a rust function 
would this approach  concatenating all doc comments  be ok 
could you describe what you mean in more detail  would they be equivalent to  iter scan 0   old  next     old +  next   old       and similarly with     
how would this implementation behave when  seekfrom  start  or  seekfrom  end  is passed 
does this also happen on stable rust 
what is its version  what is its architecture    what is your rustc version  run  rustc  vv  to get output  
what did you mean by interface conversion 
when you say "an explicit cast crashes the compiler"  what notation were you using for this 
can you describe your current platform  os  ocaml versions  that kind of thing 
did this explanation help  or what is still unclear 
how does the shim solution sound 
did you mean something else 
did you run code that makes sure this is actually fixed  it wouldn't hurt to make sure 
what's the problem here 
maybe we should just stop autodereferencing for binary ops  that's not a feature i would expect 
can i get the testcase that's triggering this 
can i safely close this 
would it be possible to somehow only copy them when sending them between tasks  and use reference counting the rest of the time 
what's the failure mode here  does it just crash with an array out of bounds error  if so  that doesn't seem unreasonable to me 
do you mean something beyond src lib sort rs  or did you miss that one 
why do you think it's misreporting it   option  get  fails with that message when you call it on  none  
could you tell me where the format string is parsed and where the types of the arguments are determined 
what version of the compiler was this with  running this on 578e680 i don't get an ice on osx 
does  dwarfdump  show any debuginfo in there  i presume this is under linux because of  gdb   does the same thing occur on osx 
does this also happen in gdb 
what response would you prefer here  compile and work  or error out in the typechecker 
can you open a pull request 
can you clarify 
what version of rust are you using  can you post some source code that doesn't compile due to this issue 
how are you configuring rust  i couldn't even get libuv to build with an arm target 
do you have a test case 
what's your make version 
could you achieve this with a hof 
maybe this is a big in unique ptr unification related to 32 bit somehow 
can i get dibs on this 
why not write the code so that the constant expression refers to a non mut static  and then initialize the mut static from the newly introduced non mut static binding  
doesn't this belong in https   github com rust lang rust playpen instead 
do you need flate specifically  the snap crate is a pure rust snappy implementation 
does   prefix work for you when installing manually 
do you need this much flexibility currently for the leveldb bindings 
can you reproduce the segfault when compiling from the git master branch  0 2 is several months old 
would that work for rust 
does it start at  0 3  
do you have curl installed  if not  you'll need to install it using your package manager 
which command fails  configure  make  or make install 
does it pass tests   cc https   github com mozilla rust issues 11950  
what version of the compiler are you using  this example works for me  so there may be some old libraries lying around on the system 
can you do a make clean  update to head  currently 21be137   and try again  thanks 
could this be another use for overloaded integer literals  or would that be a bridge too far 
can you comment further  malloc takes a lock in libc    i'm not sure what the bug is here 
what is a node for a dlist 
do you have another program that does implement a trait  but shows the same bug 
do we have any idea what the bug is  really 
what part of it seems redundant 
which part of the original proposal requires ctfe 
do you have instructions for reproducing 
while that's clearly desirable for the show trait  it's not obvious that fmt  string should have that behaviour 
what about things that exist on both platforms but are different 
why not figure out number of optimal codegen units in your build system instead  also in cargo  
could possibly be #50586 
which constants 
should this bug be filed against https   github com rust lang rustup instead 
what version of rustc are you using  i would not expect this to be true on the most recent incoming  but earlier versions and master may still exhibit this behavior 
doesn't the source tarball already depend on git for llvm   libuv   i could easily be wrong  i have no idea about this  
what operating system are you using 
could you paste the output of  rust_log rustc  metadata  loader make   
can you update and try building again 
did you install gpg with your package manager   for example   brew install gpg  on a mac  
does this also mean that we could remove the logic of sometimes naming the entry point  main  and sometimes  amain  
can you show the macro definition 
what do you think   edit  this is resolved  kimundi and i had a discussion on irc  he's almost done and will continue with the work  
does it not become moot then since that's what we are going to do 
what kind of finesse do i need 
did you want us to     try to seed google with search terms or something 
can you reproduce on incoming 
does this also date back to 1 0  like #30344 did 
could you reduce the application  by commenting out unrelated chunks of code  while still retaining the bug 
what's your mingw version  seems like mingw headers lack some important definitions 
would it be possible to give more details about why these tests are failing   e g  pasted output  
do you have a full gist available  i wonder if we're trying to upload    dylib  to the emulator when we should be uploading    so    
does the same apply to getenv setenv  no race there  but task level envvars could be useful 
what happens if you add this to the top of the  test  function 
does your system have an adequate amount of memory to run all these tests in parallel 
maybe we should document this so there is no confusion 
what does this mean  when is rustdoc creating binary artifacts 
can you describe in more detail what exactly you are doing and what the desired outcome should be 
what happens if you use  enc   it's probably related to that 
do you have some example code that shows this problem in action  how long is 'very long' 
what is the error message   please try to include error messages in bug reports   you possible need  pub use self  unlock  unlock  
could you elaborate on this a little more  i'm not entirely sure what i'm looking at  although others may have better ideas   
does these libraries have link metadata that isn't converted to pkgids 
do you have any other connectivity issue 
could we remove the current condition api in favour of this  it doesn't really seem to offer anything but failing  and we already have an api returning an  option  
what version of  rustc  are you using  the following compiles successfully with  rustc 1 0 0 nightly  083b8a404 2015 04 05   built 2015 04 05  
should this also consider the case when  bar  is not marked deprecated but it is placed inside a module marked deprecated 
can i take this 
could this also be allowed as a crate attribute  and automatically apply to all public exports of that crate 
does this crash also happen on incoming 
why would it be live  because the scope of  y  is based on the block structure of the program  and not on which expressions happen to reference it 
how would this affect partialeq 
do you need help 
does this also occur when you compile the code non incrementally but with   ccodegen units 9999  
could that be the cause 
can you try this again with the latest version  i believe this has been fixed 
how would you ever refer to the type and function 
can someone on mac confirm this is fixed  and close if so 
can you use  tuple two a  b     tuple iter_bytes    
what do you mean by _currently unused_  are they unused in encoders bundled in libserialize  or existing libraries  on github   which implement  encoder  
maybe a duplicate of #20220 
why do you assume that omitting  ne  is good but omitting  gt  might not be  do we have a derive heavy crate somewhere that'd be good for compile time and runtime benchmarks 
what if  i  were mutable 
do you have a page code example please 
did you try it against the latest master 
what was the tool you used to generate this information  this may make a good regression test for rustdoc 
what do you think about these steps 
should we make this an rfc 
how do i get assigned to this 
would the idea be that  regex_macros  is renamed to  regex_plugin  or maybe just  regex  
which docs   std  result  http   doc rust lang org std result index html#the try  macro  mentions  try   
can i try to take care of this one 
do you consider this fixed   sfackler  
can we just hack around it and fall back to   dev  
what's the benefit you are expecting  when would zeroed pages help in vec 
can you elaborate on how you discovered this  it appears that breakpoints on  rust_fail  still seem to work 
what would you expect to happen here  or is this issue about unclear error message 
how much memory does the machine have 
could you run rustc under gdb and gist the backtrace from rust_task_fail 
does the first  a  currently get flagged with an  unused variable  warning 
would that be useful for this case  can anybody mentor 
can i take this bug    
what revision are you using 
do you have  gcc  somewhere in your path for  rustc  to find 
could you provide a contained example to test this out on   this block  https   github com rust lang rust blob master src librustc driver driver rs#l242 l249  looks suspiciously out of date  but i'm not sure if uncommenting it would actually work 
would this be solved by constraining the type parameter to be  send  
do you have ipv6 disabled 
could you put all of this output into a gist using  gist github com  http   gist github com   it tends to clutter the issue a bit otherwise 
can you try running  cargo clean  and then  cargo build  again 
what's the exact command you're using 
could be another case of https   github com rust lang rust issues 52992  
do you have the full xcode suite installed or just the xcode command line tools 
can you paste some of the errors that you're seeing 
can you elaborate on what you mean by this 
can you suggest a phrasing which would've been unambiguous for you 
what is the result of  ulimit  n  though  just calling  ulimit  is only the maximum file size  unless osx is different  
does  librustc_llvm  actually take a long time to build  or is linking llvm super slow    edit   for the latter we should use the   sys  convention and no higher level apis 
could you give a code example of this to aid future triagers 
what happens of you write the definition of  new_el  inline at the point of use 
do either of those ring a bell for you  also  have you tried building from a fresh checkout 
could you please edit the issue and put the report in a code section  https   help github com articles github flavored markdown#fenced code blocks that should make it more readable 
what sense it makes to implement  debug  for iterators  these can’t really show any useful state 
would you like me to post some general suggestions pointers here  or chat about it  i'm on discord zulip if you prefer the latter 
do any of those ring bells 
do you mean like  this one   https   github com rust lang rust issues 32272#issuecomment 197887534 
wouldn't this give us  some of  the advantage of  2  without the disadvantage 
do we need to tweak our opt level 3 pipeline  has it diverged from clang  is it inappropriate to run by default 
do we go back to using  rlibc  
what version of the compiler are you using  i thought i had a fix for this recently  but i may have made a mistake   
why should this not compile 
how would it prevent  arielb1's attack 
why should they be different 
should this go on the mir milestone 
what do you think  arielb1   i imagine this will cause more backwards incompatibility on the various corner cases that ast borrow check gets wrong  is one concern 
what version of  rustc  do you have 
could you combine the two staticlibs into one staticlib with a meta crate 
could you show the code that produces this 
what is the source you are running this on 
can you be sure that the 0 10 version isn't being optimized away by returning the result of  reader read_to_end    
could you give an example of how one might do this in c 
can you clarify which docs you're looking at  these all work for me locally when looking at the libstd docs 
should these kinds of small type changes include a test 
does this have a motivation that  # main   can't address 
can you investigate to see where all the space is going  "the build directory is   20gb" is tough to debug when we can't reproduce it 
would you mind specifying what set of tests you were trying to build  which test fail specifically  etc 
could you make a branch with the bug and post a link to it 
can you provide a diff between the outputs  this is likely a known issue  but i would like to be sure 
what happens if you just run bar exe without gdb 
did #24989 fix this 
what's the correct generator for visual studio 2015 in this case 
maybe the lint could avoid warning on non negative constant values  also  would it be possible to make the integer to pointer conversion perform sign extension 
could you get a stack trace from the crash dump    would recompiling llvm help     seems irrelevant 
does your  rustc  version precisely match the version of  libcore  you are compiling 
can you paste the output of  rust_log rustc  metadata  loader  
could you please provide an example which better illustrates the benefits of this syntax 
did you mean to write  unsafe impl t  send+ sized  send for foo t       granted  the error message could be better 
why can't it be derived  because of https   github com rust lang rust issues 26925 in the first place  but also because  defid  is not  default  
how are you compiling it  works fine for me with rustc 1 10 0 nightly  cd6a40017 2016 05 16   using both  cargo bench  and  rustc   cfg test  
can you provide a more self contained reproduction  i looks like this requires running  make  and downloading stuff 
what's the status of this with #20065 merged 
what actually closes this issue  is it when  int uint  is totally gone 
which steps are required 
can we  please  not shove together disparate features like this 
what's the version of gcc that haskell is providing you 
could you maybe elaborate on this a bit more 
does homebrew freak out if anything gets printed to stderr or something 
does the same thing happen with a recent nightly 
can you provide an example 
what's the motivation 
does this really need a method on box   doesn't look that bad  edit  made  b  mutable 
what is 'unbearable' 
what's the motivation 
what are file dependencies  rustc compilation is crate as a unit  this should also be an rfc rather than an issue   the design is not obvious 
where do you have the nightly installed  there have historically been some bad interactions involving symlinked  so's 
can you provide some contextual information such as rustc version and platform you're running on  i cannot reproduce the segfault you've mentioned on either osx or ubuntu 
can we add a trick to hair that treats  box  new  calls just like the  box  syntax 
does  set msystem mingw32  help 
could you provide a smaller example which triggers this error  if not  we could use  creduce  as well to slim down this use case 
what does  cargo build   verbose  say 
would you mind submitting it as a pull request 
could you provide a gdb stack trace as well 
can you confirm that this is still an issue 
do you have stale libraries lying around that have been there for upwards of a month causing this problem 
could you provide some steps to reproduce  with a  staticlib  output the  libmorestack  library should be included  so you shouldn't have these undefined symbols 
should it be expanded to cover other kinds of behavior  also see discussion in https   github com rust lang rust issues 25977#issuecomment 135999955
do you have the  snappy  library installed on your system 
does rust currently run on haiku 
can you provide the code to reproduce this as well 
could you run  cargo build  again with  rust_backtrace 1      rust_backtrace 1 cargo build   and post the backtrace here 
can you show some code that reproduces this 
can you provide the full example of code to reproduce the ice 
can you paste the error that the linker emits 
may i ask what version of  rustc  you're compiling your code with   if you're unsure  you can get it via  rustc  v   i think 
why ubuntu 12 04  it is eol for 3 years already 
does that work for you 
can you post a screenshot  and browser platform  this looks fine to me 
didn't we also use a custom hasher to bypass randomness  if we rely on  hashbrown  we must make sure its  compile time  randomness is disabled 
what version of rustc were you building  all these versions have been removed on master 
does this serve your purpose 
does it miss it specifically for the json output 
does this also happen without lto 
does rhel6 support a c++11 compiler  if you install one  then rustc will likely work 
can you explain how you think  x    0  should warn  the comparison can legitimately return true whereas  x   0  can never return true 
would that be useful to you 
would "deny   foo   and all attempts to override" be clearer 
what happens if you continue after gdb stops on the segfault 
what's special about n 0  33 
could you provide the code that causes the ice as well 
doesn't that sound explicit enough 
what version of the compiler are you using  your repository compiles ok for me with  rustc 0 12 0 pre nightly  711d71027 2014 08 22 00 56 00 +0000    but this may have been a recent regression 
which output buffers are not flushed  we register atexit handlers to take care of the global stdout buffer  https   github com rust lang rust blob master src libstd io lazy rs#l53  and stderr is unbuffered 
what is the "shared ownership guide"  i think this text is from the api docs of rc  yes 
do you have a generated wayland_c_interfaces rs at hand  if not i'll have a look tomorrow
could you clarify what the undefined behavior you're seeing is  this is just a standard panic for me 
do you happen to have a code example that causes this 
can you post the sha of the commit when you observed this for future reference 
what problems are you having with it  are you sure you don't just need to  cargo update  p uuid  
cannot it match enosys or eperm just like getrandom syscall does  https   github com rust lang rust blob ad7c55e1fc55d9af4787b285cec1c64e3480ae84 src libstd sys unix rand rs#l51
do you have a simple test case 
what am i missing here 
do you happen to have a code example that triggers this 
maybe some  zip optimizations  https   users rust lang org t how to zip two slices efficiently 2048  can help 
does anyone actually need want this 
could you provide some code that reproduces the error 
maybe you can write a pr with a test case so that this gets addressed 
may that's the cause  could you try with one codegen unit  as for the improvement in 1 25 0  you might thank the llvm update for it    
which fcgi code is this  i can't find a recent version  that compiles 
why is there a space between  get_client_handle  and  query  and not between the other functions  i'm in favor of simply adding some space between the function definitions 
does that make sense  i'm gonna close this as it's intended behavior  but i'll of course answer any questions you may have 
did you compile with debuginfo   or with optimisations  
do we require storagelive before using locals  or is the storagedead without a storagelive problematic 
can i take this one if no one is working on that  
can i take this up  because it has an e mentor tab 😄   
do you mean  slice  instead of  scalarpair  
what do we do for  impl trait  here 
what would you like this to output 
does this have any consequences re  promotion or const checking  the rules for that are currently difference for consts and const fns 
do you have a backtrace  which code is responsible for iceing here and how hard bad would it be to just error instead 
may be trans   this  https   github com rust lang rust blob d70cd490711509707085e043d18b9862436407f8 src librustc_trans common rs#l234  for example 
maybe a "sanity check" could be implemented when parsing environment variables so these kind of errors could be mitigated 
could you provide some source code  if you are using associated types  this could be #18048  ice  when cross crate importing trait with associated types 
what’s wrong with simply calling  default  default    
would you be ok opening an issue over there instead 
does this perhaps have to do with #27626 
could you move this to https   github com rust lang book please  thanks 
do you have some source code that we could poke around with  this may just entail an annotation on a call to  collect  
wouldn't it be easier to just crosscompile rather than complicating rustc codegen to generate target independent ir 
do you happen to have a code example that causes this ice 
can you list the signatures of the lang items you implemented  implementing them improperly can cause compiler crashes ice s 
maybe the lint triggers on casting away mutability  can you minimize your example to have no dependencies 
did you perhaps paste the wrong thing 
would it be possible to backport #41130 
can you share any of your code 
maybe the travis machines were just getting unlucky 
what do we think about removing this warning entirely  and updating  rustc  h  and the man page to reflect this behavior 
did this end up happening 
what do you have in mind that is noreturn and doesn't eventually emit a  ud2  
could you provide a backtrace 
what to do with it 
would it be reasonable to make an exception for  _  if the characters directly before and after are digits 
did you mean for your error code to spell out "boob" or is that a coincidence and the error code has some other semantic meaning to your program 
maybe it's a problem that encodeutf8  next   isn't marked  # inline    or are you not running into that issue because you're writing code inside libstd 
what would resolve this ticket  then 
why does it take so long  just the sheer size 
do you have  cc clang   however  the gcc rs crate will fall back on that environment variable before checking the built in variables 
where are these comments from  anyway  sounds like a case for the new panic safe slicing stuff  #36340  
maybe a malformed  rust_log   we're clearly landing prs so doesn't seem like it's fundamentally broken   
maybe we could configure travis to use that  this could be  and i assume it is  a temporary malfunction 
docs team triage  second  durka 's question   nagisa   that's what you're referring to 
what happens if the last item isn't a null byte 
maybe https   github com rust lang rust pull 59752 is related 
could you provide a short example on which i could easily please  as far as i can tell   # doc hidden    items aren't generated 
what version were you using 
how many architectures support double width atomics in the cpu   x86 64 with  cmpxchg16b  is one  
can you say more about this use case  i don't quite understand 
how much memory does your computer have  rust can unfortunately take 2gb  or more  to do the full bootstrap 
do the above steps sound ok to you  also  cc  japaric
do you have an example why this is useful    string  coerces to   str  so there is no need to implement this  also https   stackoverflow com questions 40006219 
does #47460 do everything you wanted 
can we add a mutable equivalent  like  fn get_key_value_mut q   mut self   q     option   k   mut v     or has that already been discussed 
could you please show some use cases for this  they are also probably going to be useful as examples in the documentation 
can you share the code please 
does this already work 
did you try a clean re build of your project 
should that information be displayed more prominently   might be another issue  sorry of this is too off topic  
what rust version is that  can't reproduce on the  playpen  https   is gd 5u9z5s 
wouldn't this break compiler plugins   including procedural macros  unless and until those move into separate processes   rust code compiled for windows gnu can't link with compiler libraries compiled for windows msvc 
do you have a standalone example that exhibits this behavior as well 
shouldn't the compiler warn you if you don't use it 
should  dyn copy + copy  be allowed  + order dependence in trait objects wrt  the "principal trait"  e g  should  dyn send + copy  be allowed 
do you have an example of where it'd be useful  in such cases  i'm afraid of side effects of unwanted replacements or maybe users' misunderstanding 
where do we use named pipes 
wouldn't it be better to make that test a  run pass   marked with  min llvm version 7 0   or maybe  run pass  with the known broken parts fixme commented out 
maybe it should start out as an allow by default clippy lint 
could you minimize the failing code in a small program 
how do we expect linker to know about abi  target features or vector ness is not encoded into symbols at all 
maybe one of the two uses an old version 
what i would do is add a note instead if  t   copy    "note   t  is not  copy   perhaps it should be "  seems cleaner to implement that way 
how did you compile the rust code  it looks like you passed    emit obj   but that isn't pulling in upstream dependencies  so you may want to consider using    crate type staticlib  instead 
did you use pest_derive  parser   
should we close it  steveklabnik  
can you elaborate on this  it does say the word 'prelude'  and links to the module documentation for it  which covers it further 
does  cargo run  not work here 
do you perhaps have your shell set up to append something like    color always  to all  rustc  commands 
can you check 
should a hash of the  parsed and normalized  target spec be used  instead 
can you please include a backtrace in the message       
can you share the code that reproduces this 
could you summarize the steps to take to reproduce this as well 
can you pass the extra flags to valgrind  it's possible that this could just be a bunch of false positives
why not just make that case a well defined compile error 
what's the problem   bar  is indeed  pub  
what the heck  a core dump after a  cat_expr errd     
what _specifically_ is the action to take here  is it about a better error message  or explaining what's going on 
could you ask over there please  thanks 
would you mind running things with  rustflags  ztime passes   the output of that would provide some useful information where the compiler spends its time during re compilation 
how is  examples channel_service rs  used  cargo has never read dependencies from a virtual manifest  so an error was added to indicate the format is not valid  https   github com rust lang cargo pull 6276  
how about a  take_until  
does using  extern "c" fn process      make a difference 
what level of this should be allowed  we don't borrowck statics  so you can do    mut a   mut a   
could you maybe try to reduce the case down a bit more 
do you think it's a trap even with the bufreader  it's surprisingly good 
do you want me to experiment here 
however  to avoid issues like this in the future  it may make sense to add "eperm" to the fallback error cases here https   github com rust lang rust blob master src libstd sys unix fs rs#l905 what do you think 
could you please look into taking care of netbsd as well 
how should this be fixed 
who really knows what the type system is up to these days    
what do you mean by a 'super trait' 
could you provide more information  see https   github com rust lang rust blob master contributing md
could you provide some more information  what commands did you use  etc 
does this happen in both debug mode and release mode 
what's the difference between this and #32195  accidental duplicate 
does this happen with your code only  if yes  can you show    does it happen with every code  e g   fn main    println  "hello "     
could you be more specific  e g  what source  in what way does it fail to run 
does this reproduce on a clean rebuild 
can you access the variant at all  if the method is missing 
could async fns after https   github com rust lang rust pull 69033 have such an explicit  drop  too or would they still be affected if https   github com rust lang rust issues 69663 was fixed 
what platform are you running on 
can you run  cargo build   verbose  and post the output 
wouldn't cargo support to pass these flags be the easiest solution 
would you be able to debug a bit and explore why the double panic is happening   e g  the panic messages that were printed or the stack traces 
wouldn't serialization libraries want accuracy more than pleasing human readers 
should be fine to display the elements    probably an oversight 
do you have a way to try this build using the upstream binaries for stage0   just for comparison 
do you mean something like https   github com rust lang rust pull 42363 
would this be fixed by simply not using  config mk  at all and having  configure  create  config toml  instead  https   github com rust lang rust issues 40730
can you try with   z fuel test 0   this will let us know if it is due to field reordering new in 1 18 
can you explain what exactly you find confusing and why 
can you provide a small example 
why does the compile dlopen   anything from the source tree   and why does anything dlopen   libc  
maybe a dupe 
why are you trying to do this  if you're distributing dynamic libraries anyway  why not just include libstd dylib in your distribution 
how is that  the closures calculate thread handles which are then collected by  collect    
do you have two consecutive commits somewhere that trigger the problem 
can you post the full output 
could you post the output of  rustc   version  
does it also happen on nightly  is there an older stable version for which this doesn't happen 
does it occur more than once   e g  can you reproduce it  
why is there a distinction between these two 
maybe it would make sense to have a separate  label  marker for the labels 
why is this not a bug in pthread mutexes  is it unspecified if a lock is reentrant by default 
which version of rustc and llvm are you using  does it error the same way if you use "stdcall"  what about on arm64  can you get a backtrace 
what did you pass to   configure 
maybe "as name" would be better to just match the other tabs 
what would happen if there are multiple 2s 
what do you mean by "redundant closure"  the same thing clippy's   b  eta reduction lint already warns against 
what does "equality in both directions" even mean 
why is that not the case then  there’s even a  in libstd lib rs…
why are float literals restricted as well 
why is that even an error 
do i have to adapt my implementation to help rust finding the appropriate  min  
do you know if there's a enhancement request for indexset trait  or a rfc 
don't the examples already answer that 
maybe the libc definition of  _sc_pagesize  was wrong as well  maybe the abi is wrong  i guess it could be a number of factors 
does anyone know of a resource explaining the terms 'covariant' and 'invariant' in this context 
do you have a small piece of code that you can show us that leads to the panic 
which version   safari  rustdoc 
which version of rustc are you using 
do you have any link explaining this stuff and what we need to do 
could you try updating your code to the most recent nightly so i can test against a rustc with that llvm 
where does this stop and end 
did you try it  that syntax should just work  iirc   i ever use it  i prefer the individual declarations  
did you forget a step in the reproduction 
what's the error message if you have any  how did you install it  don't forget to add these information if you want help 
what's the context for this issue 
can i give this a go   rustbot claim
could you provide a snippet to reproduce the problem 
why are you trying to install rust to "my documents" 
did you try the latest gdb  rust is a powerful language but not that powerful     ctrl + c  or  d  doesn't work 
what about the use case of having multiple crates and running some wrapper  test_all_crates  test_name   script which only might match some tests from one crate 
do you still want that fixed  or is this good enough  as i understand  the bug was never in any release 
can't the same  separate loop for each "chain component"  be achieved in a more general way with the existing "inner iteration" methods like  for_each  
can you give a self contained example that reproduces the bug  i can't reproduce this on playpen 
does this also happen when running  cargo check  or  cargo build  
maybe it's parsed as an expression and the remainder is thrown away  like macros used to do  
could you collect a stacktrace  something like this should work 
can you give me a counter example 
maybe a reasonable approach would be to implement such a shadowing check for macros imported from extern crates and  eventually  to check for unused locally defined macros  cc  nrc  kmcallister
can you paste the output of  ldd  on the binary as well 
doesn’t fixing the former require fixing the latter  while the end result is two different kinds of improvement  they’re very related 
can you please edit your post and remove them    
can you try different  opt level  and check how the situation changes 
could you perhaps try to get stack traces for when jemalloc starts deteting violations 
what machine is it running on 
maybe we should use "self type" instead of "receiver" 
maybe related to https   github com rust lang rust issues 51130  
could you explain in detail though the steps needed to reproduce this  it's somewhat unclear to me how you got the directory structure so far 
however  this report would be better filed on rustup itself  https   github com rust lang nursery rustup rs  would you mind re filing over there  please  thank you 
could you please file this against https   github com rust lang rust www  thanks 
what do you think 
could you also provide details about how you're linking the dll into an executable and running it 
can we just derive it 
where is this link on the page 
do you have an example of this behaviour we can look at 
can i ask  why do you need to keep all these 8gb of wiki data inside the executable instead of reading them dynamically from some other file instead 
does this error also occur if you compile without clippy 
can you try it with the newest rust nightly 
did you compile in release mode 
would you mind testing it against your codebase 
does this same code work without issue on stable 
can we get a link to the crate that is failing 
when is that  none  value read 
how do we make an example where the adapter shows up more than once 
how would you get panic backtraces on stable 
should this be closed in favor of https   github com rust lang rust issues 43081 
what do you think 
how is a syscall supported in a  core  environment  i don't think that that will make sense
why 
do you have  rust_log info  set  https   github com rust lang rust blob 844bc65333184f90670e950233513e5c7bf0572e src librustc_driver driver rs#l312
what's your point of  type error refers to wrong type  
does the ice occur on nightly  based on the failed assert  it might have already been fixed by #62233
can you try running with  cargo rustc  ztime passes  
what's problem 
what version of rustc were you compiling and or running  there's a known pre 1 11 0 bug which we believe causes an issue like this 
would you mind re filing at rust lang cargo 
maybe it is a convention 
would you mind re testing with the latest nightly 
can you try repro'ing this in clang  if it happens there too  then it's an llvm issue  not a rust issue 
maybe rust references are different enough from other languages that we should call them differently  borrows instead of references 
how the heck did that happen  there is  in fact  no source in   dev null   what is in   cargo config  
what if i defined my own type that implemented  std  ops  rem rhs   usize  + rand  rand   that type would also work in this situation 
does it cause any problem  afaict it just gives you a weird way to declare  main   but no new capability 
did you mean to use  # allow non_snake_case    instead 
what is the timing if you use the following implementation for hypot 
should we check the length of the unused variable's name to see if it is  lets say  longer shorter than 2 and if it is suggest replacing with  _  
what do you expect otherwise 
can you share your use cases 
does it happen for you outside of mingw 
what do gcc and clang do  can you explain more about your use case and why you expect this to happen 
did you mean  option  copied  in the first sentence 
what system are you on   to help in reproducing this 
do you want it to show all available methods and implementations in the code block at the top 
would you mind giving it another try with the latest nightly 
which ones are you talking about 
why not rely on that when code like this is on a hot path for you 
why not use    dividend checked_rem  divisor  unwrap_or 0    https   doc rust lang org std primitive i32 html#method checked_rem  
what was the c code that you were using 
why should macros get special dispensation to skip it 
could you check the code on the latest nightly 
can you post the full code or an example in the playground  when i try running a simplified example i see the expected line number 
could you file this against https   github com rust lang rust by example please  thanks 
did you mean  blocking  as opposed to nonblocking  if so  indeed 
could you please also provide the inline asm that triggered this panic 
do you pass    disable rustbuild  to    configure   it looks like you are using  rustbuild  and it doesn't define all these  check stage1 crate  rules 
do you have some example memory unsafety though 
can you remove the target directory and rebuild without it 
would you mind refiling against https   github com rust lang cargo    thanks 
did you mean aarch64 unknown linux gnu 
what does strace output look like 
can you try to reproduce this in play rust lang org please  i just removed it from the code you posted and that didn't fix the errors  https   play rust lang org  gist 19155d33367fd16f9a296a71ec099769 version stable backtrace 0
can you provide a  mcve  https   stackoverflow com help mcve  
how is this unsound  linker errors aren't great  but how do they jeopardize memory safety in any way 
does that sounds like a good start 
might be #40593  a fix for that has been merged about a week ago  can you try to reproduce on a current nightly 
which  rustc  version are you using 
does the problem still exist in the new stable  1 16   in the new beta  1 17  
does the error also occur when you choose a different name for  struct bar   so that it doesn't have the same name as the enum variant  bar   
can you test using the newest nightly 
can we see the rest of the code  especially around line 46 
which  rustup   version  were you using  this reminds me of a rustup bug quite some time ago which occurred when telemetry was enabled 
could you provide the entire function for context      especially depends on the signature of the function it is in 
did you remember to get a cross compiling gcc toolchain that  targets  linux  remember that mingw is for targeting windows  not for cross compiling to linux from windows 
what about  arm  and  arm64   aren't they also affected  https   github com rust lang rust blob 79b25c666fecc908539087918131d6a56e669312 src tools compiletest src util rs#l37 l38
could you post the full log  i suspect this isn't a problem with rustbuild  but with cargo  but tagging as rustbuild since it's the best approximation 
what do you want to check  there is no such thing as an empty char 
doesn't  clone  require that the result have the same lifetime as the original value  if so  then the suggested change would not work 
do you have a perhaps more isolated reproduction of this  a naive attempt to reproduce this locally  cargo build twice and see what changes  unfortunately wasn't able to reproduce this 
could you clarify what specifically is the problem with that implementation 
does the error still happen if you set stream_array_size to something much smaller 
what do you think  what error message would you have liked to see  in an ideal world 
can you try providing a backtrace or moving to a newer nightly 
maybe  target double  target main o target debug  double_input   
what is the problem here  overflow checks are only present in debug mode 
which version of  rustdoc  did you use to generate these docs 
does making it  pub extern  help vs  pub fn  
can you attach a debugger after it's hung and get backtraces for all threads 
maybe this is related to #40454  
can you give any sort of link to code that reproduces the problem 
can you try passing   c target feature  crt static   see second subpoint of point 5 of https   github com rust lang rust pull 40113#issuecomment 323193341

can i have the error log for rspec  
can someone with a mac test this 
what's the content of  hello rs   is this only happening on a recent  nightly   or did it happen before  does  stable  produce the same error 
could be part of the unused attribute lint  potentially related  #14407 and #14408
maybe  no idea 
can you explain where you're seeing separate target dirs 
can you try with gnu ld instead of lld 
does it work when specifying an absolute path  maybe cargo runs rustc in an unexpected working dir

what specifically would make the suggestion better 
maybe you can produce a backtrace 
where is the code  which rust version are you using  what commands are you running to reproduce this 
what's your build platform and your  config toml   are you using a custom llvm or the one shipped with rust 
can you provide your build command  are you building on x86_64 unknown linux gnu and targeting armv7 linux androideabi  trying to build a full compiler for that platform 
maybe https   github com rust lang rust pull 70896 
did you try other nightlies as well 
does  rustfix  apply  maybeincorrect  suggestions  if not  this should be only included for  machineapplicable  suggestions  cc  killercup
does this even have anything to do with nll  i think  rfc 2005 match ergonomics  https   github com rust lang rfcs blob master text 2005 match ergonomics md  is the only problematic new feature at play here 
why not use a folder like c  a so that it works 
which pre built binary from which site 
should it lower to some architecture specific abort instruction  sequence   should we document what that sequence looks like  or would eg  an infinite loop also be a correct implementation 
should we have a stable portable function for this in libcore 
could you check with the latest nightly if this still happens  there was a regression affecting clippy a few days ago  thanks

which crate is providing the  gpio  module type here 
what are you looking for specifically  if it's unix specific  have a look at the  libc  https   docs rs libc  and  nix  https   docs rs libc  crates 
could you clarify if that's the same as your configuration 
would using rust nightly  which contains a fix for #48967  solve the problem 
should this check if there is only one char in the input 
can you confirm that the nightly version works 
can you comment on the await rfc pr or once it merged  the tracking issue  language decisions should always happen there 
can you run it under  strace  to see its actual syscalls  debug and release builds  should  be identical in this respect  apart from different memory addresses between runs 
did you remember to make sure when installing the vc++ build tools that you enabled the windows sdk option 
could you also try to delete   home celluloce  rustup downloads 58d2e6c167c0a7d5fb4f76cc57ce65bd08c93e34bbfb97177523c9db49468a9a partial  and update again 
do you also use the 32 bit toolchain on other platforms  or only on windows 
could you run  cargo rustc     vv  on the directory of your package to ensure the nightly rustc is used

do you have lto active 
do you have the "missing" library in  lib librustc_driver 329ba9d6c8478143 so

can you recreate this in a different way so i can easily run it 
can you gist a recreation  i don't see the exception happening
can you create a simple curl recreation that fills coucdb with the data that causes this failure 
maybe  the mime type should be used  i can change it and you can test it out if you want  here are the variants  http   jackson codehaus org 1 6 0 javadoc org codehaus jackson base64variants html

does that sound reasonable 
can you be more specific about how to see what you're seeing 
does that sound like it would work for your use case  i'll work on getting this in 
can you post the exception you see in the logs  alternatively  can you create a full gist recreation  i can't recreate it here  
do you feel like sending a pull request there with your changes  closing the issue here since it refers to the documentation 
could you check this script https   gist github com 3984632 to see if you are doing anything differently 
could you clarify it a bit 
would you fancy opening a pr to fix this 
what version of es are you using 
which version are you running or upgrading from to 
do you have the stack trace in the logs by any chance 
which way should this go 
can you post a recreation please 
can you give any examples where this might not be the case 
can you please post your queries  what works and what doesn't 
do you always need this on the same field  or sometimes on two fields as well  if one field is a source and the other field a destination  
should we only allow default timeouts for hard timeouts 
can you upload your logs from master from before the scroll started 
can you gist the logs from the server  plus a complete curl recreation of the problem 
could this be because of the stop word  no  
when does it make sense to round up instead of down 
can you also post the c++ code for the request  ps  i don't see minimum_master_nodes set anywhere do you set it somewhere 
did you upgrade or restart the cluster before it happend 
can you create a curl recreation of this problem 
can you give an example of what the output of this aggregation should look like  given these 4 json documents 
can you try that  like this   simon
could you provide a gist of what you are doing 
can i see the actual id value 
don't you mean  analyzer  
can you run a  mvn clean  and see if 4 2 1 is not pulled  what kind of error are you getting 
which version are you using 
can you elaborate on the usecase 
what are you looking for exactly 
will this also be fixed on the 1 4 branch 
what default install  jna works with the  zip file just fine on windows  if its not working  then there is a misconfiguration and we should understand why its not working 
can you confirm if the problem persists  and if so  give some more reproduction steps 
what's your ideal expected behavior 
does this query work well for you so far 
can you share an example of when you run into it 
can you provide an example request 
can you make sure you are using elasticsearch 0 90 1 and provide a test case that demonstrates the problem 
could you please ask your question on the mailing list and close this issue  http   www elasticsearch org help 
can't you use an alias for those indices 
can you confirm that with 0 20 you didn't expect the numbers to be highlighted even if they were part of the query   0 20 doesn't look able to do so 
does it make sense 
what is the actual problem that you experienced with the current shading of joda 
maybe post an example too 
could you provide more information as to what you are doing and what incorrect results you are seeing  thanks
why not using http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current indices delete mapping html  
do you have some practical real world examples of how you would use this 
could you elaborate on use cases 
can you elaborate on what is wrong with this request 
whats wrong with that  its intentional 
what version are you experiencing this on 
what do you mean when you say its not responsive  to which operations does not it not respond 
should i try with more indexing  i tried indexing 1000 items without any change   any other things i might try 
does this also happen with 0 90 2  thanks 
do you ever run updates on these docs  could you send the output of this command please 
maybe you need to include that in your jboss application as well 
would you mind posting a  curl recreation  http   www elasticsearch org help   
which version did you upgrade from  any chance it was 1 2 0 
when the query returns 0 results prematurely  do you have shard failures in the response 
why not just expose a getter for  indexqueryparser  from the parse context  the fact that its package private is not really needed i think 
could you please post your question to our forums at https   discuss elastic co    thanks 
what are you missing 
did you restart elasticsearch after creating this script  does user that elasticsearch is running under have read permissions for this file and demo directory 
can you elaborate on this a bit or come up with an example 
why migrate to  not  when you're just going to have to repeat the migration for the next version anyway 
which version are you running 
can you please try out the master 0 90 branch and let us know whether it works for you or not  thanks 
can you please confirm 
could you describe your use case 
what queries did you run to compare both versions  it would also be interesting to know the size of your documents 
do we need action level granularity or would it be enough in most cases to just be able to specify which cluster to use when there is ambiguity 
what's the total size 
can you please check if you still feel this case is needed and if not close it  thx  boaz
can you give a concrete example using documents and queries  i think it will help understanding the need for the request   perhaps offer an alternative 
do you see any other errors in your log files by any chance 
could you try explaining a bit more 
did you update any settings at all before shutdown 
could you please clarify if you have tried this and whether this works for you  thanks 
maybe  dynamic templates  http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current mapping root object type html#_dynamic_templates  is what you are looking for  if so please close this issue 
does that help 
do you see "too many open files" in the logs somewhere  also check this link  http   stackoverflow com questions 15903105 too many open files warning from elasticsearch
can you elaborate about your setup 
may be should ignore dirs and only take into account files whatever the extension is 
does this also keep holding on to the bloom filter if you wait until all the searches are gone our of scope 
do you have some monitoring data of garbage collection activity   memory usage of the jvm 
do you run into this problem with windows with java 7  can you try to start elasticsearch like this   does this change anything 
could you check if that fixes the issue 
can you try if that fixes the problem 
do all your documents have multiple values for the hours field 
can you post   _cluster state filter_metadata  and   _nodes all  somewhere 
what do you think about just providing the list of commands without any   help  
can you give some more information about what happened 
do you plan to send a pr for this mark 
how would you suggest adapting the text  note that this has changed in master  where this flag has been replaced with explicit commands  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference master cluster reroute html  
why would we need an explain function on top of this 
can you maybe provide a full gist that reproduces the issue with curl commands  this would be great  i'd also be curious what version you are using 
can you provide example urls for this please  it's not clear which misses what  thanks
do you have lucene jars on your classpath 
how many nodes and shards do you have  do you use dedicated master nodes 
do you have any other copies  i e   replicas  of the shards on disks somewhere 
what version of elasticsearch are you using 
which version of elasticsearch is it  how do you index documents  using bulk or individual index requests   can you create a script that reproduces the issue on an empty cluster 
could you be more specific about what you need changed and why   and i assume you're referring to 2 0  
can try it out without docker  just to see whether it's docker related or something else is the cause 
would you mind testing it out once released and reporting back if you see similar problems 
did you do any changes in your  elasticsearch yml  configuration file  did you disable http 
could you check if you get better response times if you pass   execution_hint  map   http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current search aggregations bucket terms aggregation html#_execution_hint  to the terms aggregation 
why not sending a pr   wanna do it  
does that work  i get  missingpropertyexception no such property  _version for class  script1   when i try a script 
why would we warn on that  this sounds like a user problem 
could you explain a bit more why you would like to have this  pickypg  
maybe we should rather improve our docs and our examples on creating uris the right way 
maybe  or perhaps it should simply be rejected as an invalid request 
can i work on this 
would it be possible to copy the index into a node with 1 7 2 and try the query there  to see if the problem still exists 
double checking  i assume you are talking about the  transportclient   right 
could you list which plugins   versions do you have 
do you have more information about the use case 
what makes you think that we can't parse it properly 
what is the use case  the only purpose of a charfilter is to "hack" the text before the tokenizer  and most tokenizers don't care about case 
could you suggest how to clarify this further 
how about including the node name in the rejection exception instead  would that be enough 
can you explain what we should clarify in the description  
can you please provide us with all the mappings that you have on the  my_index  index 
what is particular to this endpoint that it causes a problem 
does that work for you  spalger 
do you really see the score bein a sum 
can you share your mappings  and potentially your index  
could be that you ran into this issue  https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch pull 5623 do you still have the mappings of logstash pro endeca 2014 04 13 from after the restart before copying the mappings back 
how can i help  this   _looks  _ easy enough for a newcomer like me 
would this also make the choice for which doc values implementation https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 11887  to use more obvious 
can you make some examples or have your marketing folks do it  examples are yummy because they become unit tests 
what type of sorting did you expect 
what about paging in these cases 
can you verify if it works now for you  cheers 
what exactly are you trying to do and where exactly is the problem you are having 
can you tell if that works in  1 1 0  or didn't you try it there 
how would this change help you  you can always check the message for indexalreadyexists 
do you use any index time scripts 
can you elaborate a bit more about what you did to make it fail without it  a demo html page which fails will be great 
would it work for you if we allowed to configure a maximum size 
did you determine whether this happened when you weren't using the custom plugin 
which version of elasticsearch was it  did you shutdown entire cluster or just the master node 
why this 
can you please share your mappings and some sample documents to reproduce the issue 
can you try and run it without setting anything around the operation threading model on any api 
could you investigate this method and see what is different about docker that causes ssd detection to fail 
could you provide the rest command you used  it would make it easier for meto test and understand the issue 
did you see any error in your logs  i quickly tried out a mvel script in a script filter and that works out 
can you paste the stack trace from the logs  it may be related to this issue  #5048
did you run out of disk space at some time  or have an oom exception in the past 
what are you planning on indexing into that field  i'm not sure that any other field type  including geo_point  can make sense of geojson 
what version are you using  are you able to produce a simple replication of this with v1 3 4  thanks
did you restart the master node while the snapshot was running 
could you try out 1 3 2 and confirm that it fixes the issue for you 
why not just let it happen when it needs to 
what value are you setting to  client transport ignore_cluster_name  
can you share your code  so we can reproduce your problem 
could you provide some examples of the messages you used 
why did documents get rejected in the first place  why would refresh help here 
could you download elasticsearch 2 3 4 and see whether it reports your file system stats correctly please 
how this can be done in java 
can you confirm that you are attempting this with  _bond0  instead of  _bond0_   it should be the latter   if so  would you be able to try  _bond0_  
how did you install marvel  can you post your elasticsearch yml file as well 
what's the problem with that 
which version is it 
what is it that you are actually trying to achieve 
can you post your field mappings 
would you like to send a pr for this 
why would we add it for this 
should we close the old one as a duplicate 
however  i wonder what your use case is  what do you need the function results for 
does it matter 
do you see any "now throttling indexing" messages in your node console logs  maybe try increasing the store throttling  defaults to 20 mb sec   http   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 1 4 index modules store html
however it seems that #7598 has not been merged for almost three months 
does your test create threads that are not being joined 
what do you mean by "matched" here  matched in the term dictionary or matched by the query 
do you use "lucene analyzers" 3 6 2 with elasticsearch 1 4 1  it does not work  elasticsearch 1 4 1 require lucene 4 10 2 
while we're talking about it  any reason you can think of for not making detect_noop the default in master 
could you describe a bit more what you are doing  "curl recreation" for example 
could we detect that java_home is not set and fail 
do you want to create a pull request with your change 
do you really need something else than that 
why is linux's handling incorrect  how does the problem manifest itself in elasticsearch  what changes should be made to elasticsearch to fix it  thanks
can anyone explain the strange behaviour 
how big is your cluster  node count  index count  shards and replicas  total data size  heap size  es version  what is your config 
could you try running a memory diagnostics test to rule faulty memory out 
may be you are using a termquery on  iso  with  de  as a term which obviously won't work  closing but feel free to reopen with more details 
would you be interested in sending a pr 
can chance you can give us a concrete reproduction or at the very least the exact api calls you used 
what does your template look like 
what does the cluster health api report during the period that the index is unavailable 
how does it affect you 
might make it easier to interface with other packages  not sure   it's very un es to emit non json   
can you elaborate on the implications of this 
can you give more details about your use case  is there any reason why the  _search  api would not work 
what is the reason behind using doc values in the percolator  the performance should be better since #7081 got in 
how did you install java  where is it installed 
do you want to create a pr making indexupgraderonemerge have a delegate onemerge instead of calling the current super 
can you say what you're trying to accomplish and maybe i can point you to the right settings 
what version of es are you using and what operating system are you using  it sounds like you are using either the rpm or deb package as well 
what would you suggest renaming the chart to in order to make it clearer  given this context 
which version are you on  could you send a complete curl recreation that shows the problem please 
can you show the output of  get  _cluster settings include_defaults true filter_path    flood_stage pretty true  and  get  _nodes settings filter_path    flood_stage pretty true  
what do they test exactly and how  anymore info on the error that you get back  e g  the whole stacktrace  
which exact file did you download  how did you install it  on which os 
can you please post again the output without the experimentalhighlighterplugin 
can you send your mapping please 
maybe we should chop it to the first 50 failures or so  something you can control with a url parameter 
can you share your query  cc  elastic es search aggs
can you share the groovy script that you are using in your search request 
will this block the 5 0 release  it seems as though it should  since resiliency is one of the features being heavily touted in the new version  
can you share full configs  elasticsearch yml   what does your upgrade process look like 
which document 
do you have any custom plugins installed  was anything else out of order before this started happening 
which version are you using  i think _type is not configurable for now   typefieldmapper  https   github com elastic elasticsearch blob e0708813a9228c4d69af5b94bdf263c2bc7945ed core src main java org elasticsearch index mapper internal typefieldmapper java#l97 
did you upgrade and downgrade again by any chance 
what do you think 
do you think we should document these contexts along side the documentation for the api that they are used in 
did you set the proxy as explained in the  docs  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch plugins 6 0 _other_command_line_parameters html#_proxy_settings   your reproduction never mentioned this but you need to follow the docs and set the correct variables 
can you change your term query to use  cast title  as the field and see if it works 
why not just use the annotation to suppress that check  eg https   github com elastic elasticsearch blob master src test java org elasticsearch index codec postingformat elasticsearchpostingsformattest java#l36
how would you suggest improving it  want to send a pr 
did you know that you can send a pr with the change by clicking on the small "edit" button just on this page  wanna do contribute it 
would you mind trying again 
do you use the delete by query or bulk apis  are you aware of any issues you had with nodes falling over 
where are the plugins installed  it should check   pwd plugins  or whatever you have specified  path plugins  as in your config 
how you reproduce that 
would using the reindex api be a workaround  gmoskovicz  
can you help me understand the question 
does that sound fair  so  pipelines that did rely on those plugins would still not be present  but the others would still work 
did the uninstall fail because of this 
how are you measuring the number of documents in the index  just  curl localhost 9200 index _count  
can you confirm this fixes the problem  i wonder if we can automatically check for unannotated parameters like in https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 10763  but need to understand guice better first 
can you provide us with the mappings of this message field on all your types  the query would look something like  get    index_name  _mapping field message   https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 1 6 indices get field mapping html
what do you get back as a response to this operation 
what about just setting the  suggest_mode  to  always   see https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current search suggesters term html
could you provide some examples 
what is the mapping of your  facebook  index  do you have the full stack trace from the logs  your workaround simply searches the  _all  field instead of the  _id  field 
can you take a look  drewr 
does this answer you question  out of curiosity   what does it matter to you if the  _default_  mapping is added 
what is the time stamp of the last log entry that has one of those huge exception traces 
what caused the shard failure  then could you also try to provide the info requested here please  https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 12011#issuecomment 122241136 thanks
did you add the  path repo  setting to all data and master nodes and did you restart these nodes after making the change 
what's in the logs 
what version of es are you on  are you using groovy or mvel  inline scripts or file scripts  anything else in the logs 
what were those details 
do you think that this isn't enough 
does openssl document anything about shell characters 
can you please compare the  config log4j2 properties  from your node with the stock reference 
do you have  index shard check_on_startup  set by any chance 
what issues have you experienced 
would you like to work on a pull request 
what is the motivation for this feature request 
does this cover you needs 
can you provide   the full task list    which plugins you have installed  how did you upgrade to 5 4 2  rolling restart or full cluster restart 
can you describe what you are doing 
do you have a custom file  https   github com elastic elasticsearch blob master distribution src main resources config logging yml#l13 l15
could you try out 2 0 0 beta2 and confirm please 
why not just set the date format on your field to  date_optional_time  instead of  strict_date_optional_time  
what version of elasticsearch  my initial guess is that you have a corrupt shard 
which is es version are you using 
why is this in your classpath 
may be you did not reindex your data after applying your mapping changes 
did you run this several times before comparing times  the filter should end up being cached  and fast  
could you open an issue in the apm repo first and we can follow up here if nothing is found on the other side  
did you see this  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch guide current bulk html q bulk
what do you think 
do you have a script that reproduces the issue all the time  or most of the time 
which version are you running 
would you mind if i repurposed this issue to track that 
can you elaborate more on this  it seems strange for a script to have to do this serialization 
do you plan to complete those legacy rhlc api   hub cap
what is the use case 
do you know if you have any recovery settings set on your cluster  https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 15372     this will help here it won't allow all recoveries to come from the same source
may i take up this doc work if it is still open 
what do you think 
can you describe what your test case is doing 
do you want to contribute a doc fix 
can you share information about the size of the cluster and the settings used  especially those affecting shard allocation  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 2 1 index modules allocation html  
can you check if you can query the list of snapshots with  ignore_unavailable  
could you confirm that this recreation is correct 
can you remove the  bigdesk  plugin and retry  seems that this particular plugin is not ready yet for 2 x
maybe you can tell us what prevented you from starting up again 
why  what can be done to improve this situation instead 
can you please add the query that you use  what does the script look like  also  what version of elasticsearch are you using 
could you share what you have in  elasticsearch yml   please replace any secret by  xxxxx    also is that a fresh new installation  how did you create the repository 
what version of elasticsearch are you using 
how is your  createtime  field mapped  i suspect it doesn't work because it got indexed as a string instead of a date 
maybe you could model your documents in such a way that you don't need the source anymore 
did you mean to post this in https   github com elastic kibana  
did you verify it  in any case this is not a scenario that we want to support as it prevents us to enforce any structure of the index 
would response filtering work for this  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current common options html#_response_filtering
what happens if you keep calling this api  does elasticsearch run out of memory 
what version are you running  i'm thinking it could be #14695
did you install the plugin  restart all nodes 
can you reproduce consistently with the java api  if so  can you provide an example snippet in a gist or the like 
how do you initialize your transport client  does it point to the tribe node or to nodes that belong to the two clusters 
can you provide a mapping   set of documents that can reproduce this 
could i suggest migrating to a non raided  locally mounted filesystem and see if the issue disappears 
can we maybe trash it altogether and make it a reasonable interface ie  public indexoutput createoutput    
what's the use case for this 
can you update to a newer jdk 8 version 
can you gives your logs please  what gives  get _cat plugins v  please 
may be you should report your problem at https   github com friendsofsymfony foselasticabundle  
how did you install es 
could you provide a simple recreation  preferably with curl  that demonstrates the problem 
can you provide your mappings please and your settings 
can you double check your rest api output and post any output that may contain the alias name in it rather than the index name 
could you confirm that please  for the record  we have a test which tries settings with 2 zones  https   github com elastic elasticsearch blob 2 1 plugins cloud gce src test java org elasticsearch discovery gce gcediscoverysettingstests java#l72 
can you tell us the exact upgrade procedure you followed and the size of your cluster 
could you please post a complete recreation with exactly the code you are using 
why don't you just check the status periodically  serving read requests is fine only updates are not possible in such a case 
did you set  node client  to  true  or  node master  and  node data  to  false   i believe this may be related to #16565  
can you provide the exact command you ran for updating the aliases on the indices and also show the output of  http   localhost 9200 _aliases  when it was broken 
could you update your description and paste the full stacktrace using 3 ticks       at the beginning and end of the stacktrace  see https   guides github com features mastering markdown   syntax highlighting  
does that help  please note though that elastic reserves github for bug reports and feature requests but provides a  discourse forum  https   discuss elastic co  and  irc channels  https   www elastic co community  for general questions 
what does the scripted update 
could you provide the actual code you use 
can you share your request  including the  filter_path   
maybe i misunderstand  you want the index to be created even if you send an invalid document 
could you also try to explicitly set a region like  "region"  "us west"  
what part of the syntax documentation do you find unclear  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 2 3 query dsl simple query string query html#_simple_query_string_syntax
could you provide the mapping you are sending 
do you have any recommendation 
could you provide a recreation for the issue that you are seeing 
how many client nodes do you have in your cluster  which node do you hit with your rest request 
what log messages do you see  can you take a stack dump with  jstack  when it's apparently hanging 
did you download elasticsearch from the website  https   www elastic co downloads elasticsearch which exact binary did you download  did you just unzip and launch  thanks
why would it increase the probability of conflict 
can you provide an example of what is not in the order you expect and why and preferably what you would it expect to be 
can you provide a list of the current directory structure  with the files  if there is anything else that you think is relevant  given the above explanation   please share 
can you provide a bash script or something like that that reproduces the problem 
do you have any plugins installed 
how different would it be from a date histogram 
do you have specific problem in mind that can you can elaborate on 
can you provide us with the elasticsearch version  list of installed plugins  +version  and the sequence of operations that needs to be performed to trigger this exception 
can you create a pr for this against master 
does your template have mappings for the index 
what version are you running on and what lead to this failure  do you have logs you can provide 
can you also share the explanation of a document that gets ranked higher even though it should be worse 
would you please provide the information that was requested in the issue template  especially the version of elasticsearch 
can you check if you see a stacktrace in the log files  this info doesn't get us anywhere 
would you be able to provide a simple script that reproduces the issue 
can you please indicate the version of ubuntu as well as the output of the command 
did you install with deb  tar  or zip  we test all of those on every build so i'm surprised it isn't working for you 
can you use hostnames and dns resolution  there are some options here  please consider opening a topic on the  elastic discourse forum  https   discuss elastic co  
could you send the output of  get _node stats  during one of these latency spikes 
what about node stats   is there anything happening with memory usage  could you possibly try using netty3      bin elasticsearch  etransport type netty3   and see if this reproduces 
what was the error you got from trying to restore  was it by chance  cannot restore index  your_index_name  because it's open 
would you mind opening a pr for this 
how about make hash method configable 
could you please open an issue there 
can you share your java code please 
would you please try   dhttps proxyhost  and   dhttps proxypost  instead of   dproxyhost  and   dproxyport  
what exactly would the api look like  my concern here is in producing very large responses  esp when you have to combine results from different shards  
do you wanna open a pr for this 
did you receive an error yourself 
do you really intend to generate a bucket for every  50ms   why not using btw a  date_histogram  here 
can you have a look 
maybe you could open a pull request to improve the documentation  reference docs are under  docs reference  in this repo 
could you elaborate a bit more why those don't satisfy your needs 
what does your filters aggregation look like 
why is that 
can you upgrade your java version and see if it fixes your problem 
does this make sense to you 
how many hits are you asking for 
would you please be more specific about the context and what you're expecting 
what led you to discover that selinux is the issue  can you share your mount options for   tmp  
can you try to declare both  elasticsearch  and  reindex client  as dependencies in your project and use  client execute deletebyqueryaction instance  new deletebyqueryrequest searchrequest    instead 
would you be interested in submitting a docs pr for this 
can your heap analysis tool tell us more about what makes these  termquery  objects so large 
what do you suggest that we add to the docs here that would be helpful to users  without going tmi 
what should the expected outcome be  i don't understand what you're trying to do   gradle somerandomtasknamethatdoesnotexist  will give the same error 
did you try with  "endpoint"  "s3 amazonaws com"  instead 
can you upgrade to 2 4 or better to 5 2 and test again  btw you didn't provide the command you ran 
could we support the standard date formats available in es 
what is the error that you see 
what version are you using 
would you mind moving your feature request to the  x pack forum  https   discuss elastic co c x pack  instead  thanks 
does this reliably reproduce  otherwise i think we will chalk this up to a jvm bug  this is an older version of jdk 8 after all 
can somebody in  elastic es search aggs please have a look at this one 
why not wrapping the type queries within a bool query and 2 should clauses  would that work for you 
why do you want term queries to be cached  the term filter in your recreation should execute very quickly without any caching

what version of matplotlib and what backend are you using 
what other possible cases can you think of where the keys cannot be sorted  other than the trivial "object has no  __lt__  and friends" and are not the same object 
can you copy your example to your pr  and then close this  thxs
can you show an incorrect one 
do you need to rebuild your c extensions 
what do you think  cc  jreback
can you show the output of  a columns   i suspect this is due to the order of the labels in the levels  and  sort_index  uses that to sort 
do you have duplicate column names in the dataframe 
can you provide an example  i find this very surprising
could you check those  i won't be able to look for a couple days

can you post a copy pastable example  what is  table  here  what version of pandas are you using  thanks 
can you describe what type of data you actually have  pls show a sample data  
do you have any short  concrete examples of what you're doing  also let us know why using a sparseseries doesn't work for it 
what cython version are you using

what happens if u rename 2nd test 
can you confirm 
maybe you can replace the data with random data  or perhaps narrow it down to a couple of offending lines 
can u provide a small example of how u plan to use the different dtype frames  for testing and possibly to make available as an example
why would you want to do this at all   none  is not a performant sigil for missing values  rather it is  nan   see docs  here  http   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable missing_data html  
can u post the dataframe summary  str df   as well as a sample of the data  df head    
did you recompile after you cloned master  this works for me just fine  on 3 3   on linux
can you give an example  and picture  of the 3 scenarios 
which file 
what does  produce on your box 
what version  can you try with master
did you see the 2nd part of my example  is shape  1 4   which is the result i thin you want  no  what version of pandas are you on 
can u reproduce this from code only and not s pickle 
what exactly is the issue   aside from not being able to use  2 5s  which is already in #8419  its a bug feature 
when you say 'operation fails' what do you mean  this should actually work the way you have it  can you show a traceback 
can you provide a testcase for the docstring issue you mention  that's new 
can you show a sample of your series frame 
what does test_fast sh return 
can't reproduce this on 0 11 0rc1  can you try it out as well 
where does this actually matter 
can you try on 0 11  just released   are you on 32 bit 
would this   does this only work for series  also  how would you handle named match groups   looks like '   name pattern ' 
maybe we should just disallow timedelta's for now  or explicitely save them to sql as ints and raise a warning saying this 
do you have a specific use case for this   get_loc  already accepts a tuple  but that's for partial selection  so this would be somewhat confusing   
what do you suggest we do 
what are you trying to do 
what is the expected output 
what type is it 
can u post the frames that reproduce this   a minimal sample

can you give an example of you want  does  order sort_index  not do what you want 
what version pandas 
how did you install pandas 
how did you generate the file 
which version of python are you using    python   version  
why do you need to serialize the functions  if pandas is on the other machine  that shouldn't be necessary 
can you install numpy in your virtualenv  i can't tell whether it's pandas or numpy install that's causing the error 
why did you close this 
how would you break ties 
why 
what version of pandas 
can you provide a reproducable example

can you show what you would expect as ouptput 
how did you create this store  pls put a complete code example that i can reproduce  with a link to the store 
can you do this with  cumcount  and  size  
can u put up a starting frame as well 
could you post an example input and output  how would this be different from a resample 
can you retry and show the backtrace 
did you try it  it passes thru other keywords thru 
maybe just make them consistent  instead of adding a parameter 
can you show what you are running  do you have rpy installed 
would you be able to test this with the development version 
what do you want to obtain 
shouldn't we just disallow that a series name is unhashable

can you show a usage of this 
can you show an api proposal for your first comment 
what would you have the results be 
what are you trying to do 
why are you using a custom series  version of pandas numpy
what are you trying to do 
did #32425 close this 
do  nans  raise the same  or just  inf  
can you try this on master  i can't reproduce this 
does your actual use case use  select   from test   if so you can do  pd read_sql_table 'test'  engine  chunksize chunksize    which will get the type information from the database   read_sql_query 
does  pd read_fwf       do a credible job with this  w o the columns being specified and hence being inferred  
can you do a pull request 
can you try with current master  and first do a  python make py clean  before  python make py html 
what exactly is the issue 
why are you using a series in your example and not a dataframe  have you tried reset_index    this is exactly tht purpose
does the 'by' issue work   and just is somewhat slower  
what's wrong with connecting with  boto  and then get the data as a string and pass it in a  stringio  object to  read_csv  
how is this a pandas issue  html rendering has not changed in a while you also don't indicate versions as the issue tracker requests
why are you not simply indexing 
what are you trying to do with the range  e g  show the output frame you are expecting
can you have the db dump the actual values  
what are you actually using his for  this is not a supported method  really was just for compat  series is not an ndarray since 0 13
do you want to do a pr for this 
what exactly do you think the bug change is 
how about an option for this  default is turned off   may  float_precision none high   
can you build numpy 
why do you think this should be in pandas rather than  pyspark  
would you mind taking a look at this 
can u show how this was created in the first place  also df info  
what are you actually trying to do 
what are you trying to do  maybe  s s isnull     
what does the dataframe look like    did the data make it in properly  this seems to work for me    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4166648 4783198 6c5404f4 5d1c 11e4 8b18 8519e02b2c36 png 
can you provide a reproducible example   or one that does at least for you sometimes triggers the error  
can you be a little bit more clear  give a small example of the query and the output you get  and what you would expect 
does it segfault if you read in a section of the csv  use the  nrows  argument to  read_csv 
can you show a pseudo example of what you are contemplating 
why are you doing with it 
do you then get a segfault with pyarrow as well  that seems the only difference with the internal pandas implementation and your code 
do you think we should add corresponding   drop_axis  and   fillna_axis   or too much clutter
shouldn't the expected output be 
could you explain why you would want the suffix to be forcefully added  even if duplicates don't exist  i'm having some difficulty understanding the use case 
which pandas version are you using    pd __version__    i get the correct result on 0 15 2 and with master 
what does  engine table_names  return after you try to write it with  to_sql  
would you be interested in doing a pull request for this  should be straightforward
can you clean up your example to make it copy pasteable into a repl so that it's clearer what the problem is 
can you post some example data and the actual  read_csv   and the output you're getting  you can use the stringio module https   docs python org 3 library io html#io stringio to paste the data in  thanks 
can you show a mini example 
can you step thru the 2nd example and show where it cores 
what are u suggesting for a more clear message 
do you have a 32 bit build  this test does seem to depend on a few things  including architecture and the pythonhashseed environment variable 
what does the image look like  here's what i get    figure_1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3195015 5562862 0be23ebe 8e0f 11e4 84d4 d104b54a567d png 
what else would go in  set_meta   and of course  we need to be careful about not modifying the original  self  
can you post a copy pastable example 
can you confirm that setting that to en_us utf 8 fixes the problem 
why would you do this 
what needs to change  what is the probemetic statement  want to do a pull request  pls  pd show_versions   
can you share  pd show_versions     this is quite likely to be dependent on whether you're running python 2 or 3 
can you provide more information  like the actual timings  have you profiled things to see what's slower  perhaps bisect to find what commit slowed things down 
what would your expectation be for the result using the input of  np arange len ts     
what exactly are you proposing  this is a fundamentally non symmetric operation

would you be interested in submitting a pull requests to deprecate  sym_diff  in favor of  symmetric_difference  
can you provide a small reproducible example 
what version of pandas are you using   show  pd __version__   this works for me using pandas 0 15 2
why does this have to do with excel  you are reporting a csv issue  no  excel being able to read something doesn't prove  or disprove  anything 
can you report this at https   github com pydata pandas datareader issues   we are moving this part of pandas over there 
could you give it a shot on a newer version of pandas  all 3 are the same for me  master pandas  matplotlib 1 4 3 
can you try this out   you can just change that one line in the source code 
maybe we should clarify  format  kw is for flexibility rather than performance  i assume not passing  format   and dateutil will be used in most cases  is faster than regex 
could you post images of what you see as well  github let's you  embed them  https   guides github com features mastering markdown   
how does  cstringio stringio self report body   look like 
does ipython notebook cleanly handle horizontal scrolling when necessary if  max width  is removed 
do you have  bottleneck   numexpr  installed  what does the frame look like  in what cases does the error happen  this bug report is lacking much information 
could you provide a reproducible example

maybe we can pass x values as it is 
why would you do this 
can you verify  i don't see a pr that says it was specifically targeting this behavior but appears to already be handled 
can you not just construct the file you need to write to manually with the argument you want 
did u mean to put this in the pandas tracker  this is way out of scope
would you be interested in submitting a pull request for that 
do you know how matpltolib handles similar issues  since apparently an inset doesn't have all the properties of a full  axes  
why don't you give this change a try and see if it breaks anything else  see here for instructions  http   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable contributing html
what's you use here that you're getting object dtypes  integer nans  you'll typically want to avoid object dtypes since they're much slower for numeric operations 
did you updated the example  use  pd util testing assert_almost_equal a values  b values    strangely  assert_frame_equal a  b  check_less_precise true   should work for your data by definition  it raises 
what are you trying to do exactly 
do you have a small script to generate two dataframes that cause the error  that would be preferable to a pickle  also show exactly how you calling  concat  
what version were u on  this is correct a string index is different from s datetimeindex and they don't overlap
can you try with a small test project to see if this builds correctly   see sphinx quickstart  btw  sphinx rtd theme is no dependency for the pandas docs

what are  x  and y 
did you build the extensions  works on an identical machine 
can you show the output of 
what is  dg load_path  exactly  there is slightly different filepath processing with the 2 functions  fyi this has been somewhat improved in 0 17 0   so pls give a try there as well
does that mean that something has to be changed in the process during operations between two series

could you double check  if it also works for you  then i would suggest to close  thanks 
do you want to pr for an extended message 
can you try that and see if this does work using an sqlalchemy engine 
can you recast your example to something that has a group  and another where the group is missing  
why would you actually want to do this 
what exactly is the issue 
would you have a look and see what changed and or provide a pr to fix   keeping in mind that we are back compat thru scipy 0 13 
does your csv file look just like this 
why are you trying to do this  for example concatting an empty frame with one that is correctly dtypes will work  so this doesn't practically make a difference 
how do you _know_ that this should not align 
do you have any way to simplify this example  fwiw you could just sum your boolean columns to get the same result
can you post the full traceback 
can you tell us which version it this last worked  cc  jreback  mroeschke

can you open the file using xlrd   openpyxl directly and see how they read it  that would isolate the problem a bit 
what exactly is the problem  show the full   pd show_versions     as well 
can you post a copy pastable example  your code isn't runnable since  data  isn't defined 
does that work for you 
did you mean to close  if it isn't working for you  please reopen  could be combination of python version os

can you provide a data set that reproduces the issue  either something existing online  or you can attach to the issue 
can you paste the output of  df columns   and try on a newer version of pandas  i suspect this was fixed in https   github com pandas dev pandas issues 13885
could you post the full traceback  including your input   and double check your versions  hard to say for sure  but i think you're referencing https   github com pandas dev pandas blob 473615e4e0e7f01410a0a2cc8ded10af5d393957 pandas core missing py#l40  which is correct
can you provide a reproducible example that illustrates the problem   see eg http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports

what are you going to do with that 
do you see any instances where api exposed objects are being namespaced with pandas instead of pd  those may be worth updating 
what exactly is not right here  can you show a result  and expected  that you think should be the case here  ideally write a test that should pass
why not just have last   reference nth  1  
can you go go a few commits back and see where the problem started   like git bisect

does this apply to a specific browser  i failed to reproduce this in chrome  firefox  ie8 and ie9  a screenshot and perhaps also the svg file would be helpful

can you reproduce with the given demo  you say "when _clicking_ the name   " but you mean _touching_  right 
what values do you get  i get 14 14065 in chrome and 15 in firefox  a workaround may be to use another font  like arial  that perhaps behaves more consistently 
did you try  crop  false  _and_  overflow 'none'   
does this still happen with the new release  1 3 8  i don't see any problem with your fiddle today 
how exactly does it resolve the issue 
does the advice there help 
can you set up a live demo 
can we do this in the same way we did with multipane plot lines grid lines crosshairs 
what is customevents js 
could this be similar to #2522  
do you mean that linewidth is not applied correctly  
do you mean  that highstock should render stacked areas in a different way than highcharts  compare  http   jsfiddle net d54zdmr4 3 
can you elaborate this  the axes are moving a bit because there are no labels to show  since there is no data on the axis   is that what you mean 
maybe a ´column´chart is more what you are looking for  
does the  adapttoupdateddata  http   api highcharts com highstock#navigator adapttoupdateddata  setting do any difference 
can you reproduce it reliably if you set a fixed width on the chart 
will this work for you   meineckej  
can you give us more details to reproduce it 
can you verify that that fix also fixes your issue 
what version are you on  how many iterations do you run before it snaps 
may it be connected to #3935 
do you consider this a bug  how would you expect it to work 
could you setup jsfiddle demo  do you encounter the same issue on our demo  http   www highcharts com stock demo dynamic update  
could you setup jsfiddle demo with that issue 
can you reproduce a case where it fails 
would the solution like  overflow  "justify"  for datalabels work for you 
can you provide a demo  i set up a  test case  http   jsfiddle net highcharts xq29x6ja    but even when running 10 000 points the numbers are preserved in the original array 
could you create an example  simple test case  http   jsfiddle net pm917cko 
did you find the url above somewhere on our website 
how does this work for you  http   jsfiddle net highcharts gh8g2zu9 2 
when above  don't create points for a hidden series  but create in any other case 
can you help us reproduce that  here's my try  http   jsfiddle net highcharts x75ft843 
could you setup jsfiddle with this issue  just tested and works fine  see  http   jsfiddle net rfcvugrw 
should we use some specific browser to see that issue  tested with latest chrome and works fine  see    click_on_flag  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1453926 10573159 2c2343a8 764e 11e5 9225 7cfbf369c9b4 gif  regarding  webkitmovementx  see #4568
can you set the explicit width of the chart to reproduce the issue 
can you share a live reproduction with us  i tried here  but maybe you can change it to display the bug  http   jsfiddle net highcharts 5znp55oa 
should be fixed on the bugfix branch  could you confirm  see  http   jsfiddle net a129eret 8 
how does this work for you  i added a custom event   selectedpoints   that you can use instead of single point events 
could you setup live dime  for example jsfiddle  we will check this 
how about using simple  setdata    instead of updating each point  one by one  see  http   jsfiddle net 25ajh3tt 4 
could you post the right one  or update my use case  http   jsfiddle net e3ly3wcw    thanks 
does it help if you  disable animation  http   jsfiddle net highcharts kt0ayh4g 4    can you show us a sketch of what it looks like after the failure 
could you set up a quick jsfiddle for testing 
could you setup jsfiddle demo  or is it the same issue as in #4818  webpack issue   
could you post live example  like jsfiddle  how to recreate the problem 
could you reproduce this issue in a jsfiddle demo 
can you eliminate the html form so that your demo shows only the highcharts api  otherwise this question belongs more to tech support than to the issue tracker 
can you verify that this now works on windows ie  use  this fiddle  http   jsfiddle net highcharts zqh4jyff 4   to test 
could you try our master branch  it should be already fixed   http   github highcharts com highcharts src js 
could you provide us with a live example of what you are describing  it would be much appreciated   jsfiddle  https   jsfiddle net   works great for this purpose 
could you update this jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net zp775qfv 4  to reproduce issue

can you show us a live jsfiddle demo please 
can you modify  this demo  http   jsfiddle net highcharts qaps4y9g   in order to show the bug 
did you forget to add the steps to reproduce  in  this basic demo  http   jsfiddle net highcharts gvehsjvm   the title doesn't overlap the plot area  can you modify the demo to demonstrate your issue 
what are the practical implications of this  you you see the tooltip in any browser  it has  display  none  so it should be hidden away 
which character set specifically is used 
can you set a fixed width that reliably reproduces the problem 
do you mean you want multiple tooltips  popups  visible at the same time  one pointing at each point  maybe you can use the experimental  tooltip split  https   jsfiddle net gyw0ydx2 4   plugin 
can you do any modifications to this to demonstrate the problem 
could you recreate issue on jsfiddle  we will check this 
could you create an example for that case  if you want to see  which points actually are in the series  use  series options data   not  series data   https   jsfiddle net wya237o7 2 
how about using  addpoint    instead of  setdata      like this  http   jsfiddle net blacklabel vmw9xgbe 4 
which is calculated automatically by default 
how about setting   cropthreshold   http   api highcharts com highcharts plotoptions series cropthreshold    for example  http   jsfiddle net bpqpy0ko 4 
does that match what you see 
could you please share the solution  thanks
could you update jsfiddle with your code 
would you be able to isolate the code that sets the font properties  or try loading other fonts 
could you try testing with the drop in fix mentioned in that issue 
could you provide chart's config so we can debug this  thanks  my lucky guess is related to  usehtml true  and not setting   exporting allowhtml   https   api highcharts com highcharts exporting allowhtml  to true 
should we set textoverflow to ellipsis by default  or is this by design for some reason 
can you provide a live demo please

can you test your setup with this commit  you can load http   github highcharts com 62003e644 js highcharts src js  
can you create a jsfiddle 
may i ask how a chart with 600 line series is used

however  could explain the purpose of using  chart destroy    right after chart was created 
could you provide us with a gif presenting described behaviour  tested on ie11 and chrome 61 0 3163 100  windows 8 1 x64 
could you try    set   series datalabels allowoverlap   http   api highcharts com highcharts plotoptions series datalabels allowoverlap  to true   or    set   series datalabels padding   http   api highcharts com highcharts plotoptions series datalabels padding  to 0

do you have an example of a chart that is drawn multiple times 
could you update my demo with your code for the further debugging

do you see this in our official demos  i went to http   www highcharts com stock demo basic line and it works fine for me  tested with chrome 56 windows 10 and chrome 56 mac 
could you simplify your chart and update my code with yours to introduce the problem  it will allow us to debug and find a reason 
maybe you have our email in spam 
maybe we should consider add showinlegend option also for pie   funnel etc  
why would you expect different behaviour  to me that is counterintuitive  the ultimate goal should be that the svg pseudo html behaves identical to true html 
when having 3 time changes there are two missing labels   demo  http   jsfiddle net r2m15m6d  have you tried using moment js to get proper time for a required time zone  api reference  http   api highcharts com highstock global gettimezoneoffset

do you have something in mind  rainerschwarze   at this moment each  point  has info if label was justified   point islabeljustified

can i work on this  also  can you suggest how should i approach this problem 
should is be configurable   moorepants
why was i cc'd on this  
can you post the code here on the issue  or on a gist if it's too large 
would you like to help  grab the source from git  try to put a complex conjugate in  then run the test suite and see if any tests fail   
can you explain in more detail what the problem is  calling  float    on a float object works for me 
maybe  idx  could be extended with an optional parameter to tell if the indices should be contracted  i would support adding  sum  objects whenever there is a contraction 
can i work on this issue 
did you compute successfully with polynomials in 1 0 using numbers like this   1360 393798360780044856477018417517128258181825797801822663234852702317479530758694403277270999911851 + 3 028755129743630048165040820491299486932384987680791282508318794359722116240588864740850378330409428e 98j

why do you state that it doesn't work  the parenthesis you refer to is in the right place 
can you please post a copy of the sketch you're compiling  are you absolutely certain you installed the irremote library in a location arduino can access 
could you try again with verbose compilation enabled  and post the full output  from the bottom window  and your full sketch code 
could it b e that there is an old version of the spi library somewhere in your sketchbook  if not  could your post the full verbose compilation output here 
which firmware are you running on the yún  which operating system do you use 
could you post a minimal sketch that sends those 5 characters  i'll see if i can use that to reproduce the bad timing here 
what ide version are you using  could you try the latest hourly  could you add   verbose to see what compiler commands are being used 
can you perhaps post the full sketch that causes this  after removing everything that is not needed to show the problem  
maybe some sort of additional message for this case where no bootloader is responding could at least direct people to a better path to troubleshoot the problem 
can you please add some more detail  what's wrong with the errors  color  size  antialias   cc  00alis

can you give it a try and report if your issue is still valid 
why dont you switch to the 16u2 usb port 
what variant  board  are you using 
however  i'm not so sure how to edit the side bar on the playground  perhaps it's a page with a special name

can you provide a small test case  which board are you using 
can you provide a test sketch 
did installing the library solve the issue 
did you realize el capitan has been released 3 months and a half after 1 6 5

how is user supposed to choose which library version to use 
what changes do you need in arduino builder for this  to allow modified but not saved library files to be included in the build 
why 
maybe you should add this to the  zip files by default or as setting  thats sounds like a cool feature on school pcs which are mostly windows and blocked 
which version of the ide are you using 
which version of the ide are you using

which programmer did you have selected  tedder  which board did you have selected 
did u changed the database credentials  sequelize seems currently not support an empty password 
could you take a look at the latest version in the repository and tell me if it now works the way it should 
what do you think 
what version are u using 
do you have a logfile   did you get something like "possible eventemitter memory leak detected"  
does that help 
can u try that 
how do you dynamically change the attributes  in general  methods work on the definition   not on what's actually defined in the database 
what    
what is the advantage of the lib  i was thinking about switching to node db mysql
what else option do u want 
would u mind posting your code  
how did you create the tables 
did u find a solution 
could you try with the lastest version directly from the repo 
what does your model definition look like  default values add a small amount of overhead
can you test this against master  i believe i fixed a similar bug yesterday 
can you be more explicit  when does this happen  the id shouldn't even be in there  i never saw this happening on my system 
did you notice that the format of migrations have changed in 1 6 0  
does it work if you use  models ink create          
could you try checking what version of sequelize you have installed   npm list sequelize    and maybe running my test code if everything still looks weird 
which version of sequelize do you use 
what has happened  why is the pr closed 
does someone else know of a better way though  the way i proposed could get very messy 
what does your migration code look like  i recall earlier issues about this  we might not fully support it yet 
does your database support nan as a value in any way  my guess is you'd want to insert a null instead
could you post your model definitions 
do you try the plugin when use the database pool  base on current sequelize code  i'm afraid your code may have issue in that case 
what version are you seeing this on 
what version and dialect are you experiencing this on 
whats the expected behaviour here  you are not providing a value for size  and the column does not have a default value   so what should we insert instead 
can we see your model definitions + sequelize options please      just don't forget to omit the db credentials 
did you  npm install pg   
what version of sequelize are you using  i think this is only present in v1 7 0 alpha2 and later versions 
what are you trying to achieve 
does it support pooling   
could you please move this issue to the sequelize sequelize doc repo     
should we hide the dottie parsing behind a flag   c f  https   github com sequelize sequelize issues 1837 
can you check if it works for you on the 2 0 0 branch  if it does i'll do a new release 
what dialect are you using  i believe postgres supports uuid's natively so it should happen automatically when the column is created 
do you get any errors  what version of sequelize are you running  what's the output if you console log datatypes string 128    it should work  according to the docs   
could you please post your models and some sample code 
could you show the code +model definitions that are triggering this error 
could you please move the issue to https   github com sequelize sequelize doc  
what kind of support are you looking for in terms of using xml with postgres 
whats the generated sql query  else you can do 
can anyone help me out   +1
may i ask why you want the sql without executing the query 
what are you expecting to happen exactly  and what's happening 
could you please try testing it against master aswell 
what's the generated query for your bulkcreate call  i changed some logic so postgres would use default for ai attributes  but that shouldn't overwrite existing values 
what exactly do you need this for  are you generating a lot of dynamic models and therefor want to release the memory 
could you provide a test case for that     which version are you experiencing this on 
what version are you testing this against 
could you give an example of the api 
does it work if you set it to seconds  however i believe it's supposed to be ms  i have however never seen your error before 
can you clarify  "multiple instances" would just be array of instances  so usually regular array mapping techniques work 
what are version are you using  eshell  
where a model can emit an event that another model can react on without knowing about the original model 
could you move the join table specific where's to  include where  and see how you do 
how would you do it with anything     i usually just pass the user performing the action to the method  but i suppose you could use something like https   github com othiym23 node continuation local storage 
can you show me a test case 
can you try logging transaction datavalues  i'm thinking this might be related to #1465   does it work for you in 2 0 0 dev4 or dev5 
what does the sql look like 
could you please provide some table + association definitions 
does wrapping the   or    in an   and    work 
could you provide some sample code + your version 
what would a query look like both inserting and querying on lat lng 
what version are you using 
does  distinct  work as a function  but yeah it looks right  alekbarszczewski a pr with a test would be awesome    
what version  this should definitely work on a stable version but i see how it'd might break in the latest master perhaps  any ideas  janmeier 
can you show create table sql statement  a pr with a failing unit test is as always welcome 
can you try using  user createitem  'item'  '4321'    rather than build add  build add should work for this type of association though  what does the sql queries look like for the calls 
can you post your code  this sounds interesting 
can you connect to your mysql server from the command line 
what happens 
which version 
when you include 
could you provide a self contained test case 
what methods are you currently using that don't support schemas  i know that  addcolumn  and  changecolumn  are likely lacking in schema support 
could you try to clean up the formatting of your issue or provide a small reproduceable case  the code looks right but it's honestly hard to tell 
what dialect  it's likely a dialect connector issue rather than a sequelize issue  postgres returns them as strings because of a large number issue in javascript afair 
what version of sequelize are you using 
what does the sql look like currently  what does the sql look like without quoted fields  what does the sql look like without fields defined at all 
what does your userrole definition look like  you should just be able to change the name to 'user_role'   sequelize define 'user_role'  
what version are you on  also  could you please provide your model definition + associations
does it work if you try to load the user directly  without eager loading  with that query  does it work if you remove req query 
what version did you encounter this one  did you try out against master  think we actually handle cases where associations are named the same as columns now  right  janmeier 
how does disposer and using work 
what do you want to limit   the number of students or the number of courses 
how many times is the console log executed 
can you show the entire sql log please   including the create table statements  
what version are you using  async validations  validations with a callback  only work on 2 0
what code are you calling to trigger this error 
how are you doing underscored  perhaps that function returns null if there is no camel casing in the word  please provide a more specific test case
what does the create table statements look like  are the constraints actually created  what version are you on 
how are you running the query exactly  we don't support responses for all type of raw queries unfortuneatly 
what dialect are you using 
which version  model definition  what code  raw query or bulk create    please read the contribution guidelines     
what version are you using    save    should not be updating unchanged fields anymore by default  in any case  save  does support a  fields  option that you could use 
what version are you using 
what does the array look like  it seems like it might have an non empty but undefined field 
what version are you using  appears to work perfectly on 2 0 0 
what version of sequelize  looks like the error is that the join is not using your schema 
what version  i don't believe this to be the case on the latest version 
can you try showing the sql outputted for the update 
can you provide a test case 
how do your user model look  have you correctly marked user_id as the primary autoincrement key 
does the executed sql look right 
how about  sequelize utils todefaultvalue sequelize uuidv4     
does your work build on the support for ms sql already in sequelize or is it completely new 
could you provide a concrete example 
which version of sequelize are you using 
which version are you experiencing this on  i did some changes to how upsert gets its values pretty recently
what kind of unexpected results  which version are you on 
what does the sql look like for the call  are you using  field  for any of your attributes 
how will it not run 
where are you seeing the error  on queries or "randomly" 
how are you updating your instance values right now 
what line exactly is the error from 
what are you doing that you get so many numbers as strings  not sure i like this change  javascript type coercion can have surprising behaviours sometimes 
what version is this 
what are the different relationship types  you might want to name them with alias  is the one actions on a user and the other one actions performed by a user 
can you show a more concrete example  ideally a self contained test case that shows the issues have you seen https   github com sequelize sequelize issues 4335  the instance will not be saved if nothing has changed
can you post both your models in full + the relations where the sync will fail 
what version are you using and have you attempted on the latest version master 
maybe a case of leave it as it but clarify in the docs 
do you have a   catch  handler 
can you verify that  updatedat  is not getting set with   set values   raw  true    by checking the return with   get    or is just not being saved 
can you show a small example 
could you please provide the actual error that happens    console log err   
whats your specifc usecase for  cancel  here  
can you show your actual code 
can you please post a complete example  models  and code to represent the issue
can you try logging  query where  
can you show the through model aswell  are you using  force  true  with sync 
which dialect is this on  can you create a self contained example that i can run 
would this not be more clear 
what does the failing query look like 
can you show the actual query you're running  for postgres you might need to use returning id  to get the id 
could you post the model definitions and associations for the models in question 
what do you mean  you can add multiple replacements by adding more parameters to the query if thats wht you mean 
what do you mean  if you need to rollback a managed transaction  you can just return a rejected promise
what you're doing should work though  is the sequelize sql log outputting anything 
what version are you using 
does it happen it you call  find  twice in succesion  can you create a small  reproducable test case 
does adding distinct to the query fix it for you 
do you have a test case for me  the unique validation i used does not escape the path on any dialect   
what version are you using  we recently fixed some bugs with otherkey inferring and 2 x belongstomany 
can you add a  console log err   statement in the catch here https   github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib dialects postgres connection manager js#l16 to see what happens 
can you try without promise method and use promise try directly  does it work if you cut out promise method try completely   would like to know if this is a sequelize or bluebird issue 
can you show your model definition  the actual removecolumn call and the sql log 
can you try logging  happening instance prototype  
what version are you using  this was fixed recently 
what's your usecase 
what version are you using  does it work with  findall  
should be fixed by https   github com sequelize sequelize pull 3694 what version are you running 
what does your  where  object look like  from the query you want it looks like you should place the where objct only on the main query  not on the includes
what does your bulkcreate call lok like and what version are you on  a bug with bulkcreate and  field  was recently fixed 
what version of sequelize 
can you post a full example that shows your issue 
what version do you use  this should have been  fixed  https   github com sequelize sequelize commit 04f1e1f01f0196fc3fba6d7ec636ded6c7fc7d6b#diff 6eed5d5a54bdcfa65b0d7f6557362965 
what are you referring to exactly  https   github com sequelize express example  if so please open an issue there  sequelize doesn't do auto loading on it's own 
what version are you using  can try logging  order belongstomany  and  object keys order   
where else would you store the password  in my experience storing it in a config file  which of course is not kept in source control  is a pretty common practice
what version are you running  should be fixed in 2 1 2
would you be so kind and show your company model too 
which version are you on 
how exactly does updating assigneeid not work  does the query error  is the value not saved  what does the executed sql look like 
which version are you on 
can you show some example code please 
what y'all think 
can you show model definitions and assoications 
should it have all tags  you should be able to  include attributes       to prevent the data being returned
does  does this throw an error as well 
does it work if yhou remove  quoteidentifiers  false  
can you post model definitions and associations as well 
what is at  users js 44 12   you are trying to call something that is undefined at that line  char
can you output the sql log for the sync statement by adding  logging  console log  
can you show an  sscce  http   sscce org   
which dialect and version are you on  as far as i remember all dialects should check for this model before checking unique keys
can you manually require sqlite3 
maybe even a suggestion for the api     
can you point to a place where this is the case  pretty sure i did a search replace after jan pointed out my mistake 
do you agree that we should make an exception and let scopes supply default values here  mickhansen  
what's not working with the example you have there 
which version are you using 
can you try to see if the transaction is pased properly when it fails 
does it work when you camelcase  autoincrement  as  autoincrement   assuming the definition is a c p that's likely your issue 
what bundling applications  we are swamped right now  so if you want this quick creating a pull request is the way to go
what type is set for the field 
do you think it should 
what release did it work on previously   that code is pretty old afair 
does it work  findall  rather than  findandcount   the  limit  is the culprit here since it triggers subquery logic 
did you try placing the  order  on the include  since you are ordering the included and not the parent rows 
how many instances of your app are you running  are you restarting the app often   are you gracefully exiting   what's the timeout on the server 
does the table actually exist  have you called sync  or is he table already created 
why are you using the   table field   in this example  the regular  include where  should solve this case 
can you please post the relevant error 
what's not working exactly 
what type of query are you executing  if you have a lot of joins that will increase the parse time for sequelize 
can you show an example of this  validations are run before hitting the database and before the sql is generated  so we can't really return the sql there 
what output does  object keys user instance prototype   give you 
can you show the call you are doing 
can you verify whether or not the lambda process actually closes  could be the server keeping it alive 
which version 
do you have a  api_name  attribute on your orgapireveisionversion 
what does the sql query look like 
can you post the sql generated by the sync call 
can you show me the correct sql for that query 
what's the issue here exactly  that sqlite does not support  default null  or that it's not parsed correctly on schema changes 
does the same happen with other versions  3 x  4 0 0 0  4 0 0 2  
how are the results coming back if you run the query manually  sequelize collects the nested results  but does not do any ordering

which version you are using   have you tried the latest  master  branch  
can you create an  sscce  http   sscce org    its impossible for us to debug the problem if we can't replicate it
can you post the code you have as a  sscce  http   sscce org     self contained test case 
does the happen when the attribute is on a model  and calling  sync   or does it happen when altering a table through the query interface   or both

can you please post a jsfiddle with a simple app that is affected by this issue 
could you post an example of code that you are doing

what was your expectation  i only see ng repeat in there and it seems the proper output after compiling 
can you provide a test that shows this  not  happening 
can you please create a simple example on plnkr co

could you elaborate more on the use case 
does not sound right    do you have more usecases for this 
can you please share your solution  can't find this anywhere 
can you possibly try setting the  1 ms value to  0  with your code and see if that changes anything 
can you check if this solves your problem 
could you try and confirm 
does #5570 take care of this issue 
could you please provide more details about your provider and the test you are trying to write  ideally in a plunker or similar  thnx 
can this be triaged 
would it be sufficient if  parse took an optional argument that would tell it to not unwrap promises 
couldn't you do  ng attr "'4'"   pass it as a string  it's the same as  ng include "'mytemplate html'"   it might not be the best solution for your situation  but it is possbile 
does this persist when you use array annotation for di

what it would be useful for 
what is your real problem here  i mean  why the current behavior of   compile  troubling you 
could you  for completeness  change your base tag to   base   if it still doesn't work this issue is identical to mine 
do you have a plunkr link 
can you make a demo 
what's your use case 
would that help you 
what about using real jquery 
what can we do to get a fix merged  since he closed his 
does that help 
can you create a unit test that would demonstrate this bug when using jquery 
can you make a demo  i tried to call both  history pushstate    and  history replacestate    with angular loaded and nothing happened  you are probably using routing right

why was this issue closed  i suffer from the same problem  and had to comment out line 2122 in order to see originating error  or use console log e   
can you provide the url to this section that is broken 
does it work correctly on rc1  what about latest snapshot  http   code angularjs org snapshot angular js 
would you be able to investigate this a bit and see if you can pinpoint the cause of the issue 
would this be related to https   github com angular angular js pull 4119 
can you check with http   code angularjs org snapshot angular js   also did this ever work  i e  is it a regression 
how about  promise 'catch'  errorcallback    
can you recreate the example using  plunker  plnkr co   or  jsfiddle  jsfiddle net   also  can you check against  1 2 0 rc 2  
why didn't this get implemented by the browser core  maybe because it's a beast that doesn't fit the real world    
can you give a more complete example  i've a hard time figuring out the use case 
why not just 
can you provide steps to reproduce the issue please 
does this answer your question  because this isn't actionable  i'm going to close it  i don't think it makes sense for angular core to implement such a module for 1 3 
can you explain why this is dangerous 
can you try with an unminified script and post your backtrace  it's entirely possible that this could be improved  but minified scripts don't produce the best error logs 
what makes you feel uncomfortable about the second approach  personally i really do find it more readable as it is pretty clear what is going on 
can you provide a plunkr please  i responded to an issue earlier today which may be related to this

can we close this then 
can you elaborate 
does this cause you any trouble  the only part where it should matter is testing

did we ever mark that as a breaking change  i know someone asked for it to be documented in the changelog
what are you doing with the meta data when you only would like to have the items in the resource 
maybe this has something to do with the way that ngrepeat places comments around the html element

can you please show an example of this  you mean  if a user blurs a disabled field   touched is set to true 
does it only happen in mac chrome  if yes  it's probably a browser bug 
shouldn't you set it to true somewhere  like in

can you please try with 1 4 4 
can you please make it work 
why do you minify your tests 
where exactly on  angular io  https   angular io  where you directed to this repo    i'm asking  because it might be a _bug_ in  angular io  https   angular io  that needs fixing  
maybe something is wrong with your environment  a git command seems to have failed 
do you plan to make the state classed customizable  because i'd like my classes to reflect the element's state  rather than the promise state 
what are you observing in your plnkr and what how is it different from the expected behaviour   afaict  it works as expected 
maybe some other watch causes the infdig digest  and that's why you are getting the same output for this specific object 
how is this different better than using the   rootscope    if you want a function  it is super easy to create one as well 
what version of angular are you using 
can you please post a demo via plnkr co or similar that shows the problem

can you please create a plunker with the example above 
what kind of templates are we talking about  directive templates  ng includes  route templates 
would you like to open a pr 
maybe you can open an issue at mozilla about this 
can you please post a demo that shows the problem  otherwise it's very hard to say 
do i understand correctly that the issue only presents itself o ie11   what other versions browsers have you tried this on

can you confirm what version of angular you are using and whether the file is available on your server 
maybe you were thinking about  angularjs org  https   github com angular angularjs org   which is separate repo     but even there  there's no "content" in the tranditional sense of the term  imo  
why is this a problem  when you reload the page  everything gets reloaded  so any errors shouldn't have any consequences

do you expect the result to be one class per sample 
can you paste here a minimal dataset that reproduces the problem  the reason it starts at 1 is for allowing a dummy feature at 0  to replace the bias

do you think you could send us a pull request with a patch  alex
does this problem appear also with the stable version   did the compilation finish without problems  
can you send a pr 
how did you install scikit learn 
do you have a simple example of roc_curve producing  fpr tpr  pairs that do not start at 0  it would be helpful for me to fix the problem 
should we ping you explicitly in the future so you can run the rc  it looks like we will do 0 18 1 in either case  so we can fix this 
how did you build test  yarikoptic 
maybe  nicolashug remembers something about this 
what is the numpy version on aws 
which version of scikit learn are you using  git clone or released version   on which platform  what is the error message 
how big is your dataset 
what do you mean by "the details covered in the explanation is tautological"  thanks for your criticism and input  cheers  andy
can you do "nosetest sklearn" in the scikit learn directory and see if this works 
do you mean in the example script on the webpage 
would you consider sending us a pull request that fix the pb  it should include a non regression test 
could you try again with current master  i tried to fix the random seed 
did  erg mention random failure 
what version of cython do you have  i suspect that it is not recent enough 
what numpy blas version are your running  thx  peter
maybe  briancheung could have a look at the test code  i just generate an indicator matrix and add some gaussian noise then use  discretization  to get the true label 
what happens if you "make test" or do the ipython version from any other folder  cheers  andy
can you try py27 sklearn instead  maybe they upgraded it 
maybe you can give it a try and send us a pull request  see the guide how to contribute  http   scikit learn org stable developers index html#contributing code

do you know where this could come from

would it solve the problem on your box  thanks for reporting
could you please tell me which version of numpy you have installed  cheers  andy
which version are you using  i'll try to have a look later 
would it make sense to do the stacking sparse or with np depending on  issparse x   
can you monitor memory usage  this might be the same as https   github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 1734
which page are you talking about  we use ga for tracking the traffic on the website of the project so the js is intended

which version did you use 
what was the purpose of the collapsible sidebar again 
maybe we can work on my website mock up at the sprint  there are several issues with the current design   
which doc specifically are you thinking about changing 
why would failing to introspect lead to a "skip"  the skip needs to be done explicitly  right 
could it be that this is the same issue as #1406 
what kind of example did you have in mind  one that shows the simple use case with a single doc 
which versions of scipy and numpy do you have  i assume you have scikit learn 0 13 
why did you close the issue 
can you give me your nose version 
how did you install numpy and scikit learn on your system 
what now  close as won't fix  there's very little we can do at this point except pester the numpy maintainers about it 
what do you want to achieve 
can you reproduce the issue with a numpy scipy built against mkl  canopy for example   there are known multiprocessing issues with system blas lapack on mac os x 
did you do anything funny to your numpy 
can you give a small example 
maybe  mblondel  
do you want to attempt the second or the first  also  mfeurer is probably interested in this 
do somewhat  not everything will work  but core features should work  also  you should use the development version to have good python 3 support 
which version are you using  current master 
which version is this  could you please try with  n_jobs 1  
what is the shape of followers  and what arguments did you give to minmaxscaler   can you reproduce with random data

do you mind adding that to your pr   ccoovrey   regards
can you provide a gist that reproduces the problem 
can you check that you still get that error with the master branch 
do you expect the similarity matrix to have a lot of zeros  if not it makes a lot more sense to store it as a dense array  my 2c
maybe we can consolidate answers to this and add it to the faq and link to the model exporters 
do you have a tiny example script that demoes the problem and can be used as a non regression test 
what were you trying to do  i e  which command is this 
which version do you have installed  current master  also which scipy and numpy do you have 
what version of scikit learn are you using 
do you mind sharing your data x with me 
can you try passing a 2d array for x  your x is of shape  3  
why are the options of  pd fillna  and  simpleimputer strategy 'constant'   and  hashingvectorizer preprocessor   blah  insufficient 
how is this different from what you envisioned 
what is printed on the console when you do  make in   does it fail

what's the difference between your expected and actual results 
why do you want to use this outer for loop 
can you say what your motivation is  why don't you just use linearsvc  you can definitely re implement predict_proba  but the easiest thing would be to use  calibratedclassifiercv  instead 
shouldn't be too hard to do  but why would you store a list of strings in a pandas structure in the first place 
how about in the makefile in docs 
does the error persist if you use sklearn naive_bayes gaussiannb 
can you try with the new thread backend from current master

can you show us the output of   
do you see any cpu usage  if one of the jobs segfaults the pool will hang and not show any cpu usage 
which density computation are you referring to  and which scipy implementation are you talking about  there is no gmm in scipy  right 
would to care to try and fix it some other way    make doc noplot  to build the docs quickly  
maybe we can avoid this usecase    
why do you want that  alpha 1 is pretty rare  but i don't see why it shouldn't be allowed 
what does  say 
could it be that the underlying blas implementation uses multiple threads  afaik  lasso  implements coordinate descent w o using blas routines but i might be wrong there 
can you explain the setting in which you run into problems 
what is max_samples_leaf  should
can you give us a sense of the broader problem context  why are you attempting to use a  labelencoder  in a pipeline 
can you import numpy and or scipy without this issue occurring 
do you mean l1+l2 aka elastic net  if so it is implemented with coordinate descent and sgd

what makes you think it's a bug 
what would be the difference between warm_start and partial_fit 
which version of the docs do you look at 
did you run into any issues  we could just change it  but having a regression test would be a nice motivation 
which algorithm is this for 
does it work outside of the jupyter docker environment 
can you provide their versions  too  pil version can be obtained in python as
can you provide an example

how did you install 
can you deterministically reproduce that behavior 
can you give the full traceback please  also  which version of scikit learn are you trying to install and how 
could you also comment on #4223 
did you get this behavior consistently for the two versions  that seems a bit odd  also  i recommend you upgrade to 0 16 1
which version of scikit learn is that  can you try 0 16 1 
do you have a stand alone snippet reproducing the problem  that would make it a lot easier for people to investigate 
how would you do that  binning  and do you have a reference

can you give a synthetic dataset   sniplet where this is a problem 
where did you see performance degradation  we might consider adding a conversion in the algorithm for efficiency 
does setting the  base_estimator  in the grid search work  it should  right 
can you open a pull request with this change  note that the first part was already solved in #8591  but not the second
can you provide the full tracack  i don't see the line where the error occured  also  can you post your code  it doesn't look like the error is in  load_iris

can you try increasing  residual_threshold  
maybe a good reason to add sbs http   rasbt github io mlxtend docs feature_selection sequential_backward_selection   
shall i add the example in  examples calibration   
do you have any preferences in this matter   giorgiop 
which version of scikit learn are you using  what is your operating system  and can you try again with a fixed random_state 
what are your versions of numpy  scipy and scikit learn  i can't reproduce with scikit learn master and numpy '1 9 3' and scipy '0 15 1'
why do we need to do anything  you already opened the issue  right  but scikit learn is not the name of the precise apt package  it's  python sklearn  
can you give an example of data  together with the wrong output and the expected output 
do you want to fix this in a pr  
would you make that sparse too 
which version of scikit learn are you using  i think this should be fixed in master  it seems odd that you get an error  though  how did you install 
maybe there is something wrong in the newer version of numpy 
maybe add a section in the user guide  we could just add a doctest that does   
do you just want a util that splits data into chunks  runs predict through joblib parallel then stacks the results 
can you give a reference of a paper using this in a machine learning application  also  have you checked our inclusion criteria in the faq  http   scikit learn org dev faq html#can i add this new algorithm that i or someone else just published
can you reproduce with a subset of your data then share  it could be a numerical instability issue
how are you doing the import  try something like 
could you put together a standalone example  so that we can try to reproduce the problem  
which os are you using 
can i work on this issue 
why is that an issue  you run out of memory    try using fewer processes
did you try  init 'random'   that should make a big difference 
maybe you refer to that  
could you try upgrading re installing your numpy   also refer    this so answer  http   stackoverflow com a 18369312 3109769  
what do you mean by "good integration" 
what kind of metric are you using for clustering 
maybe your problem stems from the fact that you are giving your complete data to "partial_fit" 
do you mind sharing your matlab's results for the iris dataset  a gist would be great  thanks 
can you share a benchmark  
can you try casting your input to float64 
how much is "really slow"  it should be 1 5 times slower  i guess  also the docstring is not very helpful  i think 
could you try to provide a snippet that reproduces the problem 
which method are you using  ball tree or brute 
shouldn't the user be setting the _idf_diag matrix rather  i agree that setting a private attribute is ugly  so the question is  shouldn't we make it public 
can you provide your matrix  how big is it  how sparse is it  or even better  can you provide some code reproducing the problem 
what do you suggest to eventually throw a warning 
could you give an example of a random state that yields different results on different machines  i assume you find that the results are replicable on a single machine

should we redirect people to so or gitter  is anyone still active on irc 
how did you install scikit learn  with pip or apt  how did you install numpy  with pip or apt 
how did you install and update scikit learn  if you install with conda and update with pip  there will be left over files  i recommend uninstalling  removing the folder entirely  and reinstalling 
could you help us open a pr to fix this  
how did you install scikit learn  have you tried removing and reinstalling 
how much ram to do you have 
how large is the dataset 
what is your data like  why do you expect that it can be modelled well with less then 20 gaussians 
what is  n_jobs   1 
do you want to create a pr with a test 
can you give us a piece of code to reproduce the problem  
why did you need python tk  and matplotlib is not a dependency 
can you please try updating  i am afraid the issue might still exist  though  pr welcome 
what makes you believe it was lost  http   scikit learn org stable developers contributing html#contributing pull requests http   scikit learn org dev developers contributing html#contributing pull requests
can you please provide a self contained example to reproduce  and the full trace back  also  please try using numpy arrays instead of pandas dataframes  though it should work with dataframes 
how about use a sparse matrix of 3d array  some "extra" probability are imported though   
can i work on it and make a pr 
would you be willing to submit a patch and some more robust unit tests than what we presently have 
what makes you think that there is a problem with scikit learn 
do you want to provide a regression test and a fix 
what does the question have to do with scikit learn 
maybe importing the cython function from a pure python script and running the timings there would safer  just to be sure 
could you give us a small example 
what makes you think _binary_clf_curve ever intentionally supported multilabel data  certainly it's not documented as such  not tested as such  and it's called binary for a reason   
do you want to fix it 
does such graph fit in your memory computer 
maybe  jmetzen can comment on this 
may i investigate  work on this   jnothman  
do you have a full reproducible example 
could you please give an example  it is hard to understand what you mean by "none vectors" 
maybe we should rely on the tests to ensure the correctness of the code  another concern is time  1 complete job takes over 40 minutes 
why 0 1 and or why 0 5  i assume we took the default from liblinear  i would rather not change it unless there's significant evidence that the current value doesn't make sense 
do you have know a good implementation with bsd like license 
what is the use case 
shouldn't this correspond to a non active status in openml  are such datasets usable used 
do we need to store the transformer in   transformers_   
why do you believe this is our problem  not jsonpickle's 
can you provide a stand alone script to reproduce the problem   please read https   stackoverflow com help mcve  without this it is very hard for us to provide any kind of help 
why is this an issue 
can reproduce on master   this looks like a regression 
do you think this is a blocker for 0 20  i wouldn't expect so 
what linear algebra backend are you using on mac  conda + mkl or apple accelerate framework 
do u have installed numpy on your system    progyan1997
what do you think 
how did you run the script 
could you add your code for printing the fitted parameters so that others can experiment with this  i agree it looks like the default stopping criterion is a bit premature 
can this be reproduced with the  rbf  kernel as well 
do you expect that kfold yields the same none error that strafitiedkfold  
what's the complete traceback  it's more likely to be a keras issue  i think 
which version of sklearn are you running  this is weird since it looks like you didn't provide   y    but estimator score requires   y    but estimator fit apparently didn't 
do i miss something 
what does verbose 1 output  i would be okay with this kind of change  but we don't have any clear rules for it 
could you check the number of nodes in each grown tree 
can you provide the data 
how would you modify the code  could you open a pr to fix it  cc  amueller who has implemented elkan k means iirc 
could you provide a self contained code example that illustrates that this is not the case 
what do you get from stream_reuters_documents   
could you please provide a full  reproducible code snippet  ideally including the data download   thanks 
what causes the   attributeerror    there's no   __setstate__   defined  can we fix this without explicitly encoding   __slots__   
why not add this to scipy  do you want 1d or n d 
what's wrong with the joblib docs  https   pythonhosted org joblib  did you mean scikit learn specific examples  can you elaborate 
can i take this up  jnothman   this is going to be my first ever open source contribution 
what would the warning say  i wouldn't generally use loo unless i really needed to  repeated k fold might be a better alternative 
can you share your use case 
what type and what dtype  at least  is your data 
can you give a little bit more background on what it does  do you have an example of the demo rendered 
do you want to do a pr with a fix and regression test 
shall i take this 
can i take this 
maybe we should try to document the default base estimator we use  e g    adaboostregressor  is using  decisiontreeregressor max_depth 3   as default  which at least confuse me some time in the past 
which artwork  fwiw 
does passing in labels help  otherwise how is the function to determine which is the positive and which the negative class
why do you believe it is wrong 
what do you want to get  i think it's not difficult to get all the parameters and attributes  e g  
what version of sklearn are you using 
why can't you pipeline a columntransformer into a polynomialfeatures  or do you only want the interaction terms

does this issue apply there 
can i please work on this 
would you like to make a pr for iterativeimputer  
why 
could you try scikit learn 0 19 1 for instance with cython 0 27 3  please 
where's the error  looks all good to me 
can i work on this issue if no one is assigned to it  
does this happen when importing sklearn  or particular submodules  also worth checking if importing joblib alone does this  in which case it should be raised there 
did you scale the features  r might be doing it for you
may i take this as my first fix 
should we close this issue 
can i work on this request 
what is modelfit  please provide a runnable snippet 
what do you say is the right model  elasticnet uses enet_path did you check the parametrization 
how did you choose the initial values  init    1  1 e 3    if this results from some kind of well known initialization strategy  we could probably support it 
would you be interested in making it  politinsa  
how about we do both  we test predict   decision_function on iris and check support vectors on something without duplicate data points  that way we test both things 
maybe  heidiseibold has an r implementation though 
does make html work 
don't we have tests to assess that results are the same across solvers  why is this not picked up  can you provide a non regression test 
does that not work 
why would you expect high accuracy on digits 
maybe you will create a pull request 
why do you want to do that 
can we close this 
do you have an idea of the work necessary for this   i don't  and haven't yet looked into it

what for  it would be inappropriate for non euclidean metrics and non gaussian clusters  and it's not hard to calculate yourself   
what's the relation between pca and pcoa  they seem quite similar but i'm not really familiar with mds and have never heard the term pcoa
can you give a minimal example of what you think should work but doesn't  and what you need to do to get around it 
did you install originally scikit learn via pip or conda 
could you please check if this is resolved when you install the nightly build  and close this issue 
how about   verbose 1   
why do you want it different 
may you update the repo to include the data in another format  like a csv   loading pickles is a little   dangerous 😅
do we have a fix for this 
can you show us how you construct this data 
do people change classes_ in practice 
does replacing the dot with safe_sparse_dot just work  would you like to submit a pr with this patch and a test 
would you want to submit a pr  jhennrich  
how do these functions benefit over gower 
however  i wonder if check_array should issue a warning when doing such conversions  we previously had a  dataconversionwarning  but it was decided to remove it https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 13306 https   github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 13324
what specifically did you update  sklearn

maybe i'm missing something but doesn't scikitlearn metrics _ranking roc_curve also return what you need 
would you have a suggestion to improve the documentation or the error message 
do you agree  
why would one need this feature   is it standard   do you have a paper reference  is it something already solved by the  implemented scalers  https   scikit learn org stable modules preprocessing html#preprocessing scaler   
could you describe your use case   application a bit more  but yes  we could implement densifying each y as we need to    
did you reopen or the previous one didn't help 
why is return_estimator insufficient 
do the inputs really need to be replaced with a new input of type text  is it not enough to just hide the existing input 
could you just check if it works with single words  i have related troubles with list items containing spaces  not styling though  just events  
do you think this is more of a jquery core issue 
can you reproduce this if you take jqm out of the equation  what if you add in a label and associate it to the input 
do you mind adding a link to this ticket on the feature request page  https   github com jquery jquery mobile wiki feature requests   thanks  closing as a feature request

what filesystem are you using for your datadir  for some reason it seems like  bitcoind  is not permitted to query how much free space you have 
can you take a look at debug log and see what it says at the end once bitcoind dies  also check syslog dmesg to see if its getting oom killed 
do you export the resulting dmg to a different system and get the error there  or does this happen even on the same system 
could just be an issue that might be fixed by moving the print statement after the config files and include files have been parsed 
could it be that this is a hardware issue with that machine

when you do that call  does the registry already have the  currentaco  alias set 
does it actually try to write in that directory  most likely it tries to write to a different one instead here for you  what does the logs constant resolve to 
why doesn't the record save

what version of leaflet are you using  you are probably getting touchstart and touchend events instead
can you link to a jsfiddle or example page 
what if you don't set any center zoom until you get to the fitbounds point 
did you try using  moveend  but with a smaller delay  say  50ms 
maybe try removing the map unproject calls when making your latlngbounds  do you ever get a  2 or just  1  
what's your particular use case  usually you have to recreate the layer array when you're retrieving items in batch from the server  so syncing like this won't work   
did you try it in the master version 
what's the exception   aka i'm too lazy to run ie8 right now  thanks   
can you make a jsfiddle with this

can you please post the code that triggers this  a jsfiddle  or a link to a page with this error

what exactly are you trying to do  surely there is a simpler way  you seem to have a 'self image_file'  why can't you just use that directly 
what is your kivy version  could you share a minimal app example which shows the issue 
do you have logs  examples  etc 
what do you think  tito  it should be easy to add  
doesn't a space character or escape with     color   work 
could you verify this  http   packages ubuntu com trusty libsdl2 dev
could you share a gist with the errors 
could you post the main py file for testing 
maybe not fully connected display to the rpi 
did you try the kivy pong example from the examples tutorials pong folder so there's no coding error  or maybe just try the touchtracer example 
can you check the values of these environment variables in your app  please post the values  also check whether those paths is actually where the gstreamer dlls actually are 
can you add an example to test this 
what do you mean by 'flag a new release'  all new releases are announced on the forums and the website updated 
could this be pygame  do you have sdl2 installed  a full log would be nice 
do we have any spare  😄
could you share the code you're running 
can you try with master 
how did you install it 
could you share a runnable example 
could you share your home folder path 
do we have a plan to fix it 
did you installed latest pip  wheel setuptools  if not then run 
what happens if you add this before the first line of your code 
where did you get numpy from  pip  if so  uninstall and use numpy from http   www lfd uci edu  gohlke pythonlibs  
when you talk about z index  it's the index of the widget in the its parent children list right 
could you test with the latest  master  branch  please 
could you try with the #5406 changes if it fixes the issue 
does it happen in your application even on non rpi devices 
where do you want it to start 
can you share the logs with  python main py  c kivy log_level trace    maybe there will be more interesting info there  also  just in case  try with kivy master  instead of 1 10 0 
can you switch to xorg and confirm 
can you uninstall  check your dependencies and try again  if you run  pip install  with   v  you'll see the compilation output  if it still fails  please post that here  too 
did you add  ttf  to  source include_exts  in buildozer spec file  example 
maybe it would be better to document and provide snippet for users 
can you share the log of the compilation  img_sdl2 don't even appear so something is wrong  we are now requiring sdl_image 2 0 2 as a minimum so double check that 
could you provide a gif or video that demonstrate the issue  what sdl2 version do you have used   i remember old one were having issue with monitors and dpi 
can you post the full kivy log  maybe take some screenshots to show the issue 
do you expect it to  if it doesn't  could you provide a minimal runnable example where the problem does happen 
can you share the code that reproduce the issue 
did you install  kivy deps sdl2  
do you at all create kivy widgets or change their properties etc from another thread 
can you either try with current master  or downgrade kivy deps sdl2 to an older version and see if it fixes it 
can you run it from the virtual environment  to activate it again do  kivy_venv scripts activate  
why are you using angle  doesn't sdl2 work 
can you please provide a minimal reproducible example 
can you try this   canvas_color   0  0  0  0  #comment  
may i suggest plyer's native file chooser  i switched to it recently and it was much better  given it's using the os's built in file browser 
can you try using pyinstaller  3 5 
what format are you using  srt 
which version are you using 
how are you thinking it would work  would it be an option that overrides the fullscreen button to only do full window  or just an api call 
can we expand on this specific use case here  what's the original reason for accessing the tech 
what kind of device are you seeing this on 
can you provide a test case on jsbin or public url that demonstrates the issue 
maybe with a link to upgrade it 
can you gist the full code to see whats going on  i tested on chrome version 22 0 1229 94
what's your version   os 
how would you detect keyboard vs click 
what  that's crazy   document all  exists in firefox and chrome but   document all  evaluates to true      http   media boingboing net wp content uploads 2012 12 mind blown_thumb1 gif  also  while useragent switching isn't great  it's mostly ok for testing for old browsers 
why is the black screen an issue  and is that specifically in browsers where flash is used 
do you see value in having that option for development 
do we really need support for a browser which is not popular and not supported by creators 
what browser are you using  what mime type is the browser returning  usually 206 with videojs means a bad mime type 
do you have an example online somewhere of that file  or could you  create a jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog 13 edit  that shows the issue  also  which browser platform is it working on 
can you provide an example of where or how it's not working 
can you post this issue on the repos for one or both of those specific plugin projects 
do you have an isolated test case  here is an example of live video  http   jsfiddle net rsadwick 9tws4  make sure you're waiting until videojs is ready before trying to play 
can you describe a little bit more in detail the process where this happens  what is the user doing and what error is being triggered 
what version of video js are you using  i was able to get something similar working in  jsbin  http   jsbin com ahanuna 1 edit  and there isn't an issue on safari 6 0 4 
can you provide any more details about the systems you're seeing this on 
would you be able to and interested in submitting a fix  thanks 
could you explain more what you mean  and is there and example you could show where the issue is happening 
do you have an example available online i can take a look at  if not  would you mind making a  jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog 13 edit  demo that reproduces the problem 
which browser are you using  and is there live web page where we could see this happening 
how are you setting  el  
can you provide some more details around what you're doing  can you modify this fiddle to get the same error  http   jsfiddle net heff zzxfb    screen shot 2014 01 28 at 11 21 35 am  https   f cloud github com assets 166 2022697 91749b7c 8851 11e3 9b99 e9da0ceef44f png 
did you try 'application x mpegurl' for the type  http   www videojs com projects mimes html
does the page to consistently throw an error when you run  document createelement 'video'  volume   if so we could probably use that 
does that help   closing the issue but feel free to continue the conversation 
could you post a minimal test case showcasing your problem to a site like jsbin com or jsfiddle net 
which version of android and browser  the website plays fine for me on multiple devices 
what path did you take to get to that page  the release that went out yesterday should now send you to the latest version where the link is fixed  https   github com videojs video js blob stable docs guides api md
can you explain the use case around this more  what scenarios would this be valuable in 
which chrome version and which windows version 
do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this 
what does the button do in the player  a live example might be nice  maybe there's a better way of doing it that doesn't cause the player to break 
does bower actually respect the gitignore  that's lame then 
does this also happen with a vanilla video element 
what does your webvtt file look like 
do you have the full log  also  if you have any ideas of how to handle too many errors in this case 
can you a test case with chapters not working please  thanks 
why not just set html5 as the default tech 
do you have a reduced test case for this example somewhere 
can you put something up on  jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog 999 edit  that reproduces the issue 
does it work if you wait the length of the video  handbrake should have a "for web" setting you can use for encoding 
can you please make a reduced test case for this   jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog 999 edit  would be great 
what do you think 
does it happen with just an empty data setup 
what would you see as the main benefits of making a brightcove player tech   dmlap  gkatsev  any thoughts on this one 
how are you rotating it  css 
does any browser play the video without error   with native html5  not flash 
do you see the same problem if you use a vanilla video element 
does your workaround solve the problem well enough in the meantime  if someone else runs into the same problem i'll point them to this thread 
do you have flash installed  what's the input file  are you also having trouble playing back the video on  videojs com  http   videojs com  with ie8 
does the player ever fire  click  events  what are you trying to have happen specifically 
what version of video js  would you mind making a  reduced test case  http   jsbin com axedog latest  
would you mind setting up a reduced test case on something like  jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog latest edit  
do you have flash installed 
how are setting autoplay  what attributes do you have on the video element when videojs is invoked 
what version of video js are you using 
would you mind submitting the issue on the swf repo  and if there's any way we could set up a live example that would help move this along  https   github com videojs video js swf
can you reproduce this online somewhere for us to help debug 
what browser are you seeing this on  what type of video  would be best if you can set up a test case on a site like jsbin com 
can you put something up on  jsbin  http   jsbin org axedog latest edit  or something that shows the error  here's a  working example  http   jsbin com gevebo 5  using flash and  paused  
what happens when you use that with the flash tech  it should work there too 
what os are you running  windows i presume  given the ie11 reference   any other details you can give 
what browsers does it support 
can you create a reduced test case using something like  jsbin  http   jsbin com axedog latest edit  
can you provide any more information  is it specific to your site 
what's the reason for not wanting to use   vjs fluid   closing since this is a question that doesn't need action  but we can keep talking in the comments 
would you mind creating a  reduced test case  http   jsbin com axedog latest edit  for us 
how are you testing ie8  are you _actually_ using ie8 or  emulation mode  2012  
can you provide more info on your setup  what version of videojs you are using  etc  unfortunately  your test link is down  thanks 
maybe ask vid me if they could do a writeup of how they accomplished it 
maybe file a bug with the microsoft ie team 
could you post a reduced test case on jsbin  also  is there a particular reason you're using the prerelease of 5 0  how are you getting videojs  thanks 
does less allow for you to import vanilla css into a project 
can you check out 5 0  in prerelease right now  and see if it works for you  you can download it in the releases  https   github com videojs video js releases
what browser are you using 
what browser   os are you using 
would you be able to try the 5 0 branch and see if that works any better  http   jsbin com sofiwu edit html console output
what exactly are you trying to achieve  do you not want the seekbar  if so  you could set  seekbar  to false when initializing the new   progresscontrol   https   github com videojs video js blob master src js control bar progress control progress control js  component 
do you think you could set up a jsbin showing the issue  http   jsbin com axedog
does it work on mac safari 
what video js version are you using 
what version  what version of video js 
can you please provide more info about the usecase  why would you want to swap to a different video based on what tech is loaded

what version are you using    screenshot  https   cloudup com czegtjumfxy+ 
can you try with v5 and see if you get the same issues  http   jsbin com zuqeroxexa edit html console output
how are you testing locally  are you using a local webserver or opening the file directly in the browser  flash will not load unless you're using a local webserver 
where in your document is the video js   script   element  i think your proposed solution sounds fairly reasonable  though  i'm not sure how common this scenario might be 
can you provide a reduced test case  at first glance  it would seem like it would be an issue with videojs offset plugin but not sure 
what version of videojs are you using 
would you happen to have an example or could you put together than example  thanks 
what type of errors are you getting 
why would you insert a link though   i mean  wouldn't a click handler on the player element be much simpler in this case   just wondering 
how are you adding this attribute  have a reduced test case 
what is the behaviour with plain video elements without video js 
can you elaborate on the question please  by default  videojs wraps the players in a div and also creates a big play button component 
can i ask you to re open this issue against the  docs   videojs docs  repo  would be greatly appreciated  thanks 
does it work better if you use  canplay  event instead 
what does the rest of the player look like 
what version of videojs  any videojs plugin  what type of media are you trying to play  if you can provide a reduced test case  that would be even better 
does it happen with any specific versions of videojs 5  also  are you able to provide a reduced test case for this  thanks 
do you have a reduced test case available 
would you happen to be using browserify or webpack 
would you be willing to write a short blurb for it in the guides  perhaps as another section in https   github com videojs video js blob master docs guides setup md 
do you have any more information about your set up 
does it work correctly if you do  grunt jshint  itself  or does it only break when you run  grunt dev  
can you provide a reduced test case please  in all my tests  i cannot reproduce a broken full screen button on safari 
can you submit a pr against the stable branch for this  it would make it a lot easier for us to merge it in 
what format are you using for the livestream  only rtsp  or hls 
does it still give entire sentences   or is it like continuously trying to read the start of the line  
can you please provide a  reduced test case  https   css tricks com reduced test cases    it would make it a lot easier for us to reproduce the issue you are experiencing and thus fixing it 
how is video js being included in your ember app 
do you mean the audio tracks button  can you explain what you want to achieve 
do you have a reduced test case  only thing i can think off is that your page styles or the videojs resolution styles are somehow messing up with videojs styles 
does it happen on just one version of video js or across multiple versions  a reduced test case that triggers the behavior every time is always helpful 
what if we decide to add an  autosetresolution  method  as an example  we have no such plans 
do facebook use anything like swf verification 
can you re open this issue against  that repo  https   github com brightcove videojs contextmenu ui issues new   thanks 
which version were you using when it worked and which version are you using now 
maybe try pausing before changing the current time  that might work  but it also might not because changing the current time is  in fact  a time update 
what version of video js are you using 
would you mind trying that  you can install it via  npm install video js next  
can you elaborate on what exactly you're trying to do  we'd be able to give a better answer then 
how about checking  player videoheight    
would you be able to provide a reduced test case that showcases the issue  you can use the started template that's linked from the  issue template  https   github com videojs video js blob master  github issue_template md  
would you be able to re open the issue on that repo   https   github com videojs videojs contrib hls  thanks 
what's the url  does it play in the player at http   videojs github io videojs contrib hls  
can you create a test page from  this template   http   jsbin com axedog edit html output  that demonstrates the problem so that we can better understand the issue you are encountering 
can you elaborate what you mean  the source code is in es6 and compiled via babel before publishing to npm  so  it isn't directly the same thing 
do you have a live example  are the captions in manifest  if so  it would probably be up to hljs and the videojs contrib hls js to provide the captions to the browser videojs 
would you be able to provide a reduced test case   dom isreal  was introduced in 5 16 0 which is what   types videojs  is built against 
can you update to videojs flash 2 0 0  i think videojs videojs flash#10 will have fixed this for you 
can you update it following the  issue template  https   github com videojs video js blob master  github issue_template md  
would you be able to create a reduced live test case please  i'm not familiar with angular much 
would you be interested in making the change 
did it somehow get dropped from the latest version of video js 
can you elaborate on what you mean by the control bar ui not being reset 
how are you creating a player 
does it make a difference if you change the sources to  blood mp4 1    blood mp4 2  etc 
can you submit a pr  if not  i can help out   i think this fix may help with my issue with #4599's layout 
do you want to disable text track settings dialog  or do you want to close a particular dialog 
what is available on some ie versions but not others 
what's the output of ffprobe or mediainfo 
what's your specific usecase 
would you be able to provide a reduced test case  would help a lot in reproducing locally 
would you be interested in making a pr for that  i'd be happy to help you figure out what needs to happen 
why do you have to cast it to  any   is it because the typings for the player don't include plugin methods 
do the tracks show up on a non chromecast player with the same source 
can you provide a reduced test case please  also  which version of chrome on which os  i cannot reproduce locally 
do you have a reduced test case we can take a look at  also  what browser and os is this on  also  what version of video js 
would you be interested in making a pr to add that field 
can you elaborate on what you mean by cover and "mobile terminal click"  are you saying that you can't click on the player area to begin playback on mobile 
what's your usecase  maybe we can help out some more 
did you have any thoughts on what our behavior should be when the value given isn't just a number 
may i ask where on our website you found that link 
how are you loading the source into the player  i've tried loading it as type video mp4 and it's been working great so far 
can you please share any other information you have that might help us reproduce this issue   ex  ios version  errors you are seeing in the console  etc

can you create a reduced test case 
which skin generator  i'd suspect it's designed for an older version of video js
what exactly are the symptoms you are seeing 
did you run this in  cmd exe  or powershell  i assume that command won't work there right now  i would suggest trying out wsl or just disable that command for now 
which browser were you testing against  the pip button will only currently show up in chrome 
how did you import videojs into your porject  please post more information 
which version you're using  
does it happen in the code pen or only on your site 
do you have a sample  does this happen on windows or macos or both  just tried locally on macos and it loaded fine 
can you please provide a  reduced test case  https   css tricks com reduced test cases    it would make it a lot easier for us to reproduce the issue you are experiencing and helping you fix 
do you have a link to the project 
what did i do    sob 
do you know what is missing from the version we're running  we're on sphinx 1 2 2  but i dunno if that has anything to do with it 
did you happen to re tag this version at some point  or have a branch with the same name 
do you know who originally set it up  looks like  hannosch    might be worthwhile contacting him to get him to switch ownership 
what project is this and can you link to your repo 
can you explain a bit more about what is not working 
maybe did you integrated two github accounts to your rtd account 
can you send me a link to a page where you have commented code output  i'll get that fixed tonight 
can you rebuild and see if this is still happening  should hopefully be fixed 
what commands are you expecting to be run  i haven't found a sane way to support submodules  because people seem to use them differently everywhere 
maybe i haven't activated my account 
what are the url's 
can you try that  please 
can anyone else verify that a modification to conf py alleviates this error 
did you try this faq entry  http   docs readthedocs org en latest faq html#i get import errors on libraries that depend on c modules
what is missing from the docs that you think should be there 
what version of sphinx are you using locally   1 3 
could you elaborate  i'm not sure i follow this issue 
could you include a link to the project 
what os are you running  i tested it in osx  firefox 38 and it disappears as expected 
can you see any errors for the build on https   readthedocs org  
could it be that mkdocs assets are not stored on the cdn 
what project are you working on  it would be good if i could have a look at the build output that is causing those issues 
maybe could you write a bit more about how your current workflow for changes to the english version vs changes to the translations is 
what is the specific rule that effects this  i'd be +1 on a change to scope the css more granularly 
can you point at the code bits that you expect the creation of the directories should happen during git imports  that would make investigating a lot easier  cheers    
what do you get as an error  do you see a http 500 page 
do your docs build locally 
which settings  py file are you using 
do you have both of these running on localhost on the default ports

can you confirm 
can you be more specific about the problem you are having if isn't about the 404 
can you confirm  18 0 2  is problematic 
does this work locally for you  you'll need to install latex and pdf generation tooling 
what version of pip was used in the virtualenv 
could you help me please 
what do you mean by "only works"  i see passing builds  is there output missing somewhere  this seems to be an authoring issue  not a bug with rtd 
what is your rtd account now 
can i do something  — you are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread  reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 2111#issuecomment 205271097
does this happen to new builds projects only  i'm having the same issues http   sklearn evaluation readthedocs io en latest 
did you try to "wipe" the version on rtd  see "versions" tab  and then re build 
can you edit with error pasted as a code block  not a quoted comment 
what url did you register at 
what is the suggested fix here  it seems like you need to specify a newer version of sphin which fixes this issue 
can you replicate the issue by executing the same build command locally  it might take set up of our extension locally as well 
can you give your build number for your browser  theme issues can be filed here  https   github com rtfd sphinx_rtd_theme
what url are you noticing this issue 
maybe we can fix that by doing a  wipe  of that version and re build   lwm can you try that 
can you clarify it a bit  do you want to remove this documentation http   glusterfs readthedocs org  do you own that project  who does 
can you try building again 
should we include that in the message about what to report 
which version of sphinx are you using locally 
do you have an idea of how long the timeout should be set to  for your case 
did you change something  otherwise we can close this issue 
does installing the version of pillow that you require in your environment help 
can we fix that somehow ourselves 
maybe this is a conda problem  can you try building locally 
could you solve the other problem 
do you have a test case or a version of this happening on readthedocs org  we can't do much with this as currently reported 
can you take a look at this 
maybe the same as https   github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 893  i think you can deactivate each tag version in the  versions  section 
did you solve the problem 
what was the problem 
did you try by wiping your versions  i imported this project in my local instance and i got the proper versions selected    captura de pantalla_2018 03 05_20 51 27  https   user images githubusercontent com 244656 37009934 1677e638 20b7 11e8 98fb aefffe98c3ed png 
can you provide more information  your project url  requirements file  etc  you can use the sphinx version that you want by putting it on your requirements file
while i can't promise anything  would you be looking for 
could you elaborate on the submodule config  that might help us determine the cause here  as i'm not quite sure what this error is currently 
do you also remove the webhook from read the docs   integrations  on the admin section  
can you try building your docs again manually  i think this was a temporal problem 
could you perhaps convert your doc into markdown in a github repository  and use that to  quickstart a read the docs page   https   github com rtfd readthedocs org#quickstart for github hosted projects 
did you try importing manually your project  https   readthedocs org dashboard import manual 
do you mean the badges aren't shown on http   phate readthedocs io en dev   i'm using firefox  maybe a cache thing  try  ctrl + f5  to update the page 
maybe a cache issue    screenshot 2018 5 24 search nathaniel hoefer reference 1 0 documentation  https   user images githubusercontent com 4975310 40516938 924e135e 5f78 11e8 8575 8dc92b6f5862 png 
could you provide that data that was in the issue template  please  this is  username   project url  and a way to reproduce your issue  thanks 
did you try setting this in your rtd configuration file  https   docs readthedocs io en latest yaml config html#build image
did you try building this locally  does it work with py3 6 
can we keep the conversation just in one issue  or i misunderstood and those are different problems 
did you try wiping the environment before triggering a build   versions    edit    wipe 
what do you think 
maybe a file with wrong encoding 
can you please check now 
can you please try rebuilding  latest  or  master   that way the versions are refreshed 
can you also increase the memory limit  https   readthedocs org projects oapackage builds 7942643  there are no error details  so i cannot see exactly where in the installation the error is generated 
what are the requirements to use this feature  maybe there is something that needs to be installed 
what i can see is conda installing a new version of python now  3 7 instead of 3 6   maybe some incompatible packages 
can you describe what happened to get into this state 
does this work locally for you 
did you try building with python3  you can change this in the admin panel of your project or using a configuration file https   docs readthedocs io en latest yaml config html
maybe this is a sphinx bug  also  to pin dependencies using conda we have this https   github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 3829  we are waiting for a conda release 
did you read this https   docs readthedocs io en latest guides build using too many resources html  if that doesn't help  i'll investigate a little more  also  you can request more time memory is nothing else helps 
does this error happen because conda uses too much memory  i think it can be  i'll test this locally later
when a version is inactive  the docs are deleted  so i guess google will stop to show those results 
when building your docs locally  do you see the same behavior  i don't think this is a rtd issue  i think you need https   docs python org 3 library functools html#functools wraps
maybe a build to master was triggered by a webhook  can you check the webhook responses   if there is a push to develop  what branches are marked to build 
do you notice the same issue when building locally 
which docs aren't up to date  i can see that the last change  howto  are here https   sentinl readthedocs io en latest howto alerts in dashboard 
can you trying wiping the version first  admin    versions    edit    wipe

can you provide a live test case to reproduce 
can you try again  this is working for me now  possibly try maybe add a   v  option and report back  sounds like a npm problem
which browser environment are you using 
which device and browser are you seeing this on 
could you elaborate please 
how are you calling replicate  
doesn't couchdb2 0 have support for clustered replication  http   docs couchdb org docs couchdb en latest cluster index html
do you know if that's happening 
what is  body  in your example  i think we need  id  instead 
can anyone else confirm  or write a test that reproduces this error 
which version of pouch are you using  and which version of node webkit  can you try this  node webkit hello world  https   github com nolanlawson node webkit pouchdb demo  and see if it works on your machine 
can you submit a pull request  looks like our  issafari  check could be something like 
which browser  which adapter 
can you write a live reproducible test case please  i don't see anything obviously wrong here  so it would be helpful to have a live example 
what database are you using that returns a single doc when  open_revs  is passed in  can you provide a live test to reproduce 
may you provide more details about your issue  
did you try auto compaction  as for the database getting too big on ios  the only real solution is the  sqlite plugin  https   github com litehelpers cordova sqlite storage  
did you try it with various browsers 
do you get the same issues with the latest release 
will take a look at this  have you tried  include_docs  
what is the environment  are you using the sqlite plugin  what kind of device browser os 
maybe give that a try 
can you take a look at the console network tab and see if there's any http request that failed  also a screenshot may be helpful 
can you provide some more detail  is it a website or an app  what are you doing to cause the error  can you provide a screenshot

what happens when you visit that url in your browser 
how do you set the credentials  in the constructor or on the actual request 
which version of couchdb 
could you open a pr with this change  looks like the place to put the change would be  this line of code  https   github com pouchdb pouchdb blob 21e1346e11e611f1d312f468a711389038b04287 src adapters http index js#l150  
what version of chrome are you using 
can you provide a test case to reproduce 
did you follow the steps described in https   github com nolanlawson pouchdb electron   most importantly  did you rebuild leveldown for electron  if so  then yeah  this is definitely a bug 
don't suppose you can make a test to reproduce  e g  an android "hello world" app or a simple web page that reproduces this error 
did you find a solution for this  just curious 
what is your use case 
can you provide some sample code or ideally a full project to reproduce the issue  what do you mean by "a time out" 
what happened when you removed  target  'electron'  
can you raise a ticket with cloudant support please 
do you have a live repro to demonstrate by any chance

can you post a code example that fails 
maybe try this question on stackoverflow instead

can you check if  npm i leveldown   save  works in your folder 
can you depend on  pouchdb browser   to use the browser only version  there is also https   github com stockulus pouchdb react native which looks specifically for react native
do you have examples of projects libraries that correctly use  whatwg fetch  in the context of  pouchdb

can you give the url you used 
can you point to an example 
why not enable it for everyone 
does iqdb have a  json  api or something we can use 
do you need the uploader's name almost every time you use the post api  i don't

maybe cloudflare caching  can you access the md5 hash on s3  the format is https   s3 amazonaws com danbooru md5 ext

what do i expect the document to produce 
could you run  bundle update  and try again  out of curiosity what version of jekyll were you running 
what would be a good template language fit for you  it's not like you have plenty of choice when it comes to ssg  https   www staticgen com   
what jekyll version are you running  http   localhost 4000 is already the default in development environment since jekyll 3 3   jekyll_env development bundle exec jekyll build  should default to http   localhost 4000 
could you explain a bit more about the use case for this  when would this actually be used in a real world situation 
maybe something like that could work for you

did you follow our docs  https   jekyllrb com docs windows #installing jekyll
how can somebody recreate this issue

do you have a sample repo we can look at  easier to figure out what's going on if the source is available 
what's your context  looks like you need to exclude  vendor bundle  from your build 
however if you want this set in stone then maybe we could link to these tutorials in the official docs  maybe in https   jekyllrb com tutorials home  or https   jekyllrb com resources   what do you day  dirtyf

did you restart r after installing the new version of ggplot2  simply detaching and re loading the package doesn't always work properly

can you try this with the development version  it is potentially fixed
could you please provide a minimal reproducible example 
could you please run  devtools  package_deps "ggplot2"

can you please produce a reprex using the reprex package 
did the errors occur when you ran  install packages "ggplot2"    or later

what does git history indicate   aselder 
what's  args "mail_message"   look like 
could you share more about the context in which you've seen multiple delivery crop up as a usage risk 
could you try the 2 7 1 rc1 gem 
do you have a test case we could use to demonstrate the failure  and prevent future regression 
could you attach or link to a sample email to reproduce  this is likely an issue with quoted printable transfer encoding  which is not safe for pdfs or binaries 
which version are you using  that was a bug i thought we fixed some time ago 
maybe the issue is with middleware order  debugtoolbarmiddleware should be before flatpagefallbackmiddleware as any other middleware  it is easy to oversight this if some variation of "local_settings py" pattern is used 
would it be overkill if the  header_filter  list were a config setting itself and you could update it to suit your needs 
do you have firebug  can you install it and check for js erros 
what might that look like  i know django can support it as well 
can you provide a full traceback please 
can you try with the latest ddt  diff   git a ddt_issue requirements txt b ddt_issue requirements txt index db3204f  a497a10 100644     a ddt_issue requirements txt +++ b ddt_issue requirements txt     1 2 +1 2     django 1 3 1  django debug toolbar 0 8 3 +django  1 3 1 +django debug toolbar
do you have debugtoolbarmiddleware before sessionmiddleware 
what's the problem you're having  it works fine for me with gae 1 8 3
could you apply this patch to your local installation and confirm that it fixes the issue 
can you figure out which key in  wsgi_env  triggers this problem  the wsgi environment isn't expected to contain non string keys 
can you try the code from the master branch 
docs seem correct to me in master  https   github com django debug toolbar django debug toolbar blob master docs panels rst#settings where did you see the old name 
what happens if you set the hide_in_stacktraces option to an empty list in the debug_toolbar_config setting 
can you try the explicit setup described in the documentation and see if it fixes your problem 
can you wipe any installed version of the toolbar  re install it  and see if that fixes the issue 
do you have an error in the javascript console 
can you provide the full stack trace please 
what browser 
can you test with the master branch  i've made changes to how jquery is loaded  that might help 
could you provide the full traceback for this exception 
can you provide the stack trace until the point where it enters a loop 
can you provide the exact definition of the foreignkey  it might be incorrect 
can you check if disabling the profiling panel solves the issue 
what changes is this issue requesting 
what version of the toolbar are you using  edit  are you using a css framework for the frontend  if so  which one 
does that work  and if not  what are the problems  media file serving in development is always slow  or  are you running ddt on your production servers 
do you happen to have  template_string_if_invalid  https   docs djangoproject com en 1 7 ref settings #std setting template_string_if_invalid  set 
how are you performing the upgrade  with  pip install  u django debug toolbar  
can you please provide us with a test case 
does it go away after a couple of refreshes  not saying that it's not a bug  just assessing the severity 
what version of django are you using  what's the query you're using  how exactly is it breaking 
when you're using the explicit setup  what exactly is happening  does the toolbar not show up or does the development web server not start up 
do you have  'debug_toolbar'  included in it 
can you include more details 
can you submit a patch 
could you offer a suggestion for improving the wording 
what's the use case for that 
did you use explicit setup to enable ddt on your project 
can you post the urls py of your project  check that there is no strings in the url patterns 
do you get a javascript error in the console or somewhere  are the debug toolbar assets loaded correctly 
does it work if you move the  get_show_toolbar  import in  decorators py  inside  def inner  
do you want to send a pull request  i'd appreciate it 
which database are you referring to 
do you have a chance of profiling the panel to find out where the problem might be  no quick ideas unfortunately    
do you have more details about how to reproduce or a minimal example project 
what are the contents of  query  in your case 
do you have any idea what might be replacing  request post  with an incompatible data type 
maybe logging sql queries to the console is an option for you  https   avilpage com 2018 05 django tips tricks log sql queries to console html
do you have anything installed that might be impacting  pstats stats  
can you give us more details on what your test scenario  what action is resulting in a 400 
can you give me the full queryset that's problematic 
can you provide a test case that reproduces this issue 
what platform are you on  i tried it here and it seems to work ok 
what pyqt4  python  and os version are you using 
would it be okay if we removed fontui altogether and always use the system default  the fontdiff issue is interesting because we're using qfont tostring   and qfont fromstring   
do you have any tracebacks available 
can you just click into the commit message editor and start typing  i'm curious whether this is a pyqt bug because we don't have this problem 
do you happen to have an example file i can use for testing  i'll see what we can do 
can you share what you're naming the new remote 
do you have one  what are its contents  is it valid json  it might be at     config git cola settings      i'm not sure  the path changed at one point 
what version of cola  i recall fixing a similar issue quite recently  have you tried the latest master 
does that work better 
would  alt+ctrl+0  work  my coworker uses xmonad and i also noticed that the alt+# bindings were being trumped by his xmonad configuration  i'm certainly open to adjusting them 
what version are you using  works for me tm      you can do   and it'll show you the version 
what os are you on  does it happen for all repos  what happens after you hit the "refresh" button   ctrl+r 
can you try the latest version from the source tree and let me know if it's better there  i agree that what you describe is the desired behavior 
would that be helpful  or were you just curious 
what version  this seems like a repeat of #174 i actually use local overrides all the time  what platform are you on 
do share    got an  svg 
what terminal are you using   could it be that its mimedata url handling code is adding the newlines 
why should that check run on any commit other than an amend commit 
do you have a sense of the extent of the actions that would be needed  it seems like it boils down to one action   git deps  commit    correct 
maybe upgrade diff view to diff preview 
what version of git cola are you using  that code underwent a major overhaul in version 2 1 0  and it looks like you may be using an older version 
can you explain how to recreate this kind of setup  i'm sure we can make this work again 
what "path" did you enter  that config variable is the tool name  not a path  custom tools must be registered with git difftool  built in tools include meld  xxdiff  etc https   git scm com docs git difftool
can you please let me know if that's working for you 
what's the best way to convey that 
can you elaborate a bit 
shouldn't this kind of issues sent to the package's maintainer instead of the upstream 
can you check this is your case too 
can you provide the source code  a quick scan at the source code doesn't reveal the issue instantly   
do you think it's the same 
how do you see this work  add tests to fitnesse itself  or can we trigger dependent builds  should we move everything in one big repository 
what did the output  error log  say 
can you provide a little more context 
can this issue be closed 
how about open a pull request 
what do you mean by "remove a property tag from step"  you open a page  change the page properties  tools  properties   in a particular way so the properties xml becomes corrupt 
which version are you referring to 
can we close this issue 
did i miss anything 
can you provide steps to reproduce your situation 
what does "done" mean 
did you also set the permissions on the page properties screen 
do you by any change recall which fitnesse version that was 
what exactly are you missing 
did you have a particular situation where this failed  or was it an old java version you were running on 
do you have this also in your suite  i had no time to debug it but fixed it by moving the suite setup page to a different level 
what did you do to trigger this exception 
what does the   domainstep  annotation do  it is not part of fitnesse 
can you please add a description for this issue  what do you want to achieve 
when moving a user guide page  
could it be similar in any way to issue #995   the solution for multi byte chars is outlined there  it seems related to the version you mention 
must it not be class authenticator  kind regards six42
can you elaborate 
did it changed anything 
what are you trying tot accomplish  if  for example  you need certain system properties to change  it should be simple enough to do so from a fixture 
can you share the wiki content to reproduce this  i'm pretty sure i've seen this before with a table that was not properly formatted
can you elaborate what you are trying to achieve  maybe i can offer a workaround 
did you encounter any issue with this simplistic approach 
does fitnesse work as expected otherwise  does the test pass using an earlier release   i did run that test on macos before making the release and it was green  
can i ask why you need want to pass arguments this way  what are you trying to achieve 
could you double check if you're using the right url   without properties or edit in the parameters 
do you have any local changes  i don't recall having this problem locally and the  travis ci build  https   travis ci org fhoeben fitnesse jobs 653781665  is also green   
can i see the full trace  pass   t  to rake 
can you please post some code  either as a git repo or a gist  that reproduces this 
why was this closed  when was it fixed  was it not related to rake  i fixed by locking rake to 0 8 7 in my gemfile 
how to reproduce 
what's the environment and steps to reproduce this 
does this only happen when using the wire

can you confirm 
where have you read it's not

could you let me know where this fails  and possibly send me a stack trace  is it while running rake friendly_id redo_slugs 
could you possibly give it a try and let me know if it solves your problem 
what version of friendly_id are you using  i'm pretty sure this is fixed in the most recent version 
what version of friendlyid are you using  i   just   released 2 3 0  which should fix this issue 
did you include the the friendly_id gem in  environment rb  
can you send some actual code that shows the problem so i can see how you are using friendlyid  and reproduce the error 
can you show me an example

which library requires this  i see you've put the fix next to  global pointback mode   but that mode doesn't use  called interactively p  
which emacs version do you have  when i saw the same issue it was with an emacs snapshot from a couple of months ago  iirc 
what platform are you on 
which emacs version are you on 
did you mean to file this on the  cider project  https   github com clojure emacs cider   i think that's probably where the ticket belongs 
can you give me any more information so that i can investigate 
what is the output of the following shell command 
can you paste the css as a gist  perhaps 
which emacs version do you have 
did it work when you re started emacs 
does it work if you comment out the   require 'init ido   line in  init el  
did you figure this out 
what's your emacs version 
does that help      i'll add this info to the readme 
what are the emacs versions on the different machines  i've got a very recent emacs here 
should you perhaps be using  'default frame alist   rather than  'default frame  
did you file a bug report for the crash 
which version of emacs do you have 
would you mind confirming 
can you give me an example that i can reproduce  and which emacs version do you have   p s  i have noticed some quirks with  electric pair mode  myself  
what is this  after load' macro for 
what's in   messages    is there any sign that packages were being downloaded and installed 
did you install this config on  win 8 1  
what emacs version do you have 
which emacs version do you have  in the latest head version   electric indent inhibit  is set to  t  by  python mode   so  electric indent mode  isn't active there 
do you have the latest slime package  and which common lisp implementation are you using  i'll give this a try myself when i get a few minutes 
which emacs version do you have  with which shell  and on what platform 
what's changed with the mouse scrolling 
how were you setting the proxies  or are you on a mac  and relying on  init proxies el  
what changed today  did you change or update code  or your system 
do you see the problem when starting emacs in the terminal  or creating a terminal frame using emacsclient  i've tried both with my emacs and can't reproduce this 
which emacs version 
did you use the filename  lisp init_local el  as you wrote above  or  lisp init local el   it should be the latter 
does this help  https   github com purcell emacs d issues 303  
which version of emacs are you using  and on which platform 
what happens when you use  m    to evaluate   executable find "git"   
which type of erb files    html erb   can you provide a sample 
could you clarify please 
what is the problem you have found 
maybe not all of your packages installed cleanly  does  m x find library  allow you to find the  vc darcs  library 
how does it implement the code folding in this mode 
what sort of difference in time are you seeing 
do you know which file it's trying to save at that point 
what platform are you on  and is the emacs you're using built with support for a graphical frontend 
what versions of emacs and os are you using  what are the steps to reproduce this 
did you try restarting emacs  and or killing  not closing with  q   the  ibuffer  window  also  what vc backends are used by the buffers you currently have open 
what does the rest think 
what kind of files might you want to ignore when running  say   reek lib   reek will already only scan   rb  files 
which version of reek are you using 
doesn't this mean it's best to flag  all  shelling out as dangerous  that would make sense to me 
why dont you pull the if   else inside one format json call  thats what you should do in any case imho since it expresses your intention clearer 
can you try narrowing it down to a single file  or perhaps even just a small piece of code 
do you experience issues locating the source of the detected smells without the column 
can you try isolating the exact code that blows up   it seems  https   github com troessner reek blob v3 4 0 lib reek ast sexp_extensions rb#l198 l200  like an  attr  call with no arguments…
can you please post the destroy method as well  and what reek version 
does the problem go away if you remove the irresponsiblemodule bit 
do you gather usage statistics for the tool maintainer so we can see in what contexts and how reek was used 
can you try excluding just  devise  twofactorauthenticationcontroller   also  this detector should trigger on the _definition_ of the method  not on its _use_  i'm guessing  devise  twofactorauthenticationcontroller  is where it is defined 
what else do you need  an official release 
would this work in your case 
can you please also paste the bit above  exception message   
how did you stumble across this 
how about introducing the  null object pattern  https   medium com  franzejr null object pattern in ruby 12a809bc75cc  
does http   gist github com 591823 look ok 
can you point out where this is in a spec so that we can implement it correctly 
why are you still on rack 1 0 
why not write a middleware that corrects your headers    
what server are you using 
what exception should we raise  i think it can be fixed by setting  env "rack request cookie_string"   after the hash has been generated  thus not setting it when an exception is raised  
might need some more specifics  benchmarks  etc 
maybe you miss that  d0 is an invalid utf 8 character 
what are your using instead  could you give an example of this 
did you verify that rack  lint's error message is incorrect and your content length header matches the length of the response's body 
what is the actual exception  edit  nevermind  glad it works now   
however  there is an easy but   evil   fix you can do yourself 
what version are you running in which server 
how does the secret get into the env  anyway 
which handler are you using  handlers should be outputting headers "set cookie"    "foo nbar n baz" as three headers 
what is your ruby version 
what does this have to do with rack 
can you please provide your whole middleware stack 
why not make a pr 
what would you expect to happen 
would you mind sending a pr so we can see the diffs   if it's not too much work 
does this test reproduces your case  https   github com jodosha rack commit 416aade700d258581d58fb9c5046e0f86129c09e it passes for me but  according to your description  it supposed to fail 
does this still happen on master 
do fips compliant servers also remove checksum functions like crc32 or fnv 
maybe something's wrong w   page erb  
did you find other things that break   the thing you are probably trying to do can be achieved with   'server timing'    "app dur 100 ndb dur 60"   however  
can you make a pr 
where are you expecting content length header to come from  was there some implicit middleware before that is no longer present 
do you have time to make a pr  i'm currently up to my neck in bug hunting 
do you have a rack session object that responds to  to_hash  but does not return a hash  that violates rack's spec 
can you please submit a failing test or a minimal self contained example showing the error 
do you want to make a pr to start with 
can you post some code to reproduce this issue 
can you try this with master 
maybe by passing it to your connection handler and letting it keep track

can you post the urls py of your project  check that there is no strings in the url patterns 
do you get a javascript error in the console or somewhere  are the debug toolbar assets loaded correctly 
does it work if you move the  get_show_toolbar  import in  decorators py  inside  def inner  
do you want to send a pull request  i'd appreciate it 
which database are you referring to 
do you have a chance of profiling the panel to find out where the problem might be  no quick ideas unfortunately    
do you have more details about how to reproduce or a minimal example project 
what are the contents of  query  in your case 
do you have any idea what might be replacing  request post  with an incompatible data type 
maybe logging sql queries to the console is an option for you  https   avilpage com 2018 05 django tips tricks log sql queries to console html
do you have anything installed that might be impacting  pstats stats  
can you give us more details on what your test scenario  what action is resulting in a 400 
can you give me the full queryset that's problematic 
can you provide a test case that reproduces this issue 
what platform are you on  i tried it here and it seems to work ok 
what pyqt4  python  and os version are you using 
would it be okay if we removed fontui altogether and always use the system default  the fontdiff issue is interesting because we're using qfont tostring   and qfont fromstring   
do you have any tracebacks available 
can you just click into the commit message editor and start typing  i'm curious whether this is a pyqt bug because we don't have this problem 
do you happen to have an example file i can use for testing  i'll see what we can do 
can you share what you're naming the new remote 
do you have one  what are its contents  is it valid json  it might be at     config git cola settings      i'm not sure  the path changed at one point 
what version of cola  i recall fixing a similar issue quite recently  have you tried the latest master 
does that work better 
would  alt+ctrl+0  work  my coworker uses xmonad and i also noticed that the alt+# bindings were being trumped by his xmonad configuration  i'm certainly open to adjusting them 
what version are you using  works for me tm      you can do   and it'll show you the version 
what os are you on  does it happen for all repos  what happens after you hit the "refresh" button   ctrl+r 
can you try the latest version from the source tree and let me know if it's better there  i agree that what you describe is the desired behavior 
would that be helpful  or were you just curious 
what version  this seems like a repeat of #174 i actually use local overrides all the time  what platform are you on 
do share    got an  svg 
what terminal are you using   could it be that its mimedata url handling code is adding the newlines 
why should that check run on any commit other than an amend commit 
do you have a sense of the extent of the actions that would be needed  it seems like it boils down to one action   git deps  commit    correct 
maybe upgrade diff view to diff preview 
what version of git cola are you using  that code underwent a major overhaul in version 2 1 0  and it looks like you may be using an older version 
can you explain how to recreate this kind of setup  i'm sure we can make this work again 
what "path" did you enter  that config variable is the tool name  not a path  custom tools must be registered with git difftool  built in tools include meld  xxdiff  etc https   git scm com docs git difftool
can you please let me know if that's working for you 
what's the best way to convey that 
can you elaborate a bit 
shouldn't this kind of issues sent to the package's maintainer instead of the upstream 
can you check this is your case too 
can you provide the source code  a quick scan at the source code doesn't reveal the issue instantly   
do you think it's the same 
how do you see this work  add tests to fitnesse itself  or can we trigger dependent builds  should we move everything in one big repository 
what did the output  error log  say 
can you provide a little more context 
can this issue be closed 
how about open a pull request 
what do you mean by "remove a property tag from step"  you open a page  change the page properties  tools  properties   in a particular way so the properties xml becomes corrupt 
which version are you referring to 
can we close this issue 
did i miss anything 
can you provide steps to reproduce your situation 
what does "done" mean 
did you also set the permissions on the page properties screen 
do you by any change recall which fitnesse version that was 
what exactly are you missing 
did you have a particular situation where this failed  or was it an old java version you were running on 
do you have this also in your suite  i had no time to debug it but fixed it by moving the suite setup page to a different level 
what did you do to trigger this exception 
what does the   domainstep  annotation do  it is not part of fitnesse 
can you please add a description for this issue  what do you want to achieve 
when moving a user guide page  
could it be similar in any way to issue #995   the solution for multi byte chars is outlined there  it seems related to the version you mention 
must it not be class authenticator  kind regards six42
can you elaborate 
did it changed anything 
what are you trying tot accomplish  if  for example  you need certain system properties to change  it should be simple enough to do so from a fixture 
can you share the wiki content to reproduce this  i'm pretty sure i've seen this before with a table that was not properly formatted
can you elaborate what you are trying to achieve  maybe i can offer a workaround 
did you encounter any issue with this simplistic approach 
does fitnesse work as expected otherwise  does the test pass using an earlier release   i did run that test on macos before making the release and it was green  
can i ask why you need want to pass arguments this way  what are you trying to achieve 
could you double check if you're using the right url   without properties or edit in the parameters 
do you have any local changes  i don't recall having this problem locally and the  travis ci build  https   travis ci org fhoeben fitnesse jobs 653781665  is also green   
can i see the full trace  pass   t  to rake 
can you please post some code  either as a git repo or a gist  that reproduces this 
why was this closed  when was it fixed  was it not related to rake  i fixed by locking rake to 0 8 7 in my gemfile

can you paste the css as a gist  perhaps

did you figure this out 
what's your emacs version 
does that help      i'll add this info to the readme 
what are the emacs versions on the different machines  i've got a very recent emacs here 
should you perhaps be using  'default frame alist   rather than  'default frame  
did you file a bug report for the crash 
which version of emacs do you have 
would you mind confirming 
can you give me an example that i can reproduce  and which emacs version do you have   p s  i have noticed some quirks with  electric pair mode  myself

did you try restarting emacs  and or killing  not closing with  q   the  ibuffer  window  also  what vc backends are used by the buffers you currently have open 
what does the rest think 
what kind of files might you want to ignore when running  say   reek lib   reek will already only scan   rb  files 
which version of reek are you using 
doesn't this mean it's best to flag  all  shelling out as dangerous  that would make sense to me 
why dont you pull the if   else inside one format json call  thats what you should do in any case imho since it expresses your intention clearer 
can you try narrowing it down to a single file  or perhaps even just a small piece of code 
do you experience issues locating the source of the detected smells without the column 
can you try isolating the exact code that blows up   it seems  https   github com troessner reek blob v3 4 0 lib reek ast sexp_extensions rb#l198 l200  like an  attr  call with no arguments…
can you please post the destroy method as well  and what reek version 
does the problem go away if you remove the irresponsiblemodule bit 
do you gather usage statistics for the tool maintainer so we can see in what contexts and how reek was used 
can you try excluding just  devise  twofactorauthenticationcontroller   also  this detector should trigger on the _definition_ of the method  not on its _use_  i'm guessing  devise  twofactorauthenticationcontroller  is where it is defined 
what else do you need  an official release 
would this work in your case 
can you please also paste the bit above  exception message

how about introducing the  null object pattern  https   medium com  franzejr null object pattern in ruby 12a809bc75cc  
does http   gist github com 591823 look ok 
can you point out where this is in a spec so that we can implement it correctly 
why are you still on rack 1 0 
why not write a middleware that corrects your headers    
what server are you using 
what exception should we raise  i think it can be fixed by setting  env "rack request cookie_string"   after the hash has been generated  thus not setting it when an exception is raised  
might need some more specifics  benchmarks  etc 
maybe you miss that  d0 is an invalid utf 8 character 
what are your using instead  could you give an example of this 
did you verify that rack  lint's error message is incorrect and your content length header matches the length of the response's body 
what is the actual exception  edit  nevermind  glad it works now   
however  there is an easy but   evil   fix you can do yourself 
what version are you running in which server 
how does the secret get into the env  anyway 
which handler are you using  handlers should be outputting headers "set cookie"    "foo nbar n baz" as three headers 
what is your ruby version 
what does this have to do with rack 
can you please provide your whole middleware stack 
why not make a pr 
what would you expect to happen 
would you mind sending a pr so we can see the diffs   if it's not too much work 
does this test reproduces your case  https   github com jodosha rack commit 416aade700d258581d58fb9c5046e0f86129c09e it passes for me but  according to your description  it supposed to fail 
does this still happen on master 
do fips compliant servers also remove checksum functions like crc32 or fnv 
maybe something's wrong w   page erb  
did you find other things that break   the thing you are probably trying to do can be achieved with   'server timing'    "app dur 100 ndb dur 60"   however  
can you make a pr 
where are you expecting content length header to come from  was there some implicit middleware before that is no longer present 
do you have time to make a pr  i'm currently up to my neck in bug hunting 
do you have a rack session object that responds to  to_hash  but does not return a hash  that violates rack's spec 
can you please submit a failing test or a minimal self contained example showing the error 
do you want to make a pr to start with 
can you post some code to reproduce this issue 
can you try this with master 
maybe by passing it to your connection handler and letting it keep track

do you see log entry starting with "leader can currently not perform its duties"  https   github com akka akka blob release 2 3 akka cluster src main scala akka cluster clusterdaemon scala#l775 do you have other unreachable nodes at this point  which have not been downed 
can you open a pr  dispalt  
do you see any other negative consequences than that there can be holes in the used sequence numbers for the tagged events 
why is this a problem 
where does  java lang abstractmethoderror  wow  come from  do you use incompatible versions 
why not a range  
would you like to do the honors of creating a pull request with the fix 
would you be interested in hacking on this  cmbaxter and contributing 
which version of akka http have you used 
why would you ever send it on to another publisher  that would wrong  request should only come frome the stream that the publisher is connected to 
what do others think 
what cluster size  have you tried to reduce the gossip interval 
what kind of serialization format do you have in mind  and which  content type   
do you have an actual reproducer 
maybe a "make sure you have understood akka streams basics first  link to streams introduction " would be enough 
what os are you using 
do you have a reproducer maybe 
can you confirm this is on akka  http  2 4 2 and what you're using to issue the requests  something weird or simple curl  pasting it would help too  thanks

when you say the same node  you actually mean the same actorsystem right 
would it return a future 
does it make sense to you 
which api there is taking the duration as argument 
would you be able to help out by writing the zip one maybe  we should build a test that checks that all ops are documented there
could you in the meantime try on 2 4 7 
would you be able to submit a fixup pr  it's pretty easy  even via github ui  and you'll get credit for it     click here  https   github com akka akka edit master readme md
would you want to provide a pr with this change 
why not just use the file sink to stream directly the data to the file you want  it is much safer and likely faster 
why do you need the actor system  is if for creating worker actors  if so then perhaps support for creating actors would be more interesting than exposing the raw system 
can you provide us with a minimal reproducer 
does it always take that long  and do you see same in the jenkins logs https   jenkins akka io 8498 job akka multi node nightly    if that is the case we should increase the  expectedtestduration   pr is welcome 
do you have more examples of such streams 
do you also get replies from  ping 192 0 2 1   
could you prepare a full reproducer that'd be easier to verify with

would you be able to create a pr fixing this issue  martinmajor  
would you be able to create a pr fixing this 
which version are you seeing it in 
what is doing the weaving  does it work without whatever does the weaving 
would you want to give it ago

would you be up for trying out pr ing a fix 
what is your definition expectation of fast  have you profiled what is taking most time 
would you be able to contribute a fix 
would you be able to create a pull request 
would you be able to contribute with a pull request fixing the issue 
maybe we could build rsocket on top of akka tcp stream and then build streamref like thing on top of that 
what is difficult with the discuss forum  i think you need to be more specific in your question  what shared memory are you referring to  artery with the aeron transport 
which journal implementation are you using  do you know why event processing in the actor is slower than reads from the db 
do you have a way to reproduce it and would you be able to run with  akka loglevel debug  and share logs 
can you give some concrete use case when this operator is useful  if we decide we need it  we should probably avoid the allocation of two extra left right per element 
would that help in the situations where you ran into this limitation 
what would be your use case for having the generated documentation in a repo  would publishing a zip as discussed in #22728 be sufficient as well 
which test is that  both test cases spawn a  device  actor as far as i can see 
did you find an example in the docs or some code doing that 
can you describe the use case or is it just an inconsistency you have noted 
how do you implement "actors continiue handle messages until all nodes has seen the de registration"   i think this addition can make sense regardless 
do you think anything relevant is missing there 
do you think we would need to update things that _use_ jetty  e g   all of our http repo mocking infrastructure  
can you list the outstanding work on this issue  this makes it easier to pick this story up later 
what would this feature let us do  who would use it  why would they want to 
could you tell us what version of visual studio you are using as well as what windows sdk you are using  maybe including the  options txt  for either  compilehellosharedlibraryhellorc  or  compilehellostaticlibraryhellorc  
did this work in 4 8 or before 
can you please post the stacktrace for the npe you get 
what would be the concrete use case for this feature 
can you please update the milestone or merge today if it's good to go 
do you think  filecopydetails  like information could be passed to a filter  then the filter could decide if it needs to process the contents or not 
could you give us some concrete use case for configuring the  builddir  per component  that would help us with our planning 
could it be an issue with macos mojave 
do we have a stacktrace of the failure  i will start looking into it now 
can you provide some examples of where this might be useful  one i can think of is  project#project action project    
why do you want to share it  it'll just create contention between your builds  even if this specific issue was solved 
would you interested in providing a pull request for this feature 
can you give us a rough idea on which plugins are applied to the project and their order 
should be fixed by #865   could you try out the workaround  editing the wrapper script by hand  there 
what is this preventing you from achieving 
could you post an example of the broken script 
could you please provide a reproducible sample instead of just saying  create any test classes which fail  
could you confirm 
would https   docs gradle org nightly javadoc org gradle api plugins antlr antlrtask html#setarguments java util list  work  this is missing from the dsl docs  but it exists in the javadoc   melix is there anything else that's special about your plugin 
would you mind raising the issue there first 
would you be willing to address this 
can you please close the issue 
do you have a different example than the lifecycle tasks  assemble  check  build   the answer for that is to apply  org gradle lifecycle base  and do 
what are you trying to do 
should i create a separate ticket 
could you try out your project with a snapshot of the 4 3 1 release  https   downloads gradle org distributions snapshots gradle 4 3 1 20171107130851+0000 bin zip
would that solve all  some  or none of your goals 
how did you get a hold of that  the return type of  defaulttask getproject    should be  project  and not  projectinternal   please try to use the public api whenever possible 
do you happen to have the build cache enabled 
does it still exist 
can you give us an example of tests that are run in addition to the ones you expect  maybe a small example project on github 
would you mind running    gradlew dependencies  on the command line and see if one of your dependencies is marked with  failed  
could you please open a separate issue for it including a reproducible example 
could you open an issue there 
could you verify that maven resolves to version 7 4 0 for this use case 
what's the version you upgraded _from_  you might have just hit  groovy 7402  https   issues apache org jira browse groovy 7402  or a related issue 
can you provide the source for com successfactors buildsystem webmodule js directiveparsertask  or at least the method  directiveparsertask processfiles    
could you share  build scans  https   scans gradle com   for before after the switch  thanks 
can you explain why you would believe this to be a gradle issue 
did you try gradle 3 3 or 3 4 rc 1  too  i think there shouldn't be any changes in behavior 
would you mind raising an issue with circleci  the issue seems to be rather a limitation on their end 
do you mean version 3 5 here  you mention 3 15 above 
maybe you would like submitting an accompanying pr to fix it 
could you show me an example project on github 
would you be interested in providing a pull request to fix the issue 
how  do you have a stack trace from android studio  what version of android studio 
did you enable incremental compile 
would you mind checking if the issue also occurs with 3 3  any "somewhat" reproducible sample project would help tremendously 
does your example project above exhibit this behavior in some way 
can you please provide a reproducible example project  also you might want to use a  composite build  https   docs gradle org current userguide composite_builds html  instead of manually adjusting eclipse  classpath files 
what's the result of running  gradle dependencies  from the command line 
do you have any information for  blackdrag here 
could you please push a reproducible example to github  that would make it easier for us to fix the problem 
how do you do that  mostly likely with something like  project tasks withtype           configure    or  project plugins withtype           configure     can you elaborate on your use case 
could you tell us about your environment  gradle version  os  etc  as well  build scan preferred  
what happens when you run    gradlew  i  home  gradle init d fail gradle  
can you elaborate why this issue is specific to the use of cucumber  is there a way to reproduce the issue without cucumber 
can you think of any particular interaction or thing about your project that might make this issue distinct from others 
does this mean that you cannot use gradle at all because your organization does not allow requests with the default user agent 
why do you depend on  mavenlocal     gradle uses its own cache 
why do you want to add something manually  you can define everything you need in your build script 
which version of gradle were you using before 
when a task is not up to date and its output is used downstream 
would the message be enough or do you need the full stacktrace 
could you please describe the actual use case 
do you see the same issue with 3 4 
do you have a little more detail on where how    extension targettests getorelseget extension targetclasses   is used 
why do you need that as part of the inputs 
would you be interested in looking into a fix 
do you think you could provide us with a reproducible sample 
could you help us out and narrow the version range for us to search for the regression  could you also link  build scans  https   gradle com scans get started  for both of your steps to reproduce 
can you please provide a sample project that reproduces the issue  the sample project can simply publish to a local repository 
does that make sense 
would you mind providing us with a  ascii screencast  https   asciinema org   
does the behavior improve if you try v4 0 m2  can you also tell me more about your build environment  os  project type  android webapp java   etc 
would you mind raising an issue with the  buildship project  https   github com eclipse buildship   you question is much better suited to be handled over there  thanks 
what exactly are you trying to achieve in  groovycheck     i am sure we'll find a different option that doesn't involve groovy meta programming 
where is the plugin hosted you are trying to download 
could you consider sending a  build scan  https   gradle com build scans  
could you please provide a sample project that demonstrates the issue 
would you mind providing a sample project  also which java 10 version are you using 
maybe we can address this in conjunction with #5079 
could you provide an example what you mean by "deep search" and how that is different between the two annotations 
would you be interested in submitting a pr for this 
can you please include the error you are seeing 
does this happen every time  could you provide a thread dump for the daemon when it's hung  thanks 
when you have a chance  can you give it a try and confirm that it fixes the problem you were seeing 
what is your use case  why not make that property an   outputfile   since it _is_ an output of the task  
do you have some examples of what you were trying to do 
do you have a fuller example  that looks like  https   github com masonamerica mason apps build system git  is producing the plugin  mason apps  and you're applying it to itself 
can you please attach a small example project showing the problem 
do you see more information if you run with   s  or   i  
which version of the jdk is this  i'm guessing it's jdk8  has this only been happening on ci or does it happen locally for some developers 
would you be interested in providing a pull request for this 
could you provide a reproducible example please 
does it work with gradle 4 6 
did you have a look at that

would you be interested in looking into providing a pull request 
could you please raise the issue with them  feel free to report back if you can't get an answer there 
can you please provide a reproducible example project  as far as i remember these locale issues were fixed in recent gradle versions 
does the problem still occur with the final 4 1 release 
does that make sense  now to understand better the relationships between configurations  i am interested in knowing the full  extends  hierarchy of both configurations named above 
could you please provide a simplistic build script that demonstrates the issue 
could you please attach a zipped up example project  including gradle wrapper  sample files     so we can reproduce this as quickly as possible 
can you confirm it's ok for me to do this 
don't you want to verify that specific task actions actually run 
does it work if you exclude your custom  archives   configuration from the plugin project 
does gradle fail the upload task or is it emitted as a warning  normally if the repository doesn't support sha512 we continue 
could you please give us more context

would you be interested in contributing a fix 
can you please add the gradle version and whether this is transient or permanent  also what you would expect gradle to do 
what happens if you specify a classifier and run the build multiple times  this might be the same issue from https   github com spring projects spring boot issues 1113
can you please provide a screenshot to see what you mean by "nothing happens" 
maybe using   1 2   instead of   1 0 0 2    and   2 3   instead of   2 0 0 3    would work for both maven and gradle 
can you try 6 1 rc1 and confirm that it fixes the issue for you

did you by any chance configure something that could explain that 
did it ever worked in previous gradle version 
does your project contain source code  if not there's nothing to build  so nothing to publish

can you open your export file and see of the characters are at least in the export 
would it make sense to use a jquery popup for the message instance  that way you don't have to worry about targeting back to the referrer 
what version of vanilla 1 were you using 
can you give me steps to reliably trigger the issue

what happens after that

does your suggested change work 
do you see the exact same error in the logs 
what file are you importing  it appears to be an html file  given that error 
do you have any suggestions for how to accomplish this reliably  there's a hacky  rewrite_closing_parens  method in the lexer at the moment  but it isn't at all safe 
could you have done it with just a variable and a  while  
could be incorporated by not    that might be an option 
shouldn't this be symmetric to your proposed exponential symbol  the nth root  or something like that 
where does this need to be changed 
how about  code    code  then  by itself it has no meaning         x    1  2  3   code    code  also makes sense 
what context are you using it within  compiling it by itself on trycoffee org seems fine 
why not just use an object to represent the environment  env   server  debug 
does that answer your question 
how would those suggested changes make it more useful for real projects  how is it making it simpler 
what version of cs are you running 
did you mean to use   cw      compile   watch   instead 
what does that do

why would the code i posted throw an error in an older cs translator 
does that answer your question 
do you think that's better 
can you explain what you might like to see  
can we add an event listener for an event that fires when an element is added to the dom  if not  it doesn't look like we can implement this 
what about just using commas 
can you give a suggested compilation for the sample code in your original post 
can you paste the complete example of the problem 
how should we use them from  package json   and or the install script 
what happens if you try to dereference  array new   or assign to it  the abstraction falls apart pretty quickly 
does that not work for you 
doesn’t  hover      hoverin          hoverout      do what you want  except that it leaves some unnecessary parentheses around the functions 
could you give a concrete example 
what's the specific problem you're trying to solve 
can you elaborate  when you use  require  from inside a cs file  it's just using  node 's  require  
would you care to elaborate 
does it work if you remove the  catch  clause altogether  try return new window xmlhttprequest  
can someone produce a test that proves that this pattern doesn't break  instanceof  through prototype chains  for previously extended classes 
maybe hop on #coffeescript on irc freenode net and talk with him about it 
could you give an example of exactly what you're proposing  in terms of either javascript output or the existing coffeescript this new keyword would replace 
what about a function  near 0 1 + 0 2  0 3
do you want to give a suggested compilation 
did you read the previous related issues  #834 #853 #1087 #1092 #1283
does that help  if not  can you try to make your question a little more clear and or generic 
can we see an expected compilation or two 
what is the observed behaviour 
did you remember to add npm into your path  execute this command        and paste the results here   
do you have have any reasons other than copying perl and c#  because that's not a very good reason to change what is now established as standard coffeescript 
can you give a more concrete test case 
which version of coffeescript are you using 
what debugger are you using  the ones i'm aware of work fine without the functions being named  they get the name from context 
would you suggest do implement the       _left fat arrow_  for context bound continuations as well 
what's your code 
can you paste the errant output and the input that generated it 
who is doing that 
what would that go up to  infinity  javascript  and hence coffeescript  has exclusively strict semantics  so no infinite collections 
can you think of use cases outside of templating that this functionality could be used for 
what's the point of targeting llvm 
what are the outputs of  node   version  and  coffee   version

what does  michaelficarra think 
what kind of information would you want that to output  the same as  cake  alone

when will  code window  code  be array like  are you attempting to use  code of  code  
what else would you expect the compiler to do when given an invalid program 
what made you assume that the js you say you expected should have been produced 
did you not include the script that adds it  this appears to have nothing to do with coffeescript  so closing for now 
what behavior do you observe when running  coffee  w   the   coffee  files run once  but new files don't run and modified files don't re run 
how is coffeescript supposed to know you're performing an assertion  this issue is more appropriate for  the node repo  https   github com joyent node   assuming you are using their assertion library   closing as  invalid  
did you search for prior issues  see #1165  many others 
what's your suggested compilation 
can you go into why it's so necessary not to generate the comment 
did you try it  works just fine  http   coffeescript org #try do 20 a 2c 20b  20  3e
why not refactor the deeply nested codes into a function and then call the function 
what exactly does that gem provide 
why the heck would someone assign var to itself 
would you expect  to compile  of course not 
can you give some more concrete examples where json3 uses shadowing that is difficult to convert to cs 
do browsers even support that 
what is the raw javascript you would write to do the same thing 
what's the error you're getting  
what's wrong with  r i    0 for v  i in r when not v  
can you give specific examples of constructs that you'd like to compile differently 
what happens in the case of an inner callback like you said   what's wrong with async js and stuff  
maybe it's worth reconsidering 
what for 
would that make sense 
what flag is _not_ working for you 
what are the consequences of it reporting the wrong version number  it shouldn't be a very big deal 
what command did you type to cause this 
don't you think so 
do you think this is a common use case enough to have a dedicated syntax for it  
what's your node version 
what _exactly_ is the problem you're seeing here 
can you give a bit more information   can you double check grunt coffee is using 1 6 3  
what would the diff in compilation output look like 
could you include the code as javascript between backticks 
can you confirm that this bug exists on jashkenas coffee script master as well 
would you disallow   n  then and just keep everything as is 
how is this supposed to be parsed 
what's wrong with super  then   this works  
why open a ticket just to refer to another ticket  we can take a look at #3813 directly 
how would you guess the variable name then  
why didn’t you try the latest version 
maybe you could try  coffee react  https   github com jsdf coffee react    i've barely googled  but i think there are better solutions that just backticks everywhere 
how about starting with a link + description for the "examples" list 
why do you need an operator 
when would someone want to  math ceil a   b   
can you investigate the nature of the errors 
maybe produce a list of filenames we're going to generate  and if there are any dupes  error out early 
how about this    where     reads like "function returning undefined"  
how about with the latest version of io js  and the latest  1 9  version of coffeescript 
what's the realistic use case 
how close are we to publishing a 1 9 1  to get this fix in 
do all of the runtimes that support generators also support es2015's  for of  
what linter do you use 
how is that an issue 
do you have a mac  i tried it with windows 7 recently  and that was pretty bad 
what is it trying to do  exactly 
could you explicit the issue a bit 
do you have a difference of the compiled code before after  seems a bit surprising 
why should it  none of these loop had any iteration  because of the  when    so how'd the value change 
what if you don't use execjs  and just install nodejs   what's your code 
did you try it out or just look at the code 
why not just define a function "keys" and "values" 
do you care to submit a pull request 
how much flexibility is there  if any  as to where the comments can appear 
why  is  await promise all  too long 
what's your coffeescript version 
can you try this on the  ast  branch  we refactored comments in jsx on that branch  i wonder if it’s any different 
why do you want to preserve the empty lines  just out of interest  
can you find an example that doesn’t involve another library 
may you please confirm  thanks 
maybe you used to think that punsubscribe would emit a message for every matching channel 
maybe poll   in aewait should check more events like pollpri pollerr 
what are you using in what os 
could you post new issues there  if they occur  thanks 
what can we express with yaml that we cannot express right now 
why     they're properly ignored   gitignore   won't be installed and doesn't break any known convention
can you post the full bug report from the start mark up to and including the end mark  thanks 
why not  please provide more information 
what is the problem here 
what kind of subscriptions do your clients have  and how many messages are you pushing through redis

do you want to return value is 30 or remove expire option  i don't know what do you want 
what do you see as error in the _slave_ side  thank you 
what operating system  can i get shell access for 10 minutes  thank you  salvatore
could you please try to run it again  i think you executed the wrong executable  because i see 2 9 5 in version  that is actually the unstable branch  cheers
can you force a full recompile via  make distclean   jemalloc was recently updated  and you could be mixing up versions 
can you please describe the sequence of operations leading to the bug  i'm working on it more btw  thanks 
maybe it's about redis rb or other client lib  closing  thanks 
what's redis version  same issue https   github com antirez redis issues 290 and fixed it  thank you 
did you tried if 3gb fixes it  thanks 
when did you download redis 2 6 0 stable  maybe i think you downloaded 2 6 0 rc8  it is same symptom when i downloaded 2 6 0 rc8  try to download 2 6 0 in redis io 
could you please provide a copy of the file  thanks 
did you performed a memory test in this box  is the output really truncated to "client list output" and there is nothing more  thanks  salvatore
does redis start if you try it manually  does it start when removing the rdb file  or moving it somewhere else  
why are you subscribing so late in the process  subscribe when the batch is created 
did you tried a memory test possibly just with   redis server   test memory  was the box near the memory limits when this happened  thanks 
does this even matter  you're supposed to install the binary   try  make install   also  'most other software' lacks source 
can you look if you got the complete one 
may we turn this into a request for doc 
which version of redis are you using  the return value changed in recent versions to the  1  2 semantics  so it seems you're still using an old version 
might be a typo  but is that supposed to be 6379 instead of 6369 
can you share configuration of redis and host machine 
could you run a full memory test to see if your ram is corrupt 
how can i share it  
can you provide a dump rdb  does it crash without valgrind 
can you submit a pull request to https   github com antirez redis doc please  thanks 
could you please share the test code  and maybe the client 
can you please provide a pull request to antirez redis doc  thank you 
could you pleas provide the config  how much memory does your machine have 
what is the terminal program you are using  thanks 
how did you get the source  can you try a  make distclean  make  again 
can you give more details about the machine and redis version that you're running  br 
what are the versions of your servers    info server  output  
can you post the full crash log  otherwise we can only guess what happened and this won't bring us anywhere
what flags were set during compiling 
did you run  check  while the cluster was still being configured  it would help if you had some output from the tools or more details about your cluster setup 
how much free memory  from your report  it looks like your request   keys link     just asked for too much memory and died 
may i ask why you closed this  sentinel should definitely not crash like that 
does this pop up constantly 
what's your value for repl ping slave period   default 10  post redis version too  because maybe you are affected by already fixed bug 
what version are you trying to compile 
can you provide the full log from both sentinels  btw  you should better run atleast 3 sentinels 
do you set maxmemory in redis conf 
could not connect to redis at 127 0 0 1 6379  connection refused 1      redis server       redis cli ping  echo    pong 0    
can you describe everything you're running  provide any other logs  also see related issues  https   github com antirez redis search q failover abort no good slave type issues utf8  e2 9c 93
did you try it 
did you try polling all your instances to get their cluster nodes during and after the resharding to see if anything strange shows up 
what to do in order to make it simpler  you can also use  redis trib  to do so  and it will care about sending the command itself 
can u provide redis conf  
might this be related to #2612  is one instance explicitely bound to an interface that can't reach the other instance 
which version of redis are you using  from what i see in the code there shouldn't be the possibility that  rpush  returns  0  at all 
could you maybe just give some coordinates  would make it much easier to just test it    
why don't just set a very high node timeout  it's the same basically 
what about  make malloc libc  instead 
where's the problem with simply sending get and ttl in a transaction or using lua for this 
could you kindly provide the steps you use so i can try to reproduce this  thanks

can you add a specific formatter to the existing function 
did you make sure you don't have any bogus  nodes conf  in the directory your starting redis from

what way you do this benchmark  with you own  code  or  redis benchmark   
can all nodes actually talk to each other on port 6379 as well as 16379

does anyone have any suggestions or solutions 
what did you do  2  what is happening  3  what did you expect to happen

might i ask why you are doing this manually instead of using  send   with that you could just do   https   www npmjs com package send
can you share what version of express you are using and how to reproduce that message so we can track where it is coming from

what's the success criteria of this issue  changing the coding guideline  https   github com sbt website blob 1 x src reference 90 developers guide 02 coding guideline 00 md
what is your expected outcome  a better documentation on our part or automatic detection of sbt upgrade and cleaning 
do you mean sbt itself should depend on sources javadoc for dependencies or that it should make projects do that by default   also  i believe you'd need  sources  sources   
do you have a repro project or an example in the wild 
how about   d  to exit  another thing is that even when   c  is supposed to cancel current task  but stay in the sbt shell  it doesn't really work

can you try 0 13 5 m2 and see if that fixes the issue  thanks

what operating system are you using  what sbt launcher are you using  for example how did you install it

would you like to send us a pull request to sbt website 
how would this work with task aggregation across the subprojects  should a test or compilation failure stop the execution of all tests compilation

what difference are you seeing 
can you point me to the rules by which vim does the indenting here  preferrably through a  help command

which version of vsvim were you using  i remember that issue popping up a while back and fixing it for a recent release 
what version of vsvim are you using  what type of keyboard layout do you have 
which of the particular issues are you seeing 
do you have any other plugins installed 
would it be possible to send me a bit of sample text and the initial position of the cursor which will repro this problem 
can you try escaping the character you're referring to  github markup is escaping the character and i can't see it 
do you have repro scenario for this  i've tried a couple of different ways and can't seem to get this to repro locally 
do you have specific steps that can produce that 
what's differing for you 
can you point me to a help page for why  ctrl q  m  works here  i dug through   help cmdline mode  but couldn't find anything 
can you give me more details on what type of search you want to do with tags that won't work with visual studio 
could you explain a bit more 
do you know if this behavior is tied to any vim setting or is it just unconditionally done 
what are you seeing as a behavior difference between these two  when i do this i see the same behavior for the 2 operations 
what version of vsvim are you using  that was implemented in 0 9 4 
what behavior are you expecting here  it seems to be a search for "and" and replace with "andvor" as typed  this works as i would expect in vsvim 0 9 5 1
do you have r# running on your box 
do you see anything different about the setups that may point to the difference in repro 
what issues in particular are you having with coderush  i've never actually used it so it's hard to know what's a bug and what's not when picking it up 
which version of visual assist are you using 
can you elaborate a little more on what you are seeing here  from the description it's really hard for me to understand what you are seeing go wrong

do you have any special caret   mouse blink settings set on windows 
what behavior were you expecting here

what is your setting for 'selection'  
what version of visual studio are you using  do you only have visual studio 11 installed on the machine 
what version of vsvim are you using 
which version of vsvim are you using  this was definitely a problem with 1 2 0 but i just released a new version yesterday morning  1 2 1  which should've addressed issues like this 
do you have  set hlsearch  enabled  this is a feature that's definitely supported  i use it on all my machine  
could you try giving me a short sample 
what behavior do you see when it doesn't work 
what file types are you editting when you see it change 
could you run   set  in gvim and post the output here 
do you have any other extensions installed on that machine 
do you have any other plugins installed 
can you post the contents of your vimrc file 
can you elaborate a bit more on what you were seeing here 
could you post your vimrc file so i could take a quick look 
could you post your _vimrc file contents if you have one loaded  note  if you just save with  ctrl s  does that cause the intent to happen as well 
when you say you suspended r# did you uninstall it or just disable the plugin  vsvim will still do a bit of extra work even if r# is disabled

can you post the actual text snippet of the  vimrc instead of the picture  want to make sure i have the exact text here to look at 
how is this version different

why not just use   data  
can you please explain in a different way what you are doing exactly  what you expected  and what you observe  preferably including some code  configuration details  version numbers etc 
what is your java version  hopefully this is not an issue for java    10  but for java 6 9  pretty much it is 
do you think of a better way to distinguish configuration keys from annotation methods in the documentation 
would this be for fields  or parameters  or both  or    
can you at least give an example if the code you would like to be generated and how that would look in your proposal 
can you give this a try and report back 
did you add the lombok maven dependency in your pom 
could it be that it's the raw types 
what compiler do you use  eclipse or javac or mvn 
can you please continue this conversation in the previous issue #1139  
can you give a code example of with and without your annotation 
can you test this 
what code would you have them generate that they don't generate already 
can you give that one a try 
can you configure errorprone to use jdk8 instead  or use the lombok jar from the  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge html  
do you really mean   tostring exclude   "myproperty1  myproperty2"    or is it a "mental typo" and you mean   tostring exclude    "myproperty1"  "myproperty2"      the former is wrong 
can you try the  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge html  
can you test this using the  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge  
what resolution exactly  what os  i tested on windows 10 with 3840 × 2160 and it was fine 
could you provide a minimal executable demo   nimo23
what's your java  lombok and and ide versions 
did you use an older version of lombok 
can you test this using the  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge   although not mentioned in the changelog  we did improve gradle support 
what version of lombok are you using  what's the source code  do you have a module info java 
which lombok version  which java version  are you using something like gradle  could you put a full class  including package and imports statements and everything else 
maybe the best way is not to fork it but help contribute to that project  i'm sure the plugin would appreciate a pull request or 2 
could you try 
could you elaborate 
can you add the whole file that produces this problem  i can't understand what or where is your  atomicreference calculated  
what happens with 1 18 0 
can you switch it off 
why  often you use builders in combination with immutable classes  these should never get a   noargsconstructor  
can you try to assign the result of the build method to a local variable first 
why isn't   builder tobuilder true   sufficient  with that  you can do this  var newinstance   oldinstance tobuilder   attribute 1  build    or use   wither  
can you supply actual pom files to explain what you mean 
do you want to invoke  delombok  programmatically 
can you give a link to something we can clone 
can you explain how this is a lombok related question 
can you give us the simplest complete  pom xml  file that reproduces your problem 
does this also happen when compiling directly with  javac  or with maven 
can you please verify it in a soon to be released  edge release  https   projectlombok org download edge  
can you verify the version of lombok used by your eclipse by opening _help_    _about eclipse sdk_ and scrolling the top right credits area down    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 93318 57252221 f104ea00 704b 11e9 8dc8 f57ffccb4523 png 
why is the dependency marked as optional  it is not at https   projectlombok org setup maven
why would you want this  to what would you change that 
do i understand that this is a regression  what version of lombok or jdk did it work last 
can you please provide a complete minimal java example to reproduce the problem 
can you please submit the minimal source code that triggers this error 
did you try other java versions 
what do you expect 
what happens if you use   lombok with  instead of   lombok experimental wither  
wouldn't it make more sense to ask parasoft jtest to allow for configurable generated annotations  it is possible to instruct delombok to insert   javax annotation generated  
why not taking the opposite direction  define your fields in the class and the use   fieldnameconstants asenum   true   to generate your enum 
do you have a specific case that does not work with that 
why not use that 
does  fileprocessentity  also has   superbuilder   if not  add it  otherwise please post the compiler error  also give details and versions of your setup  lombok version  maven  gradle  eclipse  intellij       
what have i done implementing this generics hell    
can you try adding  static  keyword to the nested class  if it starts working  then it is the same issue as https   github com rzwitserloot lombok issues 2369
does it act differently  for example throw an exception  when you do not use jquery and instead use direct dom operations 
can you provide a test case  all i see is two issues opened with a question but no evidence 
where do these error logs come from  is the only thing they give that list you've mentioned  is it a stack trace 
what is it that needs to be changed  note that the repo has a license file 
what would you expect jquery to do here 
can you test with http   code jquery com jquery git2 js and see if that fixes the problem  we've switched to using  requestanimationframe  for the next release and that may affect  improve   the results 
how did you get that call  the  docs  http   api jquery com jquery each   are pretty clear that arg should either be an array or an object  and a primitive string is not one of those 
did this work in 2 1 1 and break with 2 1 3  do you have a complete test case  you mention grunt contrib uglify  are you building your own copy 
would you like to file a pr 
could you create a test case that works completely on jsfiddle or jsbin without relying on a specific external site  on which browser do you experience the problem 
would you like to send us pr for both 
could you please post the link with the jquery code that shows the bug 
could you create a jsfiddle example  or even try it with native xhr

what are you trying to accomplish  modifying the contents of an element during the mouseenter leave itself is pretty dicey  note this clarification on your fiddle  http   jsfiddle net 4res6aey 16 
can you find one 
can you provide a demonstration  it seems to be working for me  http   jsfiddle net s2kqg1g9 
could you post a concrete example  preferrably on jsbin  it's hard to guess what you have in mind when you're not sharing the code   
why do you think that  is it documented in http   api jquery com each  for example 
can't you just use   serialize    or   serializearray     i'm not sure why the stackoverflow answer is creating a form element in the first place 
could you post a link to the issue here  some people will be interested   
what happens if you use http   code jquery com jquery git1 js 
can you provide a test case on jsbin com or jsfiddle net showing what you mean 
how are you installing jquery 
what's your opinion    i'm afraid my expressions may be rude or hard to read  because i'm not so good at english  thanks 
could you report an issue at https   github com jquery api jquery com issues   this is documentation issue  not code issue 
can you post a code example at jsbin com perhaps 
can you please provide us more details about the code that is causing the issue  for example  can you reproduce it using  jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net   or  js bin  http   jsbin com  html css output  
did the response return valid json 
what do you mean by ie8 emulation mode  ie8 mode in ie11  we don't support document modes other than the latest in each browser 
what do others think 
wouldn't the code below do the same and be more readable without using unnamed arguments 
do you have an example where this is failing 
can you provide a complete example 
can you provide a reduced test case  e g   without polymer  against the  git build  http   code jquery com jquery git js   preferably somewhere like  js bin  http   jsbin com   so it's easy for us to tinker with it 
what would that value be if no elements were animated  if you need a completion for the entire animation  look into   promise     http   jsbin com kevorosapu edit html js output
could you provide a test case on jsfiddle or jsbin 
why can't you use require  an environment that has  module exports  but that doesn't allow you to use  require  sounds broken to me   
do we want to patch it 
can you upgrade jsdom   try again 
can you provide a pull request 
what if someone wanted the value of a checkbox element the way they get it today 
can you link to the tinymce bug report for this 
do you need the animation module  if not you could build a custom jquery without the modules it is complaining about 
can you clarify which case you consider to be the "problem" with an example on jsbin com or jsfiddle net 
how does it help your code to have  "timeout"  reported 
can you simplify it a bit 
do you perhaps use some external libraries that still use those parameters  could you provide a test case at https   jsfiddle net or https   jsbin com 
can you move this example to jsbin com or jsfiddle net 
why are you passing nested arrays  and what did you expect it to do 
maybe  mikesherov  
can you put one together  the reason this "regression" occurred is that  we don't support svg  https   contribute jquery org wont fix #svg vml or namespaced elements bugs  in general  so if there's no test it's likely to break 
how did you run into this  jakecigar  was it reported on the forums 
could you construct a minimal project example that exhibits the problem and share it  ## michał gołębiowski

could you make sure it's correct and or provide more info 
can you provide some more information  the issue template had a lot of questions that would be useful to answer 
can you provide a complete test case 
what browser and what version of jquery 
would you like to work on this   mbest 
did you only test chrome  what does it do on firefox  edge  or safari 
could you be more precise in your request 
why must it  who calls the shots  on what basis 
could you create a test case without external libraries on https   jsfiddle net or https   jsbin com 
where did you set the timeout  i have a feeling that a complete example might show some other cause 
does it only occur when jquery manipulates the page  or does it happen with standard dom calls as well 
what browser 
why does that matter  the end result is exactly the same  also  your  +  example is just the existing   add    method 
did you read the issue template  it asked for a test case  with such a short report there's nothing we can do 
can you provide a test case 
however  could you reduce the test case  it's a bit large  a smaller test case would help us understand the issue  thanks 
what is the benefit of using fetch  when this feature is done  how will the code work better 
does the problem occur if jquery is not on the page  what led you to conclude jquery was the cause 
would you like to file a pull request 
did you mean qunit

how do you run the code you mentioned from node js  we need more details 
can you provide a test case on  js bin  https   jsbin com qawicop edit html css js output  as the issue template requested  thanks 
would you have a simple way to reproduce this 
do you have a stack trace  
do you have a sample code that reproduce the issue 
does it leak 
does this still happen with the very last version of the library 
did you import  uiimageview+webcache h

could you try again tomorrow and check if the issue is still there  i'm suspecting this has to do with a broken amazon gh server  and is a transient problem 
what version are you running on 
maybe we should wait as long as winxp is supported by oraclejdk clojure leiningen

which version of jspdf are you using  in theory  it's impossible that this error is thrown  because  convertbase64tobinarystring  in the addimage plugin is always called with  throwerrors   false  
which version of jspdf are you using 
doesn't the original get uninstalled when this happens and thus makes the script id unique 
what is the use case for this

how is pbm related to greasemonkey  what should we change 
what version of greasemonkey  i assume you're referring to the replacement for the "explore add ons" message added in a9e37a304a08798a19c3b78e3982599e47bbefe1 which is newer than 0 9 2 and fixed in 5d9f4238319d075fa53ddd08de8d1bb2bf862869  
can you provide a reference for this statement  what does "not supported" mean 
could you provide more details  operating system  firefox version  greasemonkey version  could you test in a fresh profile  see  http   wiki greasespot net greasemonkey_manual getting_help#what_to_say
can you provide an exact example of both which script  including source url  and which page the error happens on 
does your addons window look like that shown here  http   www greasespot net 2010 11 greasemonkey 090 release html
what causes this  http   wiki greasespot net greasemonkey_manual getting_help#what_to_say
which   storage  is  intentionally  available  and cross origin 
would it make sense to set the user agent header for all requests that the extension  rather than the browser itself  makes 
why not  what is the practical difference 
can you provide a reduced test case  my standard testing script   https   gist github com arantius 1157543   works as expected 
how do you "loads an external script" and what is the failure mode 
maybe it would be a good idea on focus if the addons manager is open  and when it is opened  that still wouldn't be perfect  but it would be closer 
does anything show in the error console 
do you see a similar message in the error console 
do you think we would knowingly intentionally break that  moreover  it's beta  we're looking for constructive feedback on work that isn't complete  can you provide some more details  http   wiki greasespot net troubleshooting_ users 
maybe it would be better to make right and left click on the icon both open the menu  that's what adblock plus does  for example 
can you provide a specific script  the smaller the better  and a specific page 
what does the phrase "it won't return" refer to  focus 
can you help me understand your use case  why do you need to enable disable many scripts  why do you need to do so frequently 
why would you want this 
when you right click on one script  when you wrench drop down check for updates  both  something else 
can you clarify what exactly you mean when you mention a selection box which is blank 
what os  which file  what is its full path  all the rest of the details requested at http   wiki greasespot net greasemonkey_manual getting_help#what_to_say  
did you wrap the code in function  i've similar script work well
does this happen in greasemonkey 1 x on a current version of firefox  development on older versions of either is extremely unlikely to happen 
what's the broken behavior 
what scripts do you have installed 
why can't you write everything in the obvious direct manner 
what does the java plugin look like  do you have a screenshot handy  i don't have it installed and don't want it 
what site  what script  exactly 
how about with gm 3 8beta2  https   addons mozilla org en us firefox addon greasemonkey versions  page 1#version 3 8beta2
what does "add to default metablock" mean  and there's been no  greasemonkey jar  for quite a long time 
what do you mean with "cannot be canceled"  an ajax call can never be canceled  if you want to make sure  it does not run forever  give it a timeout 
what does this have to do with greasemonkey  i don't even really know what problem you're trying to describe 
what are your specs  looks like a custom theme or addon  that delete button doesn't look standard   mozilla 5 0  windows nt 6 1  wow64  rv 32 0  gecko 20100101 firefox 32 0 
can you be more specific  i can't understand how "takes too long" can explain "doesn't load in certain tabs "
can you provide a complete standalone script that exhibits this behavior without depending on the contents of the page it is executed on 
how often do you need to "edit multiple scripts" 
what version of greasemonkey are you running  have you recently  re installed or edited the script in question 
can you test this with the most recent  nightly build  https   arantius com misc gm nightly     if the script works there  then the fix is already in the works for v2 1
can you provide an exact script that behaves incorrectly  preferably at http   gist github com   
why  i have a hard time imagining how adding this can be an improvement for anybody 
what do you mean by override  adding   important  for each style attribute  i'm using stylish  but have to add it everywhere

can u try with latest edge  i fixed a similar problem  now our bins handle bundler correctly 
do you have any recommendations 
what page 
do you have other translations files in your project 
can you confirm  thanks 
can you try padrino edge  not going to lie no idea what would be causing the infinite regression of  name haha  perhaps the reloader problem from 0 10 6 
can you try with    root   plop   
what was your desired result 
does this happen in padrino edge or 0 12 0 rc2  this may have been fixed 
what do you think 
which version of ruby are you on 
do you mean that 
what is the opinion about this from other padrino core members like  achiu   daddye   namusyaka   nesquena   ortuna   skade and  ujifgc

does the commit do what you wanted 
could you upload that test project somewhere  i did the same and can't seem to hit that issue      cc  namusyaka
could you try  asset_path nil  'path to asset'   ans tell if that's what you want 
could you check if https   github com padrino padrino framework commit 7b456e0873cd5b032d3dede618f5808cd0d6f2a8 solves the problem for you

could you try running the capybara specs and see if those run on your system 
does this break when used with the current stable version of celerity  if it doesn't  then there's no harm in adding that extra call  imho 
maybe this is something that should be fixed in launchy instead 
what do you think 
maybe i'm not understanding your problem correctly  if you could provide a failing spec  that would make it much easier to diagnose 
could you do a fork and pull request  i hate applying patches   
why  1 9 3 is superior in every conceivable way and highly compatible  am i missing something 
would you mind giving an example of the usage in features support   see above 
may be related to #81  
did you by chance include capybara in the global namespace 
why would it matter what font you are using in your tests 
what is the complete definition if the step you used  seems like it cannot find the scope or the element change picture in this scope   
could you try seeing if you get the same problem using just plain webdriver or if the problem seems to be related to capybara 
maybe it's just a misconception you have about capybara  if you can provide some insight  maybe we can tweak that text so it doesn't confuse people in the future 
could you try if this is still the case with the latest selenium webdriver  if it is  we should probably file an issue with them 
which version of capybara are you using  we saw this bug in capybara before 0 4 0 was tagged  it shouldn't have happened since 
do you think you can provide a patch 
can you dig a little more and pinpoint the cause  i've reopened this for now 
could that be your problem 
what do you mean it runs fine  you need to actually switch to the selenium driver for it to be used  you probably want to set capybara current_driver  and not capybara javascript_driver 
maybe you have something else called xpath loaded  do a  p xpath  at the top of your file   jonas
what's broken about it  seems to work fine 
why not just use strings 
which version of capybara are you using  this should be solved in the 1 0 beta 
did that help you 
maybe it's a regression with rails 3 1  very strange  i'll close this issue for now  but please feel free to leave a comment 
which version of capy are you using  afaik this is fixed in 1 0 
why is it a problem  are you doing something which checks the xml instruction or doctypes  if so  why 
could you try updating to the latest selenium webdriver and see if the issue persists 
did you mean to file this for capybara webkit  they have their own issue tracker 
what do you users care about status codes  3   don't use capybara to tests apis  http   elabs se blog 34 capybara and testing apis  
can you provide a pull request with you imagine this to be worded 
why 
how about something like  fill_in  then  if we disallow it in one place  we should disallow it everywhere  right 
maybe i don't understand what you mean  could you provide an example of a test which is slow for you 
can you post this on the mailing list please  i'll respond there  this issue tracker is meant for reproducible bugs only

can you give an example  scripts _are_ opened with an editor by default  but maybe i am missing something 
can you try this on other mkv files 
could you upload that file  need to upload the whole thing as is  could be encoding related   or try to bisect that file until you find what's causing it 
can you confirm this please 
do you use a utf 8 locale in ranger  you can see it for example by running this command in ranger    eval import locale  p " " join locale getlocale     
can you reproduce it in other terminals 
what are you using it for  if i may ask  maybe it's a good idea to draw documents in a different color   
does it make more sense now 
what's the traceback 
can you try the newest git version  it should be fixed now 
how did i never notice this problem  fixed  thank you 
what os  python version and ranger version are you using  is anything else happening that might be suspicious 
how do you imagine it should work  also  what vi keybindings do you want in the console   cmap  or  copycmap  is your friend here 
does it happen with 1 particular directory  or everywhere 
maybe your term environment variable is wrong  mine is  rxvt unicode 256colors  and it works fine 
does it occur randomly or consistently  after some time  or right when you start ranger 
which xubuntu version are you running 
what exact commit are you both running 
maybe you have a trailing whitespace after the "true" 
how did you change the environment variable  maybe you do it in a place that is ignored in your particular setup 
which python version do you use 
why would ranger read less specific environment variables  if you want to use your highlight script  take a look at     config ranger scope sh   you can get it by typing  ranger   copy config scope 
maybe   ctrl r   
could you post the output of  echo  ranger_load_default_rc   it's a known feature issue that the default config is not loaded if this variable is set to  false  
did you get this fixed  can you try   
does this happen in every git repository  could you link me to a repository where this happens 
could you upload  install_log txt   also need the output of the following   stat  usr local bin ranger   file  usr local bin ranger   cat  usr local bin ranger 
does this happen on  1 8 1   does this happen without tmux 
does it make sense 
could you re run it  the first two should be fixed now but let's make sure  the third one was a false positive 
does this help  https   github com ranger ranger wiki upgrading
can you share your  config h  please 
what do you expect to see in a preview  do you know about a cli tool that generates one 
maybe copying the file so you could paste it is possible 
could you try an equally long filename with latin characters 
what are your    os distro  and version    python version   ranger version and are your ranger config files up to date 
how exactly are you measuring this 
what should it look like  they would not fit in 1 line 
why exactly do you need an alternative solution 
did you change your terminal's colors  can you run  file some mkv mp4  
do you mean running it with sudo the very first time  or just after already having run without sudo 
what's your  editor  set to  debian patches ranger to use  sensible editor  by default maybe ubuntu does the same or simply copies the debian patch 
do you have  chardet  installed for your python and which encoding does that report 
does the same thing happen when you run  ranger   clean  
do you want to it be in the preview pane or in a separate process  via rifle   the latter should be easy  the former not so much 
can you elaborate on bdist 
can you try    ranger  instead  2  the output of the first image is incomplete  can you please run  ranger   output txt  and send me the text file 
could you test this with  set preview_images false  please  i noticed a very similar issue and i think it's unrelated to image previews 
do you mean the selected file  we already invert fg bg so for me the foreground of the selection  is  black 
what language is this  is it using the latin alphabet 
maybe with the   w  flag added 
does it work when outside of ranger 
could you try to reproduce with  ranger   clean   it sounds like the problem is related to image previews 
what's the output for  locale  on the command line 
maybe  w  shows them 
does this happen if you close dragon drop a different way 
could you provide a file like this so we can test this 
did you remember to enable previews   preview_files    preview_images    use_preview_script    
do you have w3mimgdisplay installed  should be in the w3m package on arch 
could you check whether latest master escapes properly   btw  master has trash support using rifle  maybe check that out after confirming the bug  
could you try xterm 
does the same thing happen outside of tmux  in terminal app  with your previous ranger version  do you have image previews enabled 
how exactly do you run checksec on ranger 
how are you setting the sort order  normally it's natural by default 
did you set  preview_images_method kitty  
can you reproduce this with 1 9 2 or master 
do you have previews enable with w3m 
could you check the shebang of  which ranger   maybe it's getting run with the system python 
could you clarify what you mean  are you talking about ranger's metadata construct or file format specific metadata  like a movie's title  either way i don't think it's currently possible 
could you check whether #1367 is the same a similar issue 
can you reproduce the problem if you run  ranger   clean   that should run with default configuration 
what does  file applesingle  report the file as 
would ranger's history suffice  i believe   c o   c i   jump through history 
maybe check the  w3m_delay  setting 
could you try running  env lc_all en_us utf 8 ranger   clean  
could you please specify where in the ui you've noticed these  it'll make it much easier for people to fix  could be a good first issue for someone to tackle 
could you try running the master branch  cloning and running  ranger py  is enough  if that doesn't fix it try with  ranger  or ranger py    clean  
do you use any software like tmux or some window compositor 
maybe running ranger in screen tmux'd suit you better  setting up a systemd service that starts that session at boot 
does it happen when you run  ranger   clean  
what shell are you running  we've never seen this 
does ranger crash if you don't pass    debug   cause that would be a bug 
does it prevent caching if you use  exit 1  
why not install ranger using homebrew  btw 
could you attach the file to this issue 
what's your output for  locale  
what is your output for  tmux show option  gw  
did you install  atool  
do you have  preview_max_size  set 
maybe one of the integrations or custom commands on the wiki can help you  they're for search rather than filter but maybe that's good enough 
does it happen when you run  ranger   clean  
does  djvutxt  work fine on the file  or  if you don't have that installed   exiftool  
could you pull the latest and double check  thanks

what do you think 
would you be interested in working up a quick pull request to solve this  thanks 
what context is this coming up in  do you have files that actually have a slash in their name  do they work in other contexts and just not this one 
how do you forsee getting away from the existing providers usage working 
does that make sense help clarify  thanks 
could you include a backtrace to narrow down the problem  thanks 
which version of ruby you using  i don't think each_with_object is in 1 8  try 1 9 
can you give me a code sample that causes this to happen  i ran through the test suite  but apparently there's a gap here 
could you list the command line stuff you ran to get the desired behavior  hopefully that can help me narrow in on the disconnect  thanks 
does this happen consistently for you  if you can isolate a repro case that would make it a lot easier to track down  thanks 
do you need this functionality in particular 
could you try again and or use master to see if you are still getting this  thanks 
would you be up for submitting the needed documentation patches for us 
could you create a pull request with that change  thanks 
what version of fog are you using  what version of ruby  any other details you could give to pin down what might be going wrong would be very helpful  thanks

do you have any suggestions for dealing with api versioning 
would you be up for making a pull request accommodating the suggested change 
could you post what you are running and seeing for reference 
could you post some sample code that reproduces the issue 
would you be up for helping us work toward a pull request for that  thanks

could you supply the info for your fog bouncer usage  i suspect that would get me closer as well  thanks 
do you have an example of what you're doing  have you created the server already   the zone is another issue  there is an open bug floating around here somewhere

would you be up for creating a pull request to add this functionality  i'm certainly happy to answer any questions you might have along the way  thanks 
how about openssl  updating that might also help 
could that be the issue   icco    erjohnso and i think we should just delete this example or include some comments for users if they want to experiment it
what do you think 
could you give a bit more detail of what config you are passing in and how you are invoking it that is resulting in the error  thanks

does  a any_instance stub  hi  and_return 'bye'   fit your needs  that is  http   relishapp com rspec rspec mocks v 2 6 docs method stubs stub on any instance of a class
why else would you put it there 
can you give me a couple of days before i look into this  i'm at rubyconf right now  so      
what problem is this causing for you 
can i ask why you don't just run these two together

would that functionality resolve this feature request 
what ruby version manager are you using  what is the output of  gem which rspec  
can you gist your gemfile  and  spec_helper rb  
could you provide more details on how to reproduce 
maybe that can be refactored so that those four lines are pulled into  load_configuration_and_specs  method   mbj  would that meet your needs 
can you run  rvm pristine  on your gemset  this is much more likely to be an issue with your local install than anything else 
will that meet your needs 
can you open this on rspec mocks  i'll leave comments there once you've got an open issue  thanks 
do you want to take a stab at a pr removing those arguments 
can you gist your output   an example  not going to be able to help without more details 
do you mean link's in backtraces  or something within our formatter  the commit was to made to make the output from the formatter valid html 
what do others think    xaviershay  samphippen  soulcutter  cupakromer  we can also solicit community feedback on this issue but i want to hear from the other rspec contributors first 
can you put together an executable example demonstrating your problem  that's always the best way to get us something we can work with 
why is this causing you a problem 
can you add    vendor bundle  into your exclusion pattern

does that make sense 
what didn't work about the snippet 
can you reproduce with just rspec code 
can you provide the failure output you are seeing 
can you update your script to echo   test_files  so we can see what value that has 
can you put that together into a github repository that we can clone  and run to repro the issue 
can you provide us a reproduction script  you can look at https   github com rspec rspec core blob master report_template md
don't you think we should stick to https   github com rspec rspec core issues 2615

could you provide a sample application that reproduces the error 
do you mind to open a pull request for that  thanks for the issue ❤️
could you please provide us a sample application that reproduces the issue in isolation  that would help us find the issue 
can you try removing     cache mopidy  and then try again   bok other suggestions   i'm on vacation  thus mostly offline 
can you provide the output of  mopidy deps  
could you include the output of  mopidy   show deps  
what version of mopidy do you run  some important changes were made to the scanner in 0 17  as 0 16 were quite broken in that regard  http   docs mopidy com en latest changelog #v0 17 0 2013 11 23
what linux distro are you using  arch linux  have you disabled ipv6 support yourself  i guess this is the same issue as mopidy mopidy#75 
do you mean "mpd" as in "droid mpd client"  i guess it's time for a full update of the mpd clients review 
did you experience this with v0 7 or v0 8 
maybe mark relevant issues with a tag as well 
do you have a branch of mopidy webclient with your 0 16 updates somewhere  so i can try to reproduce it the same way you get this error 
why is that a problem  won't it just be empty 
how is this working out for you 
can you include the full output of the  mopidy  command 
which backend are you using 
could you please upload the file elsewhere  i am getting ' "result" "error" "error_code" "1012" "error_string" "cannot find requested object id " ' and am not able to download 
can you provide the output of  mopidy deps  
why was this emptied and closed 
what version do you run  how do you run the scan command  do you have less than 1000 tracks 
can you try reproducing the segfault to get a coredump and inspect the coredump with gdb  http   jodal no post 5779178001 log from the debugging of a segfault  is probably useful reading 
can you reproduce this issue without suspending  it seems like you had  mpdsession  actors being dead when used already at 12 07 05  which is before the suspend 
which mixer are you using 
do you know what mopidy backend was providing the music that caused the problem 
what version of ncmpcpp do you use 
can you reproduce this issue  what versions are you running of mopidy and ncmpcpp 
can you provide the output of  mopidy deps   and also the versions of glib and gstreamer 
can you confirm that  if so  it's not much we can do with that 
which local backend  json or sqlite or same result with both  are these local files or samba  nfs etc 
will the track start playing 
can you please continue the discussion at https   discuss mopidy com  feel free to post another comment here with the link to your continued discussion 
did you set the  http hostname  option as per https   docs mopidy com en latest ext http   if it doesn't look like this problem is an actual bug in mopidy then we should continue this at http   discuss mopidy com 
what do you want it for 
could you please retest this with develop at 3429487f701e5eb9ea53a0ebee1ea2779b595e1f or later 
can you reproduce with  gst play 1 0   gapless file        file             so we can see if it works "upstream" 
can you print the output of  mopidy deps  
does this have an advantage over just using another port 
what's wrong with you just setting this higher  https   docs mopidy com en latest config #confval core max_tracklist_length
could you provide a debug level scan log 
does this not do what you want  https   github com mopidy mopidy pull 1621
can we close this since there's nothing actionable for us here 
could you elaborate on the title  what's dynamic here  this needs more explanation i think 
where does mopidy core do that 
would that be helpful 
what's your usecase for not wanting the index  could you provide a test case to reproduce this 
does that work for you  can you foresee any issues with that 
could you put together a unit test that reproduces the problem  i'll then be able to look at it further 
what error are you seeing 
can you reproduce it in a unit test or a standalone project 
could you post the rest of your validator class 
do you have a using statement for the fluentvalidation namespace  if not  you'll need to add one as that's an extension method 
could you clarify what you're trying to do 
would you want the custom delimiter to be global  or per validator rule 
what does your action look like 
could you explain further what you’re trying to do 
could you provide more details on the use case for this  and why the existing mechanisms for setting the message aren't sufficient  thanks
could you maybe provide some more detail on what you're actually trying to do 
does that solve what you're trying to do  or is there a particular use case where this wouldn't work  jeremy
what would you imagine support for this would look like in fv 
how are you wiring up your validators into mvc 
what's the message that you do get 
why are you calling o addalltypesof ivalidator     and  registervalidatorsfromassemblycontaining startup     surely you only want to register the validators once 
could you put together a small sample project that reproduces the issue 
which version are you using 
which version of fv do you have installed 
what's your use case 
could you re phrase the question 
how are you wiring up the validators  are you using an ioc container or using the attribute based wiring 
what type is the orders property  and how is the ordervalidator defined 
could you put together a sample that reproduces the issue  thanks 
would that work for you 
could you send me either a unit test or small sample project that reproduces it  i’ll turn be able to look at it further  thanks 
which versions of microsoft aspnetcore mvc and fluentvalidation are you running 
which property is it saying is null  could you post the full stacktrace 
can you provide steps to reproduce  thanks 
could you put together a small sample project that reproduces the issue  i'll then be able to look further  thanks
what’re you trying to achieve 
what platform are you targeting  and which version of the c# compiler are you using 
which version of fluentvalidation are you using  and are you on  net core or full framework 
what's your use case for wanting a full path in the message 
could you be more specific  what kind of support are you after 
could you confirm which version of fluentvalidation you're using  if you could put together a small test project that reproduces the issue i can take a further look 
how is your validator defined  how are you calling it 
do you have any other dependences in your project that are trying to bring in an older version of microsoft aspnetcore mvc 
can you verify that this is the case once validators have been correctly wired up with the service provider 
does it work fine in a new fresh project   i’m going to guess that it will 
what are you trying to achieve by using it 
what do you think 
could you give it a try and confirm it’s working ok 
can you give it a try and confirm everything's working correctly for you 
wouldn't it be simpler to just use a custom validator for this 
maybe you could put together a small sample project  i'm finding it hard to understand exactly how you're invoking the validator 
what's the rule definition and the data type of the property 
how were you invoking mvc native validation 
how does that sound 
can you put together a small minimal sample project that reproduces the issue  i’ll then be able to take a look at it  thanks 
how are you resolving the validators inside your behavior 
how are you instantiating your validator  as the error message says  the service provider is only available when validators have been automatically instantiated as part of mvc's automatic validation 
does it work correctly outside of docker  if so then we can probably assume it’s related to your docker environment  are you able to provide steps to reproduce 
could you confirm that it's working correctly for you 
what kind of support are you looking for 
what exactly are you expecting fluentvalidation to do  can you be specific  perhaps you could provide some pseudo code illustrating exactly what you want 
could you answer my question please   what exactly is the message that you're seeing  i'll then be able to tell you if it's coming from asp net or from fluentvalidation 
would this work for you  or is there a specific reason why you'd need a global callback to do it 
can you update your version to v2 0 110526 and report back if this resolved your issue

can you provide the refseq too  thanks 
what browser is being used here 
what version of chrome are you seeing that under  could you provide me a link to the running jbrowse that's exhibiting that behavior 
would you be interested in submitting a pull request that does this 
would you be able to send me a link to your jbrowse instance that exhibits the problem so i could look at it directly 
does that do what you need 
what web browser and version do you see this on  do you maybe need to clear your browser cache 
can you find a way to reproduce it on that jbrowse instance 
can you try clearing the cache on firefox  i think i have seen this before and then clearing the cache made it go away somehow 
maybe you are visiting the wrong url in your browser  could you paste some of the messages in the error log 
would you be interested in implementing #97 and sending a pull request 
what web browser version is this  are there any error messages visible in the web developer console 
does that sound good 
could you provide a sample of the gff3 file  and the website url 
maybe i should make it so that will show in a popup box if you click  also  i could make it scrolly and sorty like the vcf genotypes too 
what version of perl are you using  does generate names pl crash  did   safemode work for you in version 1 10 9 
maybe it was not fixed 
would you happen to have a small piece of your bam file that we could check out  thanks
do you have a setup log  it seems like it works on my machine
what server are you using 
what happens when you convert it back 
maybe filter your vcf   are you zoomed in to a very small region   chome seems to still be the most performant browser for displaying big data in jbrowse 
what is the altered behavior 
why not just zoom into the exact coordinates of the highlighted region and select save     visible region  
do you by chance have any place where we can get sample data to use in development on this 
what is the issue with the score though  i think that if you had stored the score in the column 6 it would work in gff3tabix also
what web browser are you using  has generate names pl been run 
can you check out the setup log file and paste it here  i am going to suspect that somehow it did not complete properly
does that look possible  i think the bug is fixed but some older data directories might be have that issue
do you have a sample of your gff  it can be relevant as the idea is that the actual feature types in the gff get mapped to specific css classes
what would you like to have happen if there are more tracks than can fit on the screen  besides overflow with a scrollbar 
does that make sense or are you still trying to use the perl scripts with the desktop version 
do you have a sample gff we can check out by chance 
can you attach a setup log file please 
can you show how it is embedded in the html 
can you describe more what caused this to happen 
do you have an example url i can test against  i tried to create a test case by emitting a header with no value  but i cannot replicate the error 
maybe the output format changed  can you check and verify please 
what are you trying to extract 
would you please open a new bug 
can you create a runnable test case that demonstrates the issue you're having 
do you have html i can test 
how to use the new library with this modification in a java project    it seems the downloads in http   jsoup org download has not been updated thanks
could you please create a  gist  https   gist github com   with the  input html  file you're using 
can we see the relevant code that loads information into your "link" object 
what platform   version are you on 
can you reopen if you can find repro steps 
which jsoup version did you use 
what version are you using  i can't repro this issue in current versions  here's a test  http   try jsoup org  zonf7j2hjcdoz2jdsfcb obkiww
maybe suggest a selector for data contains 
what's the use case 
can you give me a code snippet and a site that demonstrates this issue you're having so it can be replicated 
can you provide a fuller example please  i e  sample code using cleaner  and the input and output html strings 
what would be the benefit  jcenter already proxies maven central  which jsoup is published to 
do you know any example sites i can validate a fix on 
where in the jar should it go 
can you please post the html content generated by the jsp page 
can you post some example code 
can you confirm that you sent it with the http  rather than like  blog dota2 com  as seen in the browser head 
maybe one of your random uas  or your proxy  is creating problems  could you paste a complete small testcase we can validate 
can you confirm which version you're using 
what's your build environment  how are you initiating the tests  can you add the xml from surefire reports 
what do you think 
do you have a short example of problematic html 
can you provide a working code sample to test 
can you provide the code  and not a picture of a code  would be useful to put in asserts so we can see what you expected  too 
could be an encoding issue  do you set the default encoding to utf 8 everywhere 
can you add a test case so i can understand what you mean 
would a    site myapp search_sites specialsearchsite  command line argument solve the problem well enough for your tastes 
can you provide a test case maybe 
what version of whoosh are you using  an svn revision or the version tuple out of  whoosh __init__ py  would help greatly 
did you add 'haystack' to your settings installed_apps and is the haystack directory in the project path 
can you give me a ball park on what low volume is so i can try to create a test environment  version of whoosh django python would help as well 
can i ask if you're using haystack 1 0 x or git master  sha  d6463efab0229cb756d0d6a63316bd9ca3623166 should have fixed this bug 
which version of whoosh are you using 
what version of django   which search backend are you using 
what version of haystack are you using 
where do put you this code  and  where should we put this code in the app  where 
can you please provide more details  what do you mean the document is already indexed  can you see it in elasticsearch  when do you see this message  thanks
what version tag branch are you running  this has been fixed for some time 
would you mind writing a failing test case for this  it may just be a matter of dropping words without options indicating they were actually found 
does your settings file include use_tz true   if not  please see https   docs djangoproject com en 1 6 topics i18n timezones   if that's set  your models shouldn't be returning dates without timezones  which is what sounds like what you're seeing 
can you import the model from the other db that you need access to and use that model in your index 
do you have something like an extension which monkey patches multiprocessing to use 0mq 
what backend are you using 
could you provide some more details of what the exact problem was  and what you're proposing to fix it 
which version of xapian haystack are you using  i'm wondering whether this might be connected with their recent 2 0 0 release since it's not one of the core backends which we test 
can you contribute a test which reproduces this problem  at first glance  i'm assuming this is what happens when the form receives an empty value for  q  
would you want to write that up and pr 
can you test with the stock haystack 
does this happen with a smaller block size 
do you want to start a pull request 
did you test this with the current master branch of haystack   build_solr_schema  runs as expected on django 1 11 2 on python 3 6 1 
can you submit a test which fails reliably 
can you provide some log files  and which exact elasticsearch versions  both backend and python client 
does your edit mean this issue can be closed 
what happens if you actually use it 
do you have a reproducible test case for this 
did you not see  http   github com robey paramiko issues#issue 3
what value did you end up picking instead of 20 packets 
do you have a reproducible example  etc  
could you create a patch pull request of your findings    
shouldn't you be reading from stdout _before_ calling  recv_exit_status    
could you provide a minimal code example that causes the problem  and describe what happens when you use normal  open ssh  i suspect you need a try except block 
does this help any  http   stackoverflow com questions 27669813 embedding public key as string in paramiko application
can you clarify the exact issue you're having  maybe  novalidconnectionserror  being raised is a red herring 
can i help with this somehow 
maybe this should be an option 
can you ssh in without paramiko 
could you provide any code for context 
can you please share which version you are using 
do we assume all plugin help is ltr  probably not  are multi language plugin help files even supported in core 
could it be a localisation issue 
could earlier ie versions trigger quirks mode that cause issues 
maybe this needs some code in the upgrade scripts to convert existing users   bloke can you confirm 
maybe we should just document the process somewhere   would that suffice 
what browser is the mis alignment happening in   and on which panel  thanks 
what's wrong with using  sort "name"  attribute 
does the problem persist when you leave off the   f  option 
can you please provide which version of couchdb you are using  your  local ini  file  the path to where you installed couchdb  thanks 
can you post a full reproduction including  curl  commands to create insert the document 
can you paste your full local ini file  our tests  https   github com apache couchdb blob master src chttpd test chttpd_cors_test erl
can you show us your replication definition    error econnrefused   suggests that the source or target isn’t available 
can you get us copies of the couch log files from these machines when this happens 
do you have automatic compactions configured or anything like that  i think we may need a fair bit more detail to offer much constructive advice here 
can you share the exact line from  couch log  please  thanks 
do you get the exact same error on every node  or does the shard in the error line change 
can you confirm that you have   httpd  secure_rewrites   true   thanks 
can you retry with integers just in case we're in some funky ieee 754 area 
what happens if you use the  get   db  _explain  endpoint on your queries  see  https   github com apache couchdb pull 866 and https   github com apache couchdb pull 962 these fixes will be in couchdb 2 2 0 
does a curl from the command line of that local couch to the remote ip address at port 5984 also fail 
can you try increasing your ulimit for files   ulimit  n   beyond the default 4096 
can you try running couchdb in a terminal  or screen tmux session rather than as a daemon  then see what errors it turns up in that session 
what happens if you attempt to put an 8mb json doc  not an attachment  just an 8mb document  
can you try adding more cpus to your docker instance  views are run in a separate process  so you need more than 1 cpu core 
can you make sure you have  apt transport https  installed 
who's "we"   wink

what exactly are you asking 
could you try to run start from a pristine tree and just run  make  without a preceding  autogen sh  configure  
can you try a simple  make   no autogen autoconf automake  on a pristine tree 
did you try a  make  only   not even configure   you shouldn't overwrite the original  makefile  see also  https   github com johnlangford vowpal_wabbit issues 582 https   github com johnlangford vowpal_wabbit issues 540
can you confirm 
did you check using valgrind  markus
could you do  make clean    make  and store whole build output somewhere like pastebin com 
does this error occur if you use the system python  or only when you use anaconda's  generally speaking  you cannot mix c++ boost libraries compiled with different compilers abis etc 
can you make a reproducible test case 
can you create a simple complete example exhibiting it 
what happens if you simplify  run  vw  not as a daemon  drop some of the options  does it work  try to run same under sudo  does it work  etc 
what do you get when you run these 
what are your initvwconfig values 
do you have a short piece of code which i can compile exhibiting the problem 
maybe there should be a exponential backoff retry there before giving up 
did you pass the allreduce options 
could you update the docker recipe 
why do you expect a loss accumulation  the daemon mode is generally designed to serve predictions rather than monitoring losses 
can you provide full directions for making this reproducible 
does the issue go away when adding the    onethread  option  
do you want to send pull request 
will that impact bindings  in other words  how transparent is this to be used from a c like  flat  non mangled  api 
can you add some sklearn references here from sklearn  i could not find it 
can you possibly provide concrete information in order to reproduce  including training data and vw command line  thanks
can you try using 123 for the random seed   random seed 123    in the first run and then using 10   random seed 10    in the second run  this should produce different ctrs 
can you try the solution in this so post https   stackoverflow com a 58365874  it's a different issue but it seems some people are having trouble after upgrading
can you try adding   q 1  to the netcat command 
did you run the tests with an epsilon value for float comparisons  ideally  i'd also like ci to run for arm but that may take a bit longer 
could you please try running your notebook based on master  you can install the pip package from latest master with 
does a logistic regressor make sense given vw is pretty much modeling with a linear function 
can you describe what you're thinking of 
did you install all the required libraries   the list is found under the troubleshooting section of the pypi page you linked 
what exception does your  try  except  catch  on what does your code hang 
how do you know some statuses are being missed  keep in mind the streaming api only provides a very small "sample" of the entire stream 
what do you think 
can we just revert this change for now  i don't recall what value it added 
can you try the same code using the latest version of tweepy from this repository

what is  tw  
can you show the relevant code  tweepy does not have a  post_with_media  method  if you mean   api update_with_media   https   tweepy readthedocs io en latest api html#api update_with_media   this is likely something you're including in the status itself 
can you reproduce this from  emacs  q   works fine for me in emacs trunk  and 739760229c25979f00456ce62b0bf729d6e6fcda explicitly disallows company in the minibuffer  not yet pushed to elpa  
does pressing  return  work for you 
why would you want slime  it's for common lisp  not elisp  which already has a decent built in backend   but anyway  this one should work  http   www emacswiki org emacs slime company el
should we add it  you can also try to set that variable to  t   see if you like the result 
could try try edebug ging through  company files  complete   to see where this completion comes from 
maybe even replace its clang completion source    
what is your major mode in the repl buffer 
did you change the value of  company begin commands  from the default  for org mode  it either has to be  t  or include  org self insert command

does  c m i  work for you  then company should  too 
what's your os  emacs and company versions  i've never seen the behavior you're describing  can you reproduce it with  say   company dabbrev   try a  text mode  buffer  
how are you trying to use it 
could you give an example without dependency on  pos tip

would  be an adequate workaround for you 
what does   company capf 'candidates "da"   return 
what backend  is it  company capf   does  c m i  show you the desired completions 
did you set  company auto complete  to non nil  that's what it does

do you expect completion to  looks   it works for me in all three cases 
what do you mean offset  can't reproduce  seems to be positioned fine 
does it  or does it not work with  m x company yasnippet   i can't reproduce  fwiw  and there's no snippet  defun  here  only  def  which expands to defun 
how 
do you have a screenshot

how do i reproduce this  e g  how do i get it to suggest the current file's functions at all 
which usage do you mean  in  company semantic doc or summary  
do you encounter this case frequently 
could you show a full  step by step scenario  how to reproduce the problem  preferably starting with  emacs  q  l     company

did you enter the ids of the tasks it impedes 
do you have any other plugins that might be agile related  it looks like something is re defining the story class 
why do you definitely need several task trackers  yes  there's a way to implement this  but it would make the task board incredibly complicated to use 
does this file hold any label data  you could try copying over the file labels yaml default to labels yaml if it is 
what other plugins do you use 
do you see any javascript errors  or errors in the redmine logfiles 
why would you want to do that vs just removing unnecessary tasks  on jul 5  2011 4 25 pm  "ogerardin"   reply reply github com  wrote

what versions of redmine and backlogs are you using 
why would we want to do this  not all tasks start end at the same time  it's a different matter for stories 
what language is redmine configured to use 
did configure a label stock in the backlogs setup  the printable cards option doesn't show unless you have  and the sprint has stories

could you try if latest master fixes it 
could you try latest master 
what versions of ruby  redmine and redmine backlogs are you running 
could you try copying the default labels from "lib labels labels yaml default" to "lib labels labels yaml"  i think issue #888 is a similar issue  you can choose the label afterwards in the administration  plugins  redmine backlogs configure 
could be a problem with permissions or workflow setup 
does it work or are there any problems 
why not just place 2 image in 1   li    for example   ul   li   img src "image1 jpg"   img src "image2 jpg"    li   li   img src "image3 jpg"   img src "image4 jpg"    li    ul  jan

do they require that translation files be in a particular format though 
do those exist on your system 
why do you want to run nginx reverse proxy in front of webmin  security  speed  other

can you tell me where that assumption is wrong  is it 
does that work for you 
could you provide more details on why you want to make this logging callbacks asynchronous  i'm not following the purpose from the brief explanation provided so far  thanks 
do you have a reference for unit testing frameworks that support this  on any platform

do you use "hide passed tests"  is there any metric to identify the "simplest failing test" 
could you extract your code into a standalone testpage  you could use this jsbin as a starting point  http   jsbin com wagafeqequ 1 edit
would you be able to register your custom element in a   qunit begin  callback function  http   api qunitjs com qunit begin    that seems like the right mechanism for this kind of task 
maybe qunit itself does something wrong from require js' point of view 
how about a tiny wrapper script that passes your argument through  one of many  glob modules  then executes each file 
would you have time to write a fix for it

can you please paste the full output of  rchekcin  with the   d  flag  also  the version of git tfs you are running 
how far deep into your filesystem is your git repo  that is probably a larger consumer of path chars

can you run the command again with   d  option 
did the content change when renaming it  tell us the more information you have on your case    
how did you created it  perhaps adding the files before renaming the branch and then changes end up embedded in the changeset

do you have a fix for this 
do you have time to start a pull request to make that change 
do you have  git  command line tools installed an in your  path  
maybe set a breakpoint or add debug logging to  workingcopyhasunstagedoruncommitedchanges   that should at least show what  git tfs  thinks is going on 
do you have the same behaviour if you follow  https   github com git tfs git tfs blob master readme md#get the source code and build
do you have a custom diff program set up  or is this using the default 
did you try to put the whole branch name between double quotes 
did you look at the tfs error code  it seems you have a conflict of naming   
does it work any better if you try omitting both  repository_output_path  and    workspace "sources_output_path"  options 
what do you get when running git tfs list remote branches http   mytfshost 8080 tfs mycollection in your command line  cmd or powershell

how would the  taggitfilter  be different from a regular  modelmultiplechoicefilter   also  i'm pretty sure we could add  lookup_expr  support  here  https   github com carltongibson django filter blob 0 14 0 django_filters filters py#l231 l234  by simply joining the field name with the lookup 
do you can provide contents of  installed_apps

do you have username  email and password in attr_accessible

how did you install the library  the files bddtest cpp and trace h live under  pubsubclient tests src lib   so i'm not sure how it has ended up in the path your error message reports 
does that answer your question 
how did you install the library  it is picking up code from the tests subdirectory  which indicates you haven't installed the library correctly 
what hardware are you using and what network client library are you using  those bytes must be being added by something outside of the  pubsubclient  
what about it isn't working  what have you tried  are there any error messages you can share  should i guess what your seeing 
what hardware are you running this on  are you able to publish simple messages to a broker  is it unique to this message 
what clientid are you connecting with  this sounds like you are using a clientid that is already in use  so you are getting into a connection battle with another client 
do you see the  publish message  x  output to confirm it is calling the publish function 
what output do you get  what return code does client connect return with 
how is that related to the pubsubclient code 
can you share what output that gives 
which sample exactly are you trying to use  please provide a link so i know what you are looking at

does the crash happen if you connect without the will message  how large are the messages you're dealing with 
what problem are you trying to solve 
what does your mosquitto log show 
what exactly did you try  i'm not setup to test any code with this library currently 
what have you tried to resolve this yourself  what do you mean by 'act unnormal' 
how often are you publishing  are you calling  client loop    regularly  the log shows the client is being timed out  which means it hasn't sent anything for over 30 seconds 
what network client are you using with this library  does it support ssl connections

do the labels already exist   see https   github com pengwynn octokit issues 104#issuecomment 6603990  
what sort of features did you have in mind  part of #194 has landed 
does the  lib octokit client authorizations rb  https   github com pengwynn octokit blob master lib octokit client authorizations rb  not give you what you need   maybe i don't understand the question 
how are you authenticating with octokit 
what about http   rubydoc info gems octokit 
what version of openssl  assuming openssl   i forget if the  state sslv3  means you're using sslv3  or it's expecting v3 and you're not using it   
how are you authenticating  you'll need to be an  owner or admin  https   github com octokit octokit rb blob 752e387e34c4190c5fd2c9451744e056df5023e2 lib octokit client repositories rb#l297  to list teams 
can you provide the results of  gem which octokit  command and possibly a bit more detail about when the deletion fails 
what is the problem 
do you have 2fa enabled on that account 
can we close this one out 
can you try passing   private    false  and letting me know if you're still seeing the issue 
does it have the  public_repo  or  repo  scope 
how do you load the epub file   if you're using an arraybuffer or an uint8array  you might be interested by the issue #23 
maybe we should log a warning when generating an empty zip file  
does that solve your issue  
does it not work 
do you think we should separate that code as an extra module   not tied to  jszip  but to  jsziputils  for example 
do you have an example of what you're trying to generate  
why would you need that  install jszip through npm and  require  it 
what do you mean by "unnecessarily longer"   i didn't tested it  but  encodeuricomponent generated replace   + g  " "  replace     g  "_"    should give the same result 
what do you mean by "add a file to the zip without modifying it"   do you have an example  
do you think that replacing the "run" button with a warning in ie 9 is ok  
could you share the code sample using jszip    and the files used if possible   also  what is the browser or the version of nodejs you use  
how are you writing the images to disk 
what browser do you use   do you have a uint8array shim on your page  
does meteor not provide a build step runtime for client side commonjs dependencies 
couldn't you just create a new empty zip object 
could you paste the code that triggers this error  
which version of nodejs do you use  
could you provide a code snippet of what triggers the issue  
which feature doesn't work  
how many files are you loading   what would be the total size of the zip file  
what part does not work   if it's the download part  it may be linked to https   github com eligrey filesaver js issues 12 
which output format do you use    blob     base64   
what does  grunt build   verbose  or  grunt serve   verbose  say  
how do you manipulate this file in v2 and in v3  
could you check the  zip files  object   in both cases you should have the same entries 
could you add the code snippet using jszip  
could you check  object keys zip files     it should not contain any standalone folder  only your csv files  how do you check the generated zip file  
do you have a stacktrace for this error  
could you try with the  master  branch    you will need to re generate the  dist   folder with  grunt build  
does the slideshow work if you refresh the page a second time 
how do i use your code  where do i put it into my site  thanks a lot 
does anyone have a solution to this for the new version of backstretch  thanks a lot   
when it is loaded 
can you please provide examples of a backstretched page  it might help communicate the point more clearly 
do you have a link that you could share 
maybe the error message is referring to another issue  –scott
do you mean don't change the size of backstretch image while change div dimensions  if the div does not change it's dimensions backstrecht should do nothing 
do you have access or rights to change the sourcecode of your site

can you paste the 5 lines before and after as well please 
do you have a simple example page to demonstrate this  sounds like it could just be due to the backtracking overflow bug detailed in #37
what feeds does this occur with  are you using 1 3 on both 
what version of php are you using  i'm assuming php 4 x 
can you please post your php version and post to http   gist github com  the contents of your compiled file  thanks 
where is a url being encoded  this doesn't seem like the correct behaviour 
do you have a use case for why we shouldn't double encode  in most cases  we definitely want to 
what is the issue 
what's the feed url 
what are the results of your compatibility test 
do you mind posting an quick note about it somewhere at the demo webpage 
what protocol are you using if it's not  http   https  then  i'm pretty sure  http   appsforce back myblog  feed atom  is the correct url

would that be ok  i'll also add explicit logging to the class  backed by typesafe's logging lib   log4j     david
how's this going 
could you give an example of thrown exceptions 
why is the max norm better than the 2 norm 
what did you have in mind  simple replacement of the library  or a larger interface change 
what were you expected the transpose to do  take the conjugate  or leave it as is  i assume the latter 
maybe someone wants to do a pr 
can you say a bit more about your use case  i can look into doing something with blocks or something
did you check if the docset bundle is present there 
can't open local html    is there empty line without tab spaces prefix in the middle  that trips many markdown parsers 
should work on 10 8 otherwise   did you try running directly from xcode  need to setup cmd args in scheme editor  
did you run both with the same cmd line and over the same set of files   the logs are quite a bit different 
did you try with   docset platform family key  seems like it might fix it 
does it work if you restart xcode 
does it work if you comment out line 41 
did you try with    no repeat first par  
would you consider releasing an official installer with the binary  for those of us who weren't so lucky as to have a working binary pre xcode 5 1  
can you prepare pull request with your changes 
might be 10 12 related   can you try using the same generated html on older os 
can you provide a failing test  or at least provide the values for  encoding default_internal    encoding default_external  and  list_of_floats   thanks 
which redis rb version are you using  sounds like it is trying to use the deprecated single bulk protocol  could you try upgrading to see if the problem persists 
does the same issue show when you use redis rb without hiredis

maybe you forgot to set the  pmessage  callback  the following snippet works for me 
can you confirm this solves the issue for you 
can anyone shed any light on whether there is still an issue here 
what is in your  sentinels   looks like there you might have the wrong hostname used 
what version are you running  that code has been running for over 2 years and haven't heard of this before  so that might be a clue 
can you retry your test with   reconnect_attempts    0   does the mentioned problem still occur 
did you try using the  punsubscribe  command 
can you  telnet  to that ip and port 
can't you just not pass the option 
can you be more specific about what is broken  got an exception  backtrace 
can you explain how this is related to the ruby client 
should we handle invalid option 
could that have something to do with this 
could you paste your batteries_config ml file   just the non comments  of course 
can you try with a recent git checkout of batteries  i seem to remember some ocaml 3 12 bugs coming up and being fixed in the git repository 
would you like to contribute

do you mind posting a copy of the file s  that's giving you problems 
could you post the text itself  i'd like to see how it renders for me 
did you get to the bottom of the issue   udaiveers 
would you like to submit a pull request to update   readme md     sassanh 
how about on develop 
why not just declare the class like this   class polygon       
can you give an example  an example for what you mean with the standard recommendation would be helpful
can you try out develop again  this should be closable
how far along is this new syntax  😳 if it's pretty much accepted and standardized i'll look to support it  otherwise i'd prefer to hold off until it becomes official 
what is different in es6  could you link to documentation  and what is the problem with indenting them 
did you set the appropriate global from the readme 
what is your indentkeys setting 
why would an input field cause that  i think it is probably some inline code
can't reproduce  maybe adding the type attribute will help 
can you give some example code 
what did you expect 
what package and what version of it did you try to install 
what do you think  what do you use the categorical distribution for 
do you know what exact versions of each of the assemblies you are using  are these nuget packages  zip downloads or manual builds 
what do you think  would this work for you 
do you know which one is used referenced  b  i suspect this is related to the parallelization logic  does this also happen if you do  control usesinglethread    first 
could you open a pull request 
could you provide a simple repro somewhere so i can have a look at it 
can you provide a simple repro  and the specific versions you've been using  math ne numerics  mono  
would this work for your  thanks  christoph
do you know what mono version this is 
who is calling domultiply in your case 
does this sound reasonable 
can you send me the contents of  etc exports on the master node and  etc fstab on a worker node 
what config are you trying to change  i've made a patch  yet to be merged  that allows to reload config  see https   github com datacratic starcluster tree dev_config_fcts or pr https   github com jtriley starcluster pull 162
how many nodes are in the cluster  how many jobs do you have queued  what is the expected behavior  more details here would help  thanks 
what instance type and ami are you using  also what region are you in  i'll test this and see if i can reproduce the issue   
can you check your   home  starcluster logs debug log  for the error and paste the exception  search for  incompatiblecluster    for now you can revert back to 0 95 with 
what do you mean it doesn't work  i use this setting and it works as i expect
what version are you using  see this line  https   github com jtriley starcluster blob ae535dc2357ae0280e50e02d1c2fab334520eaea starcluster sshutils py#l205
what about rendering a badrequest list errors  doing a serialization of those errors automatically using conneg 
can you attach  inline  the stack trace 
did you annotate the indexcontroller with other than  resource annotation 
can you write a test case to help us to solve this issue  thanks you so much 
can we close here 
can you open a pull request with this fix  please 
did you see the  qmap   qnoremap  commands  this remapping of the  e  key works for me   best regards  xaizek
could you please check whether branch  fix osx getmntent  works for you 
did you generate this file with version of repository that includes 54f65cb or it was installed with an older version  i thought it's fixed  see #48  
what's so specific about "windows 10 64 bit + conemu" configuration  does it work in other configurations 
why do you use  kbd p  kbd  and not  kbd p  kbd  if you don't want to move source file  source file is not removed  but moved 
maybe displaying attributes of interest in additional columns would do 
can you show  ls  l    config vifm scripts   or just check that scripts have executable bit set 
what version of urxvt do you have  by the way 
does this happen if you run any other application like shell    shell   or  less      less  c   
would  kbd n  kbd  just cycle through  01  and  03  or go  01      03      02  and then backwards in reversed order 
how do you want to use it  currently you can get it in   f  if command is given     range  e g       echo  f   
what's does the error message say  does it appear inside vifm or in vim 
does it work if you do    bat  c  q  on some file 
doesn't it already work  it says "enter" as it's treated specially  but  kbd esc  kbd  doesn't need special handling  not sure about  kbd q  kbd   it would standout among other commands then 
what's your shell  could launching it be this slow 
maybe always after a preview or running a particular command  you're also talking about previous screen  does that screen come from vifm itself 
do you have preview enabled  this can cause trouble on certain files for sure 
do you mean something like specs parallel_spec opts  but for rspec2  
what was the solution to the problem  upgrading the parallel gem    just asking so other searchers find an answer 
can you try to fork and do a pull request     
does it work on 1 9 2   looks like an issue of the recent test_options fix    
how about  if test_options include  '  profile '     do not add   profile   
can you  bundle open parallel_tests  and remove the "grep  v" part in tasks rb to see if it results in any output  
can you make a pull that adds them together  
does this happen within the run or maybe if 1 process finishes after other processes have finished  
can you add a failing test or make an failing example project   parallel_tests should also print the command it's running  maybe this helps further debugging this
how do you normally pass those jvm options    jvm_foo 1 ruby xxx   
does it work if you prefix your command with  rails_env test  
do any tests contain a  require  or  include   if so  try moving it to a  before    background   or  setup  block 
what does your database yml look like 
how did you fix it  
does it work when run on it's own   either  rake db schema load  or  test_env_number 4 rake db schema load 
did you add the env 'test_env_number'  to the test database  
how about this  
why do you need seeds for every group   if something fails you can reproduce by running only the failed group with it's seed
did you figure it out  
does https   github com grosser parallel_tests wiki#with capybara040selenium    by rgo help  
could use   s    single  pattern  run all matching files in the same process   to make this work

do changes propagate to slaves immediately  if not i would consider this expected behavior  otherwise you might get the old value directly after write 
which version of predis and redis 
did you try the very same lua script directly within  redis cli  to make sure that it works as expected 
do you have any issue with that 
what rest client version do you use   because the 1 4 1 version include a fix that seems to be related to your bug

what are the frameworks that log the other calls  
can't you call #http_body on the exception to get the response body  or am i missing something 
can you try on 1 6 3  
why don't you simply not add a timeout parameter  
do you have a minimal reproducer  i'm trying to wrap my head around the problem 
can you try  v1 7 2 rc1     gem install   pre       i think the more general fix will have to wait for a later release

what version of rest client are you running  i'm not able to reproduce this 
do you know if net  http has any support for specifying custom http verbs 
which version are you running   restclient  platform default_user_agent  will give the most useful version info 
what is  gem configuration   at first glance  this doesn't look like something that belongs in rest client itself 
what is the advantage of this over using should_receive 
what specific documentation would you like to see added  pull requests for improved docs happily accepted    
what version are you using 
what problem are you experiencing as a result

can you please try whether the issue also exists with phpunit 4 6 3 and php code coverage 2 0 16  thanks 
can you please try whether the issue also exists with phpunit 4 6 3 and php code coverage 2 0 16  thanks 
maybe you haven an older  globally installed phpunit that interferes 
does the problem still exist in phpunit 5 3 
does it work on the current version 
can you confirm 
can you please test with xdebug 2 5 1 
does this happen with the newest php and xdebug  7 1 4  2 5 3 
can you point me to the sourcecode location you are interested in 
can your try that  if not  can you provide a test case that demonstrates the issue  check examples  for how to write a test case 
can you create a test case for this  cheers 
do you have a  js  executable as  e g   spidermonkey installs 
mustache js doesn't compile at all  so making compilation async can't really be done    — why not use mu 
does this issue still happen in master  could you make a patch   pull request against current master if it does 
can you create a test case for this 
can you provide a failing test case 
what are the details of the error  i am using requirejs 2 1 2 and mustache 0 7 2 and do not get any errors

do you have any callbacks or anything that are adjusting things  if you could post as much as possible of your models in a gist or something that would help 
did you try doing the destroy_all from console  pretty sure this is not an mm issue

does that make sense 
does that help  or did i miss something 
what's your actual problem 
what do you mean by that 
do you have an idea in mind  and yes  you're crazy  but probably not for  just  this reason  😛
how does that code run 
how many gems do you have installed  how did you install ruby 
what are you testing 
what problem are you seeing and how do you reproduce it 
why not just use  assert_predicate   the error message is even nicer   expected 2 to be odd  
what are you actually trying to accomplish  can you show me what you've tried so far 
what gems do you have installed 
while using 5 11  it's been this way since 5 0 iirc  was there problems associated to a minor bump 
what is it you gain by defining  private  assertions 
why are you using stub on a mock object  what are you really trying to do  does that first line imply that it worked before that version 
what about moving the stub to the non delegator object 
can you provide more information 
did you use the "  quickstart sh" script or did you install packages through apt  or perhaps hand built from source  
could you try to trace down in more detail what's happening 
maybe we could resurrect the  feincms_compat_tags  hack  https   github com feincms feincms commit f32bd89601ad0240fa6dabd3b72d7cb039f50e75

can you try 5126ba8985fd2462a069c20f9542ecf6a117a478  
could you try 5dbe487a89a76801344eb7d9c63d5e327a6cd7e0   it has the change you proposed  worded a bit differently but the net effect should be the same  
does that help 
does that help 
which version s  of feincms and django mptt are you running currently 
might be the recent changes to setup py perhaps 
maybe we could break backwards compatibility a bit more for 1 3 and rename the media folder to static for the 1 3 release 
do you want to make a pull request 
can you post the full file containing your  linkablemediafilecontent  
did you remove  django contrib contenttypes  from  installed_apps  by chance  feincms seems to depend on the contenttypes app  probably because we are using the contenttypes' id for a cache key somewhere 
could you please add a bit more detail  which branch are you using  master or next  what were you doing when you got that error 
did you call page create_content_type richtextcontent  twice in models py 
did the installation run through smoothly  no errors or other problems 
what branch are you looking at  1 6 x 
can you check whether this applies to older versions of ckeditor   4  as well  this would be very helpful 
can you confirm please  this bugfix would definitely be worth another 1 7 release  maybe even a new release in the 1 6 series 
maybe you have a suggestion how the documentation could be improved  or maybe a different error message for django 1 5  when function based generic views do not work 
do you have an idea for a paragraph or so that would make that more clear 
do we have out of date documentation mentioning  cleanse true  somewhere 
did you run into any problems  i just tested locally  and feincms 1 13 1 and django 1 11 seem to work well together 
maybe you have mediafiles in a dropdown somewhere  it sounds like  raw_id_fields    "mediafile"    might help 
does specifying the app help  something like    manage py migrate medialibrary

would you mind seeing whether this suggestion is compatible with those in  issue 8  https   github com scrod nv issues 8  
maybe something like you suggested and regex searches 
wouldn't it be easier simply to option drag the note out of nv's list onto the textmate icon in the dock

could you test with my gravis typhoeus gem  
does the memory leak occur with your patch only  or does it also occur without it 
how can i reproduce it 
can you provide code to reproduce your problem 
can you update libcurl  2  was everything ok in typhoeus 0 3 3 
could you check that 
which typhoeus version are you using  it works fine with 0 5 0 rc

can you show me the curl command you are using 
do you want to take a step at it  i would do it otherwise and release tomorrow an updated ethon and typhoeus version 
what is  stub_request  doing  seems like webmock   
did you require typhoeus   require 'typhoeus'  
does that help  also i think typhoeous' adapter version should be updated too  not sure which you are playing around with 
could you test with the most recent one  these problems are mostly due to old libcurl version 
does that help 
does it also help you 
can provide code to demonstrate you problem 
did  forbid_reuse  help  i read about that problem and that comes up pretty frequently 
did you use another http client 
could you provide a pr for it  that way it is easier for me 
would you be willing to push a pr with some tests 
why can't you use it 
would you be interested in implementing this change 
would you like to create a pr  thanks again   
what's the use case 
maybe you have caching turned on 
what would the benefit be of changing this now to return  nil  instead of  0

do you mean multiple surveys on the same page  we really didn't design the plugin to support this but i'll take a look at the issue 
could you let us know what version of rails you are working with  this command works without the fixtures argument in rails 2 3 5 and 2 3 8 on my machine 
could you let us know if you're still experiencing this issue with the latest surveyor 
could you try to reproduce the above 
what version of rails are you using 
did you run  rails generate surveyor install  after upgrading surveyor

maybe it's a  tail  f  to read a log  if i disable being able to reconnect when a command is entered  someone else will complain 
can you describe how that didn't work 
can you please post your program here  does it create a window and call   show  on it 
do other opengl apps games work in your vm 
how did you install ruby 1 9 3 
how about monkey patching 
does  gem install gosu examples   then running  gosu examples  work for you  it contains the tutorial and works here  i use it to test gosu all the time

which webserver are you running rails with  faye only works with thin 
how are you making the request  and what browser are you using  you should get a 400 "bad request" response by doing this 
can you try it out and let me know how it goes 
can you code up an example that shows this error  are you using the node or ruby server  is the client in the browser or on the server 
can you confirm that this only happens for cross domain faye connections 
could you see if you can reproduce it against http   github com jcoglan faye websocket ruby   i've heard a few people have this problem but we still don't know the root cause 
do you have code to demonstrate this  i don't fully understand the description so better to have something precise so i know what we're discussing 
which url are you using to load the browser client 
do have any idea how this is happening  or indeed  why  gcd  is implemented as an instance method on all objects 
does this fix the problem for you  https   github com faye faye commit dd3a1b660c55c3d609f4beb84c549c27c5a87a76
could the encoding problem be in your code 
can you try out the examples in https   github com faye faye websocket node in your copy of chrome  so we can see if there's problems with it 
how are you creating the client   new faye client 'http   faye example com faye'   ought to work 
can you change the client so that doesn't append extra characters to the url to give it to connect to 
what type of client is it  is it in the browser or on the server  if on the server  is it using the in process transport or going over websocket 
does that mean i should close the issue 
what's happening on your system 
do you have rvm rbenv installed

could you take a look and give me some feedback 
does that answer your question 
can you confirm 
can you provide code for one of your tests that fails  does this only happen when using the redis backend  or also when using the in memory engine 
what data is the client sending and receiving after you've called  client disconnect     you can set  faye logger   console   or some other logger type object  to see what's going on 
could i ask why rails is depending on faye  i thought actioncable was only going to use websocket driver 
which version of faye are you running    node or ruby 
can you clarify what the problem is  and how your patch fixes it 
can you show me a small demo that illustrates the problem you're having 
what exactly did you have in mind 
what error message is given  i can try to reproduce  do the fonts that break have anything in common   all definitely do have small caps  for example  
did you try using it with  italicfeatures  option 
do you have the directory  doc files   any way  you can’t typeset the documentation with  pdflatex   if you just want to extract the   sty  files  call  tex fontspec dtx

can you come up with a test project  modify the demo to exhibit this  
should work   http   stackoverflow com questions 14550765 mbprogresshud blocking user interaction are you sure it's not something on your side  does it work in the demo   
how have you added the class to your project  source files  library or cocoapods  
how does it even compile  mbprogresshud uses uikit 
does it get called  it does for me using 
what is the crash  please fix the code formatting as well 
does this fix your issue  https   github com jdg mbprogresshud pull 349
could you share it 
maybe try to contact apple and point them to the source of this library

does this fix your issue  https   github com jdg mbprogresshud pull 349
could you share it 
maybe try to contact apple and point them to the source of this library 
how can this bee reproduced  which version of mbprogresshud are you using 
how can i reproduce it  is this reproducible in the demo app 
what kind of crash did you get  please provide additional details 
can you provide a way to reproduce this 
can you be more specific or write a failing test case 
do you have a way to reproduce this issue 
how does this relate to  mbprogresshud  
could you please post me an example of a whois answer that returns true 
can you please provide the domain name that generated that error 
what is the domain name 
can you give me one or two domains where you are experiencing this behavior 
do you mind to continue the discussion there 
does this error happen when you are using the jruby openssl gem  http   jruby org openssl
what do you think 
maybe retry  i haven't had any luck duplicating this locally so i'm not sure why that would be coming up for you 
what ruby and operating system are you using 
what version of ruby  i would guess it probably really isn't supported  if you pass  nonblock    false as an option it should not warn 
what operating system are you on  what version of openssl 
what excon and ruby are you using 
would you be interested in digging in to help fix it  i'd certainly be happy to answer questions and help out 
what do you think 
should we use rewind instead of pos  and should we just rescue nil again  what do you think 
could the server be misconfigured in such a way that it might be erroneously including this 
what do you think 
does that sound like it could match your case  perhaps we don't actually need to force_encode here  but we didn't think it would be harmful  at least in most cases  
could you take a peek  looks like we are missing a rescue on one of the ewouldblocks somewhere probably  a bit more stacktrace evidence over on #440 also  thanks 
what do you think  would you be up for a quick pull to try that  thanks 
what do you think the proper behavior should be in that case  how often does it come up  thanks 
could you describe the desired usage a bit so i can make sure we are on the same page  thanks 
how often are you seeing this  is it possible there was or is an issue on the mandrill side 
do you use vcr  it integrates with this stuff  so might be a culprit anyway 
does that make sense  thoughts 
what do you think 
maybe it should be something more specific to avoid potential collisions  ie something like   excon_end_response_block   what do you think  would you be up for working on a patch  thanks 
what do you think 
does that clarify sufficiently 
would you be up for working on a pull request to add this  thanks 
does that all make sense  what do you think 
do you have thoughts on explicitly fixing this  or do you think working around it  as per the linked issues   is the better solution for now  thanks 
could you include the code snippet you are using to setup excon as well  just so i can be sure we are on the same page there  thanks 
does that make sense  what do you think  is that change sufficient for your needs 
where are you viewing rendered docs   want to make sure we are looking at the same thing   also  would you be interested in helping us fix this  thanks 
could you try that and or let me know what connection options you are using that result in the error so i can duplicate  thanks 
what do you think 
does that help and make sense 
could you supply an example of what headers might look like to ensure i know what you intend before getting too far into this  thanks 
does that provide what you need  or am i misunderstanding

maybe this is duplicate of #255  
what version have you installed  i am only maintaining  3 0 0 rc  and  i18n js setup  seems to come from  2 x

what version is this  i fixed the none issue a few days ago  the braces issue is part of the outputter i need to track down
do you mean  pkg latest    pkg installed  does not use looseversion  if so  this may be issue #388 which has been fixed in git 
did you include the  etc salt roles file in the minion config with the include statement  and are you running 0 9 7 
when you say "installing the package manually worked" were you using the exact same command as salt  or a different command 
can you give that a try 
does that workaournd work for you 
what do you think 
does the problem still occur if you have an include statement in initscripts sls  i e  include    sensu gem you're ultimately including everything  but maybe the order matters

do you mean a salt call that actively modifies the configuration file  or just one off configuration changes like    local  or similar 
do you have a suggestion for how it could be better named

do you agree with this  nachness  
can you confirm this  including the exact log message  deleting the private key ip address  would be helpful for confirming what is going on 
could you look for a related stack trace in the salt minion logs  something like   grep  b1  a10 traceback  var log salt salt_minion  on the affected minion 
what is your output of  salt   versions    also what is are the command s  you run when seeing this behavior  thanks 
can you try defining it there first and designating it in the profile 
can you check to see if this works under python3 
does it happen with  python2  and  matplotlib  1 5 
can this wait until next week for me to look at it 
can you try adding a  delete m_interpreterdock  to  applicationwindow  closeevent  https   github com mantidproject mantid blob master mantidplot src applicationwindow cpp#l9831  
should this be moved to r3 8 
can this read the q values from the workspace to do a sequential fit 
maybe you can fix the basis definition in the meantime 
what error are you seeing in workbench 
should i apply this to all other quoted setting values  such as direct beam  
how urgent is the fix required in master for this 
how does a delta function work  does it just scale the resolution  if so it would explain the shape because it has the x  range of the res function 
do you think you would be able to monitor the outcome of the fix 
could you please address this issue  you can check  teixeirawatersqe  https   github com mantidproject mantid blob master framework curvefitting src functions teixeirawatersqe cpp  for comparison
