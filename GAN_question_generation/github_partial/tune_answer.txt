doing that results in the same error  although it still seems dependent on the presence of field  u  and the method call to  get_s  
i just filed a bug because the compiler told me too  if you can't re produce then i really have no clue  i wasn't driving deep into debugging it 
 nagisa as far as i can see that pr would have exactly the same problem  generally  the source of problem lies in a fact that the calculation of new capacity is unaware on requirement that it should be less than std  isize  max  which is checked only later in alloc_guard   gankro the gnu libstdc++ works fine in this respect  it seems more like quality of implementation issue  than some strong requirement 
 sanmai nl look
sorry  i meant to include the command line  i was using 
my first thought was no  because swapping contexts needs direct access to the machine's registers  however  we already have set_registers and get_registers written in assembly  so we could probably write the swap function in llvm  if we do this  can we guarantee that llvm won't turn the call to set_registers into a tail call like is happening in the c version 
yep  this is now stable 
i was using rust incoming from yesterday
 uint    u8   etc  are already a big exception to the naming conventions  and i don't think that's a bad thing in those cases  
 thestinger you're welcome to remove it if you think it's a poor idea  my primary concern is that increasing the friction required to make use of options will simply result in them not being used at all  and since users can't implement this themselves  this is a decision that we have to make now 
not sure why i thought str  unsafe  from_bytes stopped at nulls  it's working as you described  i'm don't know why str  from_bytes adds null bytes to the string though  it says that it converts "bytes to a utf 8 string" and nulls are not valid utf 8  which gets back to my original point  why is the safe interface even providing methods for operating on byte arrays  it's not like you can safely do anything with an arbitrary byte sequence so why not be more explicit and more useful and have from_utf8 instead 
i remember myself using  get  and  unwrap  a lot and cringing every time i did   though looking back on it now  most of the cases could now be solved with  match move  to replace  is_some  and  unwrap   others would be replaced with oneshot closures   i dunno  i'm not sure it's worth more language features to track in the cases where you actually do need to be imperative about it 
that's right 
 cmr   yes it does work  so the  extern mod extra  line is not ignored  but i still find the error message on  use  misleading  i’ll update the issue title 
i can have a look  but i’m not one of the reviewers who can approve prs for merging into this repository 
 petrochenkov i think all of your example except the  # repr c    should be zero size  i don’t think it’s unexpected that a  repr  attribute changes the memory representation 
expanding the  try   macro 
i’ve realized that i can do this the other way around  which is even better  re export procedural macros from a library crate         although it would be nice for this issue to be fixed eventually  for me the above removes any desire to see it prioritized 
 jseyfried if i understand correctly  something  is  inefficient but what needs to change to fix it is in rustc rather than in my code 
could there a be a fast er  path for "trivial"  'static  borrows of literals 
all the  ll size_of   in  trans  machine   for one   t_array   there are probably more i'm not thinking of right now 
that makes the function compile  but it makes it quite unuseful for the caller  it means that any caller of  scan    is committing to the  transaction  being borrowed for as long as the lifetime of the  store  reference within  for example  a function like   also the error message here isn't great either   "first borrow later used here" isn't really pointing at the right thing because there _isn't_ a later use of the mutable borrow  it's only required by the types  
the header being included is   usr include unwind h   the line that is throwing the warning is inside an  #ifndef __freebsd__  directive  i'm running archlinux  which installs the headers for everything  i know that other distros often have a separate   dev  or   devel  package that has the headers 
whoops  i forgot about this issue  i    don't think it belongs into rfcs  i mean  its purely localized feature for the rustdoc doc generator  it has no effect on language semantic   or am i misremembering and the rfc repo is about any kind of feature to any part of rusts ecosystem   well  thinking about it again i guess it would affect how the doc ecosystem handles writing examples in general  but thats still kinda orthogonal since you still would use this feature on a case by case basis 
 in the second step  when i test for non existent opts  i've separated the call to  opt_present  from the call to  opts_present  because the former  fail s  as expected

i pushed a branch of my project demonstrating the issue on github  drbawb aqua 8e28dc4  you only need to build the  aqua web  crate to get the ice  which has much fewer dependencies than the main crate   i'll try to work on a more minimal repro than that  but hopefully it's a start

sure  here it is  i'm not sure how to compile rustc so i get the line numbers  so there are very few of those present 
i was thinking that    run  would be composable with other arguments  since  rustc   test  already exists  the usage for testing benchmarking would look like this 
 alexcrichton my  rustc  is only 2 days old  i can try updating  but i didn't think there were any relevant changes recently  that log provides nothing interesting  the very first reference to either "foo" or "fℇℇ" is the error  this is emitted immediately after it successfully reads  libnative 83574243 0 11 pre dylib  
it's garbage  it points to the call to the intrinsic  which is in std  cast
oh  that is a very good point  thanks  this is not nearly as obvious as i thought  i was assuming that the data pointer would be printed  but if you see any possible downside to implementing that  then i'll be entirely satisfied with transmuting to traitobject and printing the data field for myself 
to implement this change  is it possible to just add the macro syntax extension twice  once under the new name  and then migrate all instances after a snapshot 
i'm not sure and here's the reason  in #19035  today's coherence rules don't allow the correct trait impls to define addition multiplication both ways  what made me react in this bug was that the trait impls are accepted by the compiler  but the operator still doesn't work 
not certain how i missed the existing issues when searching for it  i suspect i accidentally had it filtered to only open issues  ah well  i still think it should be done  but this issue is not necessary 
i poked around a tiny bit last night but didn't find a repo  i'd imagine that it'd just be "link against a ton of crates with a syntax one somewhere in the middle"  i can try to make another repro tonight 
this happens   which seems like it's could be right  but i certainly don't understand well enough to judge yet 
that explains it  i just want to add that  format  "     "        where     denotes any character is basically a no op  you have to also specify the width for both the filling character and the alignment spec to take effect

 est31 thanks for checking  👍 indeed changing the abi fixes the problem  i certainly would have preferred a compilation error over silent bloat  closing as a duplicate of #9307 
obvious one  find replace in big files or stdin 
 manishearth add a check to  projected_ty  to not normalize if there are escaping regions 
in the code that caused the error i am importing from a library i am building  but if i copy paste the library code into the file  i get  error  cannot determine a type for this local variable  unconstrained type  instead  basically what i have  _this does not reproduce the compiler error_  
the workaround was to have the "null" field be empty string instead  not very satisfactory  i ended up not needing the option   field in my struct so haven't worked on this issue  i just tried the latest version of rustc to see how it works now  but got caught in a endless cycle of compiler errors that i didn't have enough motivation to wade through 
this shouldn’t be fixed by #19413  i explicitly didn’t fix it because i suspect it’s not going to be easy and  with unboxed closures  will be irrelevant anyway 
the 2nd has the same problem   expected concrete lifetime  is 'a as defined on the block at 6 45   it still needs a break   here  https   www reddit com r rust comments 2lkk4i concrete_lifetime_vs_bound_lifetime   is some discussion of this type of error however the error is still unclear  which is a bound and which is concrete  what do the terms actually mean  the error is also kinda odd because 
i have no idea  i've tried  grep  r 'transform  scalex' rust_src  and it always comes up empty except for where the book uses it  maybe the nightly docs folder needs to be erased before the next doc set is built  i'm trying rebuilding the docs to see if it helps so we'll see 
i can't reproduce it either 
 nick29581 i pretty much agree with your thinking here    it should be a lang item in the long run  but welding it to a path for now should allow us to future proof that change   and no core scenarios are not considered stable anyway    i think running without core is very unusual  because core imposes so few constraints   we do need to stabilize the various structs so that people can provide custom impls of traits for them  and so on  but i agree that making it a lang item should be a fine change  especially since no core is not considered stable  cc  alexcrichton

it's because the it doesn't ignore comments  there is invalid syntax in the comment 
it doesn't exist in the standard library that comes with the distribution 
 arielb1 of course this cannot work  i have a single use case namely  to calculate the difference between the current program counter and the position the linker assumed the program counter to be  in os dev this can then be used to create the page tables with the correct virtual to physical address mapping  the advantage of usize is that the static doesn't have to be mut because usize is sync  it's not that big of an issue

yep  i have seen it a few times there as well and have been back and forth on trying to use incremental compliation on it  i'd guess the frequency is related to code size though as it does not appear as often 
 these are on a different machine so numbers won't be comparable to the ones above  ## env rustflags  ccodegen units 1 cargo_incremental 0 ### rustc 1 17 0 nightly  62eb6056d 2017 02 15   so a single codegen unit seems to help a bit but it is still slower than it could be  i thought about codegen units briefly when testing but never tested it as the cargo docs seem to imply that they are already set to 1    https   doc rust lang org cargo reference manifest html#the profile sections   yeah that was just my bad  forgot i had it enabled when running the benchmarks     would be nice if it wasn't a 2x slowdown still but i get that might not be possible to improve much 
does   enable debug not do that  maybe it should by default 
 alexchandel the problem is that using       where it doesn't make sense usually produces an error  for instance this won't compile   so it's not very coherent

 kennytm good to know  i wasn't aware of that  this came up in the context of another issue  and the sample code provided for that issue  i do think it makes sense for this lint to exist  somewhere   and i'm glad to hear that it exists in clippy  i'd love to see it in rustc so that it's available by default  but if that's not desirable for some reason  fair enough 
 retep998 interesting question  the non native path types wouldn't necessarily be compatible with the native os string types  which would make it difficult to reuse the code between them  doing this thoroughly might require providing non native  osstring   osstr  types as well  that seems useful as well  though   also  all of these shouldn't take up any space in programs that don't use them  
especially since we've already  gone out of our way to prevent other ambiguities  https   github com rust lang rfcs pull 520  
 bkoropoff yes  this definitely looks to be a duplicate  the small code sample in #17655 matches up with the code in dckc rust sqlite3 that i eventually found to be the cause  for completeness  though 
i have installed  multirust  and then nightly via it  1 4 has been just successfully installed 
 string    str   or something else  but after deep consideration  i think it doesn't matter  sorry about that 
this issue happened by mixing the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of rust and and gcc 
i managed to reproduce the error in the rust play pen  http   is gd trqc8f  i will copy the snippet here anyway 
these errors are fine  the idea of this issue is to just make sure the code always fails to compile  more errors are fine  too  the const let feature has a bug where even enabling it will still report it  that's not problematic for this issue  can you add a comment to the test mentioning that this test should never ever succeed  if you want you can additionally try to minimize the test to something still emitting the feature gate error even though the feature gate is active  and maybe to something that should be perfectly fine at compile time   then open a new issue about that 
yes  that's what inspired this optimization idea

i only hit it as i was experimenting and didn’t quite bother saving the source code  here’s another case i just wrote up 
primary benefit is an ability to target  rustc  at stuff other than the list of targets we currently hardcode if llvm is not distributed by us  linked dynamically by distro or something  
i’m telling what i’m seeing on my system  it only runs run pass tests on one core for me and nothing else  i e  only one core is maxed   i haven’t gotten past the run pass tests to see if the test runner would even try to run the other tests because i have test failures in  run pass backtrace debuginfo aux rs  and  run pass mod_file_aux rs  which i haven’t investigated yet 
relevant line is a part of  does still result in the same error      for now  i just specified  llvm config  for 32 bit version of llvm i have  which works 
amusing  i was not able to reproduce this on my recent w10 vm  but i’m fairly confident i had hit this with the more ancient versions of windows  closing for now as inapplicable 
a proxy is the same type while arguments type and return type are the same  thus makes it possible to write a  if  while both arms are closures  other than  if    match  arms can benefit from it  too 
the ice that i reported above is occurring on  1 23 0   stable   which is a little different  and the circumstances do not involve rustfmt  but it is the same line of code that's crashing  and they could be related 
didn't work
does this need anything else to be a complete tracking issue  this is a relatively minor feature  so there's no rfc or anything to reference 
to teach people that instead of  format  "  "  foo   they can also write  foo to_string     this was motivated by https   twitter com yoshuawuyts status 1051394862023495680
well i was hoping that someone could tell me whether  utils  is required for musl builds  or if its presence in the linker flags is a mistake  having looked into it  it seems to be the case that  libutils  for musl is just an empty library  but is still required in case we're linking with c code which expects to be able to link to it  so probably we should be including  libutils  as part of the rust package 
it's fixed in later nightly  closing  i tried  on a side note  sadly  it improved build time in release time only from 5 13 to 5 07  which even might be fluctuation 
hm  the  contributing guide  https   github com rust lang rust blob master contributing md  suggests that running tests on stage 1 is okay  i suppose that all tests should always pass but the ones which aren't run on every pr tend to bitrot  definitely need to try this with another llvm version  still waiting for the compile to finish   
thanks for confirming  and yes  my bad  i must have been too hasty in checking the  src   dirs here

 lonami i'm not sure i understand the question in relation to the proposal   core  convert  infallible  is an existing type that acts as a stand in for the never type  since the never type itself is still unstable  core apis like  tryfrom  already use  infallible   i'm proposing an unwrapping  fn  on  result  that is specific to dealing with  core  convert  infallible   and later  when it's stable  the never type 
yes  looking at my dropbox while i edit  it's the sublime plugin  sorry 
nope  no warnings were generated 
i share your concerns about this and i don't know its impact   into  into  is already  # inline   and a one liner so i wouldn't be surprised if it is already being inlined almost anywhere anyways  i don't think any of my proposed solutions is good enough though  those were only some of the ideas i had that could work   and i'd very much prefer a solution without downsides 
the thing is const generics don't know where the usize comes from  so they could try to do something with it that is not allowed if it is just a pointer address  until monomorphization we can't know if there is an issue  note that converting a pointer to an usize and back just to be able to put it in const  statics  or use it with const generics  is a real pain  we would be better off in this case with an  atomicptr t   type  such that i can write  atomicptr fn    i32   and avoid the conversion to usize  for const generics  c++ accepts function pointers at the type level and that works just fine with clang  so i expect  fn bar const ptr  fn    i32        to work fine as well 
ah  sorry  it's been a while since i last contributed  i will move it to the suggested repo

the title should be edited then  and btw  the quickest non permanent solution looks like this   rustflags ' c link args  lffi'

the proposal was absolutely not general  i really was suggesting only that the particular case where a function dereferences its pointer arguments might be sufficiently low hanging fruit to be worth doing  of course you are welcome to disagree  or to reject the idea for any of a million reasons  but i'm sorry to see this closed because of a misunderstanding about what it intended to say 
is it possible to use   cforce frame pointers off  to forcefully disable them again  if so  i think there's not much harm in enabling them by default for these targets  at most  we'll pay for a bit of stack space since lr is saved slightly more often  as well as slightly higher register pressure  i think 
 i have to point out that i've only just started with rust   so if i get you right i should have dereferenced  tests last   unwrap    before calling clone and that would have been a compiler error because it doesn't use the clone impl's for  t  maybe like so  let test   test   tests last   unwrap    let test  test     test  clone   
we are using not rust's fork of llvm for this  yes  i'll have to investigate further later

 arielb1   it's a totally fair question  for me it's about having a mental model that's simple to explain for how ownership works after you've handed off ownership of your data  like  bluss shows  the current behavior is a mix of errors and non errors  depending on what you're doing  i think a simpler mental model might be something like "after you hand off ownership  any read or write to the data will error " currently  it's something more like "after you hand off ownership  any read will fail and any write will appear to succeed but will not update the value you've handed off  instead  it updates an invisible copy you can not read  also  any update  eg  push x  or drop  will fail"
 crypto universe   looks like this one is currently set to   yossi k  i'll let them chime in here if they want to take this one or not  there's a list here  https   github com rust lang rust issues 35233 where you can see which ones are free  i just added more if you want to grab a free one 
 paulfanelli   yeah  there's a quirk in the unit test system where it will only start testing the labels if you add at least one note to the test  you can read up on it in the extra credit section of the  blog post  http   www jonathanturner org 2016 08 helping out with rust errors html 
because in a  layout  the size does not necessarily have to be a multiple of the alignment  but in a rust type this is always the case 
 durka i downloaded https   static rust lang org dist rust 1 8 0 i686 unknown linux gnu tar gz and found it there  didn't go out of my way to search where that readme comes from 
i don't think so  items which have been  drain ed  and thus shouldn't be accessible  have been protected by  empty_bucket   none of the invariants of   table rs   are being broken  which is where any  unsafe  code lives   just robin hood hashing invariants in   map rs   
msvc comes with a  proprietary  tool for producing  lib from  def  and  def from  dll  if you're missing the prior  most other compilers targeting windows actually lack this facility  requiring reliance on msvc's toolchain  the rationale is twofold    first  removing a dependency on a specific toolchain  for instance  a file with the appropriate idata section could be compiled with llvm and linked with lld without needing an additional runtime or libraries    second  without this  the  kind "dylib"  hint is superfluous  since the behavior is identical to  kind "static"   at least when targeting windows  i haven't tested how the behavior is when targeting mac or linux yet 
ok  but there doesn't seem to be a way to _intentionally_ include lines beginning with a single hash  either with  ##  or with   #   both interpolate that literal string into the output 
 alexcrichton its doing "building stage1 test artifacts" now  didn't do it before 
 ishitatsuyuki my use case has some components  including the tests  written in c  while others are written in rust  for the tests  i took the original c tests and integrated them as cargo tests  so that i can run them using the superior cargo tooling  multiple threads  better output  etc    for the  sys crate  i don't really run bindgen  and in fact the c component calls into the rust component  i try to avoid calling the other way round where possible 
there is already a link in the rustdoc of the traits to the second edition of the book  while covering a wide range of topics regarding closures  i only see a description of what the traits represent  but not which one you should use for your apis and why  also  the section of the book seems to not contain any info on the  why   my first point  
my first attempt was to create a new target  armv5te unknown linux gnueabi mk   but this fails because my host  arch linux  rust compiler backend does not include such a target  my second attempt was to replace the existing  arm unknown linux gnueabi mk  target with   finally  it works    i am very new to rust and i will be happy about any comments or suggestions  furthermore  i would be glad if we can have a armv5 te  target with soft float supported by rust  my next attempt will be to cross compile using the musl library  instead of glibc  
this came up while reviewing https   github com rust lang rust pull 30776  i haven't seen a specific issue  but  eefriedman pointed out that i wasn't modelling the powerpc64 abi completely  the test case in c was   i'm not sure why x86_64 isn't annotating the llvm ir with signext here

hello  alexcrichton  thanks for replying 
you are right  it has been fixed in the lastest nightly build  thank you

yeah  thanks   cargo clean  fixes the problem  if it's a duplicate i'll close it 
i think not will be helpful  i'm not sure it's easy to do  but i'll try 
before the   crate  change  it produced syntactically valid rust code even if the semantics were different in the case of hygiene collisions  this was useful for debugging purposes as  nagisa points out  since the   crate  change  it produces syntactically invalid code which i consider a bug

 oli obk my crate is not public  it has a lot of private code  but it does have these flags on  lib rs    i could give you a copy of the code through private means if that helps 
 bstrie everything in  libcore  is also in  libstd   more or less   libcore  is just a smaller version of  libstd  that doesn't rely on platform specific behaviour at all  i do think that  libstd  should be audited for types that can be moved to  libcore   this is just one case of that 
it does not panic on latest nightly or beta 
ok  i implemented a prototype fix   it's available  here  https   github com joshlf once fork issue   i copied the  once  module wholesale into the repo and did the fix there   it needs to be cleaned up and commented  but i've verified that it works   sfackler i'll look into the  pthread_once_t  question 
i have a library which is used to safely operate on memory which is shared with another  untrusted process  we have to assume that the foreign process may be arbitrarily modifying the memory while we're operating on it  making normal memory accesses unsound  volatile allows us to ensure that the compiler doesn't make any unsound optimizations with respect to reads or writes from to the memory  more details  here  https   fuchsia review googlesource com c garnet + 229382

hi  alex  thanks for your quick reply  i expected that the number of requested threads could be parsed out of the environment variable  makeflags   but sadly no   yep  that works just fine for me  so i run  configure  as before and then run    x py build  j12  
i don't know  one weird thing is that i had two functions   rustc told me that  sub_handle  needed named lifetimes  i satisfied that complaint   request  'a request    but i believe i should have been told about that in  handle  also  and i haven't 
i was under the impression that the  result  tuple included a backtrace  i now understand that is not the case  and certain error types include their own backtrace functionality 
i'm not sure  it's an insanely minimal environment  let me try 
 cjgillot  go ahead   
sorry  i don't think i have it anymore  by 'ignores stuff' i meant that    x py dist   install  seem to ignore  dist   install  part and just does the same what  build  would do 
sure thing  my bad if that i filled it in the wrong place   
what do you mean expected  it’s clearly confusing from a user’s perspective    
this was a clean checkout  but i'll give it a try asap

predictability of the behavior  in some very specific conditions  when i allocate 32 mb vecdeque  i don’t want to unexpectedly be 64 mb  the current  api  doesn’t let me to control this  cause the actual capacity to be allocated is hidden in the implementation details  now  the proposed api would  without exposing the actual allocation logic  will give me the ability to make the code allocate memory more precisely 
i've copied the std implementations onto godbolt and added the specialization  as expected  it improves the generated code a lot  you're right   scottmcm  with switched branch order it produces

backtrace from gdb 
sorry  i cannot provide the codebase  therefore  please  close the issue 
ah ha  but users before 1 30 can't use it in core  i think it should get a new stable since tag 
hmm  it lets me implement what i need  and solves what i asked for in the title  thanks for the suggestion  that it requires to wrap my definition into the macro invocation  i e   doc_comment  "   "  struct foo     is a little annoying  but i think it can't be helped  writing  # my_doc quote  ""    does not work  so there is currently no hope to implement doc comment as an attribute macro 
i can try today in the evening  but i wont be successful with a 99  guarantee as i am dependant on multiple nightly requiring crates  such as  relm  https   github com antoyo relm  
modified issue description  it depends on  fmt_macros  but the error is basically the same 
 hellow554 could you show an example  as far as i can tell when you import an identifier with  use   you cannot create another with the same name  because that would redefine the symbol  so if your code has  use std  rc  rc  you can write  rc   and if an error occurs for that use  the error message could just show  rc   maybe some consideration needs to be made for how imports happen within macros  that's not exactly clear to me

😞  i was just trying to reproduce it again  but couldn't  apparently the issue was that changing the flag wouldn't cause proper re compilation  so  cargo clean  solved the problem  sorry  so this is now a re compilation issue  for some reason in  release  it would always re compile properly when changing this flag  but in  development  it wouldn't  i'm not sure how it behaves on other operating systems  but in windows both  dev  and  release  builds produce the debug info as a seperate file  obviously in  release  mode we have to define  debug   true   otherwise there won't be any debuginfo to begin with   cargo toml  
my code had rewrite  this is another error   they are similar  https   play rust lang org  version stable mode debug edition 2018 gist 701196c653a5818b4caacc00d68a885f  url 
i didn't give this a second thought but you're right  anyways what i wanted to highlight is the idea behind the example 
not sure if i did it the right way  i set  rustflags " csave temps  ccodegen units 1"   environment variable  here's the complete target directory  i hope it is included  https   dev gentoo org  whissi stuff fd 7 2 0_target_201901252245 tar xz
this workstation runs f29 with ext4  not a remote location  but there is a remote authentication  ldap  for logging in   but i don't think the compiler needs to log in as another user  does it  i have another workstation which is again a fedora29  but no ldap there  i did not try this code on that computer yet  so  the error happened again while re compiling my code  it's very easy to make it pop out    it happens most of the times   what is curious is that  this time  the code is not in my local project directory   after running  cargo build  a couples of time  it compiled with no issues  and the attrs for that file are unchanged  also  i did a couple of changes to the code and tried again  now  some files in my project directory had the issue  like   home myself myproject target debug deps libsimplecss 18f82e94def39f38 rlib  or  myproject 6f031011e6caecc5 27c9ol3y5xg01ywg rcgu o   but the attributes are the same as the one above 
great  thank you 
weird  yesterday i could reproduce it multiple times  now i can't  and i get the set same result as in the playground 
 hellow554 yup  here it is
its also rather redundant in the context of a   pre   where all you need to add a line feed is       or equivalent  i mean  you're already doing horizontal alignment with literal whitespace 
hi  jonas schievink  thanks for your feedback  depending on a tiers party is always a tricky choice that needs to be carefully evaluated  i believe the main topics to look at are cost  privacy  dependency and availability  docsearch has been created 4 years ago as a giveback to the community  as you noticed  the service is provided by algolia which as a strong relation with open source  we only ask the project to display the algolia logo at the bottom of the opened dropdown  there is no hidden cost  it's free  about the data  algolia gives the owners the possibility to learn more about the search usage through its dashboard but every queries are anonymized  users are safe  concerning the offline support  we are not covering this use case and most of the time the search is just made unavailable when browsing the online documentation offline  algolia does provide some tools for handling this  but we don't support it yet  it's i believe an advanced ux case  docsearch is relaying on algolia's infrastructure which is handling some heavy load on big ecommerce websites where the search feature is crucial  on the availability part  we you got you covered     implementing docsearch is just few lines of js  the product is not perfect yet but we are aiming the state of the art with the help of the community  basically if your users don't like it  removing it or contributing to improve it would be easy  also we do free support  all day long  i'd be happy to ear more about your concerns on those points

the  not a lot of  code is at  https   github com 95th btrs i myself cant reproduce with the same code now   i tried cargo clean once and now it doesnt ice 
the program stops before it can print a backtrace  and i don't think it's panic related because upon further testing  the same access violation occurs even with  i   0    which should be valid and produces no error or panic when run without the flags  that being said  here's the backtrace for  i   1  without the flags set

that file does exist  i'm using python 3 7 2 installed via  pyenv  
it was quite basic  something like  removing the   await  fixed the problem  making a syntax error fixed the problem  but guessing compilation quit before the panic 
sorry  i misunderstand the rust rules  it not works as i expected
 the8472 maybe in wrappers around toolchain executables  that's one reason why i was thinking of doing it at rustup level since there are already wrappers defined there  doing that in the parent shell environment is not a good idea as you still have to rely on  some  system executables and that might break them 
looks fixed on the nightly  closing 
yes  but calling refresh before ever index operation would have a very high performance penalty  hence not really a feasible solution when performance is a concern 
it works on single node cluster for me and it recreates it consistently  i tried on 2 and 3 nodes cluster but it does not recreate it  please use single node only 
the search request should hit document 1047855828  there's a comment in the curl script pointing to the correct one   sorry about the verbosity 
ok  it looks good now  i reset my entire index and ran through the testcase multiple times and it passed every time  thanks 
thanks for playing around  i'm in the middle of deploying based on 0 16 x at the moment  having worked around both these bugs using  lats and  lons in js   i'll make a note to go back and try the mvel version when i move up a version for my next release  feel free to close this  and i'll reopen if it's still an issue then 
hello  s1monw   let me walk through the motivation here  lets say   i am running the following query  as you can see the score by field_value_factor is always shadowing the score given by random_score   as in random_score has no relevance here  my motivation for this issue came from this problem  one solution would be to use the weight to normalize the values   and that is how its currently done  but then looking into the range of values for each function and deciding the weight score for all the functions and finding them manually seems like a hard case  and these weights that are computed manually might not be applicable across all documents  the percentage suggestion was based on this   but i am finding it difficult to pen the maths behind the same  only solution i found was to find the range of each score given by each function across all document and use that for percentage influence  but as scoring is per document   that wont be feasible  let me know your thoughts on the subject 
 jpountz   i know this is being debated on another issue  but i badly want the ability to decide if the filter needs to be cached or not cached with me itself  depending on my client   free or paid     his usage   the volume of data he is going to search etc   we make decision for enabling caching or not on the set of keywords   kept in another document and looked up using terms lookup filter   he is going to search  you can think this for situations like   when a client logs in   before he makes any search   we plan to cache his filter so that when he search the performance is good  when he logs out   we remove the filter too  similarly we have other use cases too  hence kindly make expose querycachingpolicy via a flag or configuration or something   or provide the pluggability so that we can do it ourself 
the aim is immutability  perhaps i can describe our use case a little bit more in detail  if we change the structure of the index  the complete index has to be recreated  during recreating the new index  we don't want that new documents are added to the old index to make sure  all new documents are added to the new index after creating it  one option would be to disable indexing on all our servers  but we would prefer to be able to set this on the server side  so we can make sure that not servers add documents by accident and we don't have these documents in the new index  because of the fact that shay mentioned in the forum  i assume there won't be any performance gain 
we're running the master branch  commit ed99a51406ab5fd8dcc626dc90f408559d57e3c1 
i figured it was due to caching  i don't have an immediate need for different modes but i was thinking of it more for an "and" mode 
nothing appeared to be removed actually  it's just that the indexes seemed to have issues upon restart  i did initially have logstash start up with elasticsearch embedded and try to multicast join this instance  i thought unsuccessfully   however i built logstash with es 0 19 2 and not 0 18 x  you can see the patch that i applied here if you want    https   github com arimus log processing blob master rpmbuild sources logstash_amqp09_queuefix patch all that said  if an index does get into a corrupt  even partially  state  is there any way to repair it or do you just need to delete it  it appeared that despite the log messages with errors  the index was still happily being updated and was searchable  it's didn't seem completely foobar'd  which is why i assumed there might be something to go in and do some form of consistency check on it 
so maybe this is a group discussion instead of an issue  but from what i read filters are good and queries are bad when you don't care about scores  yes you can wrap queries to convert to filters  but then you have to know enough about setting cache options and such  also its not clear if i am anding multiple things if i can wrap the bool or if i should wrap each wildcard inside of the bool  i'm guessing i should have multiple query filters since those are cached separately filter         query   bool   should   wildcard     wildcard        vs filter      bool   should   query   wildcard      query  wildcard          also there are already some queries that have matching filters  regexp for example  so it confuses me why all queries aren't also filters  there is probably some philosophy or nuance i'm missing  but if regexp has a filter seems like wildcard should also  finally it just feels wrong     if there aren't benefits to "natural" filters then when have them at all  couldn't everything just be wrapped   note i'm converting user input using my own dsl to json  these aren't canned queries  
not really    there are cases where we may see a little blip in the network that trigger the shard reallocation  i think its a pretty worth while feature to say "wait 5m for things to settle before re allocating shards"  this is also useful for cases where you may be bringing up more than 1 additional node in terms of capacity 
if i call  tostring  on  searchresponse  i get a very big json which i have no intention or parse it  ideally i would like to get fields as string per  searchhit  only 
yes i downloadd it from github and trying to execute it directly   i want to run elasticsearch locally to index stuff from my experiment app

 martijnvg what's the correct way to check these values  i've temporarily disabled out parent child search but can turn it back on to get them  using _cluster stats shows  without having run a parent child query in a while  if this is the right way to test i can run it again both before and after running one 
nice support   rm  rf elastics   if you ever decide to document your project i may look at it again  probably not  tip  make instructions are typically put in the readme for us old timers
should work but i would argue it's still a workaround  just like  in  is a synonym for  terms   es could automatically translate the query from  match  to  terms   the user doesn't always know the values passed are numbers or that the target field is numeric hence why applying the workaround would require additional calls and effort 
i agree it's not common but a valid case nevertheless  i've encountered this in some uis 
elasticsearch highlighting problem  0 90 1  i am working on upgradion of elasticsearch from 0 20 2 to 0 90 1 and come across the following issue  elasticsearch highlighting was working fine getting results as we expected  in 0 20 2  but the same doesn’t work in es 0 90 1 "type"  "pattern"  steps to reproduce the issue environment  jdk 1 7 windows 7  elasticsearch 0 90 1  used elasticsearch head plugin to create query documents step 1   defined mappings and settings for index test_hightlight  type hightlight   http   localhost 9200 test_hightlight  post    "settings"    "index"    "number_of_shards"  6  "number_of_replicas"  2  "analysis"    "analyzer"    "commaanalyzer"    "type"  "pattern"  "flags"  "dotall"  "lowercase"  "true"  "pattern"  "  "  "stopwords"  "_none_"            "mappings"    "hightlight"    "properties"    "documentname"    "analyzer"  "commaanalyzer"  "type"  "string"    "description"    "analyzer"  "commaanalyzer"  "type"  "string"           step2  indexed following documents to newly created index     note  the same query is working as we expected with elasticsearch 0 20 2
so is the plan to fix the  6 8 5  tar file or to release a  6 8 6  version 
yeah  the queries vary quite a bit  there are likely over 100 unique queries across the platform   we use them both interactively based on user initiated searches and also programatically to find various objects  here is an example of a query that i recently rewrote to use the elasticsearch java apis   when this particular query is run  we also run anywhere from 5 50 other queries in parallel at the same time  the reason we run so many queries in parallel is that our legacy search system was not very expressive  so it was necessary to use a lot of queries to express some of the more complicated queries  we'll also be looking into rewriting these queries to use the elasticsearch apis in the near future  i can also provide our mappings if you like as well  they are specified in a single json file  
i'd argue that just having 0 90 6 is still not clear enough  i understand that both 0 90 and master refer to documentation of not yet released software  imho 0 90 should properly reflect that fact and say something like 0 90 dev   ideally the documentation would be provided for every past release  to a certain point back   current 0 90 dev and master     or something like that 
works now for me too         
running this on osx  i believe i only have 1 version of java installed  it is 1 7 0_17 client is embedded es 0 90 2 configured to run as client only with no local data  server is standalone cluster with roughly default configuration  aside from cluster name  
oops  seems you're right  i was correlating logs to the wrong cluster  sorry for the mixup 
version    number  "0 90 2"  snapshot_build  false  lucene_version  "4 3 1"   
btw  third node is doing rebalancing too  can you explain how best distribution for an index could change after another index is deleted  link to an issue with discussion could help too  my understanding of placement policy was "evenly distribute shards between nodes taking disk space into account"  this way if index is deleted it might be a good idea to move a some shards if some disk usage disbalance threshold is violated 
yes  i do  is it documented somewhere 
of course  sorry for the late answer  the problem is that we can have quite large  several 100mb  data for a single field in a document  so passing or receiving this data with apache http async client will be a problem because of memory consumption for buffering the object  apart you could    run in limitation like timeouts or body size  therefore we are using good ol' sync client instead of async and we provide input or output streams as parameter or response so that memory consumption is way lower  apart  at least in our case this is helpful  we can use libraries that will process such a result stream but couldn't handle a data object of that size  so basicly what would help us would be an option to perform a sync request instead of async and at least get an output stream as result instead of the whole object  providing data via input stream would be even better    does that make sense to you and would this be useful in a more general context 
sorry david i don't get you  elasticsearch lang groovy is a plugin for es to have scripts running onver es  no   i just want a  working groovy api  http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch client groovy api 0 90 _preface html  similar to java api    it's different no  
i'm running 0 90 2 
yes it did help me  but i think this might be something that should be made more explicit 
how could i get a full stacktrace where the excception occurs 
trying to make up an hypothetical example here  looking at https   www otto de  you can enter both  some free text query as well as article numbers  e g  found in printed catalogs   having seen nothing but the user interface i have no idea how this is actually implemented  but i could imagine systems like these to have some logic in the application that tries to identify user queries  search intents that look like article numbers and use a different template for retrieving results for that from the index compared to the template used for all other queries  the only way to come up with an estimate answer to the question "given a random user comes to our site  how well does our search perform " is to sample a mix of both  queries for article numbers and free text queries  being able to represent those as two templates in the rank eval request should make it easier to play around with how these queries are being translated to actual elasticsearch queries  makes any sense at all 
 javanna makes sense to me 
thanks  nik9000  i don't know if this is only for aggregations  but according to https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch guide current preload fielddata html#global ordinals  so if we update the index frequently and keep merging  we don't really give global ordinals the chance to build up  in theory then  if we extend  refresh_interval  we should be able to see the benefits from global ordinals  i tested this by setting  refresh_interval  to  120s —there was no difference in the response times

elastic won't necessarily be running  at the moment i am installing the plugin on startup   before elastic is started  my elastic config is all in code   so regular cmd line won't work 
the exception message contains the response body which described what is wrong at shard side  i replaced the error messages by dots in the paste  the problem is not what is wrong with the query  the point is we do not know where the wrong query is created at the client side source  i will try the 2 0 later 
i'm running 1 2 1  the strange thing is that my elasticsearch instance crashed running this query  i got   i restarted it and then the query was working properly 
the escape hatch config setting had changed name from version 6 3 so the previous setting name was taking no effect  one setting name for 60  to 6 2+ and a different name setting for 6 3+ this info has been added in the pr  https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 22073 i understand the reason we only use metadata to keep checks lightweight and the expense at scale of doing a search across every doc with a script or something that looks for dupe fields  one way to minimise this cost might be to use a random function score query across the data  it won't be perfect to ensure all docs are checked but in the cases where all or a sufficient majority of the docs are broken it will at least alert the user  in the cases where the dupe fields are rare then missing them at an upgrade check step might be much less impact  the fact that the escape hatch is workng as expected means the impact of this scenario is easy to deal with if a user upgrades and finds docs are affected  so this check might be added to an upgrade checklist in docs perhaps  it's probably also a rare edge case as it takes a custom indexing app to make the error of duplicating fields and i think many of the mainstream indexing tools will generally avoid this 
hi  martijnvg  thanks for reply  i will try the curl call later  and maybe i could describe our situation more detail first  we have an index named _info_ which includes a type name _message_  all the content is built into _info_ with type _message_  now the subscribe system needs to register query into a new index names _subscribe_ as a type _ percolator_  and this works fine  when we used percolator api  the api  curl  xget 'localhost 9200 indexname typethatdocwouldparsed _percolate'  d '  "doc"     "message"   "a new bonsai tree in the office"    '  the second parameters i would regard it as _the type that the doc would parsed_  so here we set it as _message_  but my question is   how the subscribe index know the type _message_ which includes in index _info_  is that means that i should build index manually and set mapping with type _message_ into _subscribe_  thanks  and i will test curl call today 
the source transform is going away in es 2 0 with #12674  so this is irrelevant  if the transform reappears in a plugin  then i hope that it gains this feature because anyone using the source transformation as it is today should make changes on the client side to fix the data rather than writing scripts  that will slow things down   to fix it on the other side  adding trigger like support adds support for use cases that aren't possible otherwise

 dakrone will send you a sample offline  i think we can choose a default  and also expose this as a configurable setting

it is happening in embedded node  i have already copied the icu installation jars from my production set up to the directory from where embedded node gets started  probably  the issue is that carrot2 is getting started even if it is not mentioned in the list of mandatory plugins 
thanks for this  one idea is to create _alias_ methods in querybuilders such as  or something like   etc    these methods would simply forward the input to the target method   wrapperquery    so they would only exist for clarity  if you can tolerate these extra convenience methods it might make it easier for someone to locate the method they need  or maybe there's a cleaner way someone will think of  or maybe it is just a documentation thing  i found it hard to locate the method i needed  thanks very much  matt
sorry  ill have to ask again  maybe im just confused     my problem  i have some  mustache files in the "config scripts" directory  i know how to access them via rest  thats no a problem  but i dont know the name of the templates  thats my problem  is there a way to access the available templates  in my case there are template1 mustache and template2 mustache and i want to get the 2 avaiable templates via rest  without knowing they are names template1 and template2  if this is possible  sure  this ticket is obsolet and can be closed    
the main use case i have in mind is performing top terms aggregations or significant terms aggregations to do keyword analysis on the text fields of the documents stored in our index  we use the  default language analyzers  http   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference 1 5 analysis lang analyzer html  for these text fields 
i'm on 1 3 1 
i put this in under scroll because it has the closest functionality of what i need  i have a setup where i need to query and receive back a fairly large data set  then set up pagination within that data set  i e  only display 100 results at a time for each page etc   the issue is  the return data is large enough to where we can't really keep the whole set in memory  and sorting the whole amount of data each time you query  just to get a set number of results at large "from" values will be taxing on the es server as well  so in my effort to fix this i noticed two things that were similar to the functionality i require  one of those is a filter with caching  this would just about be perfect except the setup will constantly be ingesting data and if those newly indexed items fall within that data set instead of at the end  the page  i e  from  size  could potentially be different  that's where scroll came in  it  as you said  stores a snapshot of the index at that time which is exactly what i need  only i can't offset what i want back  i e  start from a certain point  because it always returns the next "size" worth of data until the return set is empty  hopefully this cleared up my issue and feel free to ask any other information of me 
no  sorry i'm going to update the comment with the output of the first command 
ok for now to use the  timeout  parameter with a very low value  thanks 
sure  jasontedor  searched for an already created one  but couldn't find it 
it was mostly simple terms aggs but also one global agg with a filter  iirc the query itself was that same filter being applied to the global agg 
we are using "cluster routing allocation exclude _ip" to decommission the old nodes  we exclude the old nodes and wait till all the shards are available in the new ones  before shutting down the old nodes 
true  there appears to be a greater percentage of the recovery time is spent in the translog stage  yes  it's not 100  reproducible  but it does happen frequently  there are no exceptions in the logs that i have discovered  since i posted this  i done several rolling reboots and node failure recoveries of our clusters  with 1 3 4 vs 1 3 2  a full recovery has gone from  40 minutes to over 4 hours  prior to 1 3 4 i never paid any attention to pending_tasks  it's part of my problem triage process now  so i'm not able to do an apples to apples comparison  when _cat recovery does not show anything  pending_tasks will grow to over 2000 tasks while its stuck on a single task  usually its shard started that wasn't able to allocate to a node  some times i can cancel the allocation  most of the time the cancel would timeout as well and the cluster is left in a limbo waiting and waiting 
 brwe indeed  it does blow up without the  scale  parameter  i guess i did something weird last time  thanks 
after thinking a bit more  how about a simple mutable geopoint class that extends an immutable point base class  since we want to eventually support 3 or 4 dimensions this would give us both the read only protection we need for query state and the foundation for extending into higher dimensions   without creating a class for each dimension like other libraries do  e g   point2d  point3d   this would be very useful for coordinate reprojection and 3rd party plugin support

hi  dadoonet  here is the complete code that i am using to reproduce the issue   i am not deleting and then creating the index 
yes  that's the root url of the jcenter repo  it is a mirror for central and also includes packages by people like you and me  you can have your personal repo and have  your own packages included in jcenter  https   bintray com docs usermanual uploads uploads_includingyourpackagesinjcenter html  if they fulfill a few criterias  signing is not one of them  this lower entry barrier being the reason why i chose jcenter for my own packages   example  https   bintray com stackmagic maven    so it's a grand unified repo for everything maven  plus they can do debian repos and all kinds of stuff but that's not in the scope of this discussion  i guess  
yes i evened tried renaming the logs but it throws error saying this file is in use by other process which makes sense its used by es it self  when i shut down es then am able to rename the logs manually on the unc path  we are storing logs on unc path because we want all logs logged centrally on one path

i don't understand  i though these comments should be stored in the config files  and when the user invokes  _mapping  it will extract them from there  but apparently i am wrong 
you are right  it was the rss river plugin  thanks 
sorry for the delayed response  i am trying to search for a given string in the content of the file  say i have a file abc docx and it contains the word "shark" in it  if i search for "sha"  it returns the file abc docx  however  if i search for "shar"  it does not return that file i e it seems to process only 3 character search strings while doing content search  i checked this in the latest version 1 5 0  as well and it din't work either  this seems to be working in elasticsearch 1 4 2  please let me know if you need further inputs on this 
i am using es 1 4 2  i have set "index routing allocation total_shards_per_node"  "3"  so the number of the primary shards is almost the same  we create one index per day  and import today's data to it  every index has 89 shards and 1 replic  also  no search at the time 
oops  i set "index store type"  "memory" as you expect    thank you  for your advice
 zerocoolys thanks for your reply  the index configuration as below  we are keeping the default parameter so there are don't taken effect #index number_of_shards  5 #index number_of_shards  1 #index number_of_replicas  0 and could you please kindly tell us how to check the index status  thanks a lot b r lance
possibly  but it's not going to happen anytime very soon 
elasticsearch is installed from the supplied debian package on ubuntu bionic  annoyingly i didn't cut and paste the exception  and the stack has been dropped and the logs are gone  i now can't reproduce this with this config  this starts up 
 eskibars thanks a lot  i was looking for the same 
i like the idea of splitting  allthethings

in your cluster  assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and # replicas  the rule of thumb is  # # 1  having more _shards_ enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to # _distribute_ a big index across machines  # 2  having more _replicas_ enhances the _search_ performance and improves the # cluster _availability_  # # the "number_of_shards" is a one time setting for an index  # # the "number_of_replicas" can be increased or decreased anytime  #

 clintongormley sure  we're using rethinkdb changefeeds to keep our elasticsearch indices up to date  however  rethinkdb does not  currently  support changefeeds on joins  as a workaround  we're opening a changefeed on the would be joined table and using  _update_by_query  to keep the joined properties updated across all documents 
 areek ah that's what's happening  thanks for clarifying – _and fixing_ 
 dadoonet after install        bin elasticsearch plugin list       xpack  clintongormley yes in fact  i used to download the zip file into the plugins directory and tried to install it from this location   path to elasticsearch 5 1 1 plugins   i will update my initial post to indicate this fact 
we have 3 master eligible nodes  and value of discovery zen minimum_master_nodes is 2 
 bleskes we set minimum_master_nodes   2   we have 3 master eligible nodes   i cross checked nodes to see if they were pointing to current master  and they were  the cluster is not around anymore  if i can get some guidance on what additional info to collect  i can collect it and report back the next time this happens 
mmm it's weird  i created the folder in  backup_es and now i'm able to do it  thanks  
 s1monw  not using any special features i'm aware of   it was a vanilla install  both are running on different machines  i've seen the issue twice  once when testing what would happen  and the second one when i had just moved to work on a laptop for some time  then came back with it to the same network where the original desktop was  i had meant to first back up the database in case it happened again  to have a repro case  but forgot  i haven't tested since  will see about finding a time window   bleskes  on the logs for that day i see it on node2  i believe node1 was up before i brought node2 into the network  i may have restarted it after booting node1  as iirc i was running it from the terminal  
 dadoonet version 3 0 4  full details below 
 imotov here's our problem in more detail  we have a large cluster holding 9416 primary shards  each of these shards has one replica in a different az  we're deploying in aws   we've sunk a _lot_ of engineering effort into a pretty elaborate higher level allocation strategy that ensures the indices that are actively being written to have shards evenly distributed across 4 "indexing tiers" made up of 24 nodes in total  the problem is  short of actually disabling elasticsearch shard allocation and doing it 100  ourselves  we have no way to control where the primary shards are allocated  we're already using  index routing allocation total_shards_per_node  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current allocation total shards html  but this does not stop a large number of primary shards from clustering on a small set of indexing nodes  if the snapshot process randomly selected between the primary or one of the available replicas for the primary   the same way queries do today  then it would more evenly spread the snapshotting load across our active nodes  before you say it  yes  i know our use case is crazy  i have virtually every pm and dev at elastic telling me we're crazy  maybe we are  if we're cognizant of our possible craziness  wouldn't that mean we're definitely not crazy though  hmmm    anyway  you could simplify this way down  let's say you have 2 indices each with 3 primary shards + 3 replica shards  allocation looks like this   in this case  node a has 4 primary shards  node b only has 2  so  during a snapshot  nodea currently has to do 2x more work than node b 
that worked  thank you 
 steeve mmm good point but no  same result 
some users take es as the main storage system and keep like years data  which is structed as daily rolling data  in es as the archieve data  some old data are seldom used but they will be used one day  in order to reduce the cluster's memory presure  i'd like this feature 
thanks  davecturner  i've uploaded the above dump  will attach some more later  btw  nice upload service  a simple curl upload would also be good  
so my cluster consists of 3 dedicated master nodes and 30 data nodes  when doing rolling deployments i deploy to the master nodes first and then the data node  i only see that error when deploying to the master nodes  i didn't realize that master election is only supposed to take 3 seconds  perhaps it is taking longer than usual for some reason  btw i am using elastic search 1 7 1  also i am not specifying a timeout in the write requests to elastic search but my http client will wait 30 seconds before timing out  i'll look through the log files to see if i can figure out how long master election is taking 
is this what you're after 
this page includes the date math information  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference master date math index names html example from page  curl  xget 'localhost 9200  logstash  now d 2d   _search'   "query"             i try this curl command and get a error  curl  xget 'localhost 9200  logstash  now d   _search'  d '  "query"     "match"         '  "error"  "root_cause"   "type" "index_not_found_exception" "reason" "no such index" "resource type" "index_or_alias" "resource id" " logstash now" "index" " logstash now"   "type" "index_not_found_exception" "reason" "no such index" "resource type" "index_or_alias" "resource id" " logstash now" "index" " logstash now"  "status" 404  there is also this pull request  add date math support in index names #12209 https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 12209
yes i've verified this on 1 7 2
in our use case we use the main query as a blocking step to retrieve good candidates for a more computationally intensive rescore function  in a custom plugin   running the function over all the documents in the index isn't feasible  nor can we accomplish our blocking query as a pre filter  part of our application needs to retrieve all documents that score above a certain threshold after applying that rescore function  sometimes the number of documents above the threshold is large enough that i assume scrolling would be more efficient than paging  at least as i understand it  i admit i have not done any benchmarking to verify this assumption

#### create index with mappings  the score for the above query is 2 0 which i think is wrong

thank u    
 jpountz i totally agree  i ran a lot of benchmarks over the last few days  until today  and came to the conclusion that 32kb is indeed a good value  i just wanted to ensure that we don't have unwanted side effects  expect a pr within the next hour 
i made some tests about the behaviour of primary shard distribution based on the other users thoughts mentioned  i find that there is no cpu or ram overhead on the node full of primary shards when making query or inserting new documents  on the other side the only thing i found odd is when a new node added to the cluster  the only node sending the data to the newly created node is that node which is full of primary shards and this behaviour makes network and cpu overhead only on that machine 
yes  of course  i cleaned it up a little bit
you right  murmur 3 is not loaded   however i have done  bin plugin install mapper murmur3  to install it  and i just retried and it warn me that directory already exists   what do i miss

ok i reduced the amount of data in my example  as you can see  each aggregation of each drilldown has the same exact value of "300 1" this is incorrect  it should be bound to the breakdown of each bucket within each sub aggregation 
this first example is from a get query   this is really inconvenient  and prone to bugs  because i have to write almost identical two copies of that custom deserialization code   one to deal with searchhit and searchhitfield  and the other to deal with getresponse and getfield   and always remember to keep them in sync with each other  it would be far better if both of these es class structures implemented a common interface structure so i can write one common deserization method that does not care whether the document given to it came from a get request or search request  my deserialization code should not have to be tied to the type of request that generated the data  or even aware of it 
yes  that can be done and need to handled explicitly in the conf  so was just thinking if this could be made as info as this seems to be important metrics to keep an eye on cluster 
 s1monw sorry  i could not follow you  i tried the following  this created the new index in the original location  also i cannot find documentation of using path data per index
unfortunately  being an es federal user  i don't have any way of getting the heap dump or screenshots to you  i will continue working it on my end to see if i can narrow it down further 
hi  clintongormley you are right  logstash sends the template to elasticsearch and it works as expected  if i delete elasticsearch and restart a new one  logstash never sends the template again or makes sure that the template is in place although it had to do a reconnect  i can reproduce this like this    start logstash  it will print an error that it couldn't connect to elasticsearch but keeps running   start elasticsearch  logstash automatically connects to elasticsearch once it's there and inserts data  the template never gets written  it looks like the template only gets send   once   to elasticsearch and only if elasticsearch is reachable upon startup  i never observed that logstash would send or verify the template at any later stage  i am not sure if this is by design but i would expect logstash to make sure that the template is in place if it couldn't send it on startup and maybe also if the connection to elasticsearch dropped and it had to do a reconnect  i set template_overwrite to true but i guess this only has affect if the template on the logstash local disk changed but not on the elasticsearch side   
 dadoonet ok  we are using elasticsearch 2 1 0  so not try it on 2 2 
yep  thanks  so here is the request with the missing results    thanks for your time
 ywelsch i have tried deleting it before but that doesn't work either  only rebooting restarting the nodes tells me which one is stuck via the defunct java process  i cant find my thread dumps from before so i will have to wait a bit and i will try to get you some  elasticsearch continues doing everything else while this is happening  only seems like snapshot and restore are affected 
 nik9000  i will get that once it returns to a failed state again 
surely  randomization documents doesn't work
yeah i mean we have a symlink  but interestingly it can create read write the indicies but can't write tmp  i have tried without a symlink fails the same way have you checked the kernel dump i've attached to the original post 
it works after upgrade to 2 3 3  thanks  jasontedor 👍
 clintongormley  i am sorry for being ambigue    what i meant was that we have deleted some logs from  var log elasticsearch because they were growing at fast rate because of the recovery process  as  uplexpaul mentioned we do have the translog ckp but not the translog files itself  when you try to start elasticsearch with those indices it will complain that cannot start due to reasons that i have posted previously in my first post  any help it is appreciated  thanks
thank you  what do you mean my setup 
 jasontedor thanks for the clarification  i guess it falls under the community maintained docker library builds of elasticsearch from here https   github com docker library elasticsearch the documentation for  elasticsearch image  dictated that  index version created  needs to be set  which is indeed true as leaving it unset gives the same results as setting it to  2030399    kiwionly   the plugin maintainer  says the code that actually does the checking is in es itself and not in the plugin source  i've grep'd the source for  elasticsearch image  and i couldn't see any references to requiring   2000000  values for  index version created   so i figured i'd ask here 
it does remove the old library and installs the new one but attemps to load the old  removed one 
version 2 3 3 and 3 nodes
yes  i do have 3 nodes and i unmount only on the one i am executing the snapshot creation  the same is not true for restoring a snapshot 'i suppose'  i e even if one of the nodes has the share mounted  we can restore the snapshot on a different node where the share is unmounted 
2 3 4
yes  that's correct  i'm using my own docker image  which i have used without problems up until es 5 5 1  
i'm in discussion with the docker guys what the correct way is  i let you know asap 
working on it  just a minute 
hi  javanna  for instance  it might be useful when you use the bulk update api  this api call might take significantly longer that what you would expect for a "normal" search query  setting the global timeout higher is not a good solution imho  in hibernate search  https   github com hibernate hibernate search   we are working on the elasticsearch support for the next version   we also allow the user to set the timeout of a query  this is used to set the lucene timeout in the lucene backend and the elasticsearch timeout in the elasticsearch backend but  if we are using the rest client  we need to be sure the http timeout is higher than that  that being said  i think you're right about the number of method arguments and maybe a dsl would be in order  to be completely thorough  i tried to implement a backend for jest  https   github com searchbox io jest  based on the elasticsearch rest client the other day and i found that the jest client has a lot of useful options  the reaper for connections idle for too long being one but there are a few others which might be interesting   i think taking a look to what is done there might give you some good ideas  that being said  they do not support setting the timeout per query atm either

hi guys  sorry for the late response  after some digging the source of the issue was one of our scripts which wasn't parameterised  leading to the issue mentioned here  https   github com elastic elasticsearch issues 19396
hi  jasontedor  thanks for pointing out #20640  i think that the suggestion works    i'm just trying to piece it all together  the docs are a little confusing because  auto_create_index  can apparently be either a bool or a string  depending on context  to avoid confusion  i highly recommend using  a new name  for the new setting that goes  inside  the template  i e  avoid reusing  auto_create_index  again as it is a string now  or proposed  and in a different location  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current docs index_ html#index creation says q  in the example just above  the aaa  would be referring to    is that a regex to match an index name  it would help to be discussing a specific example  lets ask this  to accomplish the desired goal expressed in this ticket  what would be the steps  the precise protocol  to activate the "no new index without a template" step 1  step 2  step 3

hi  thank you for your help  here are the new elements    tlrx  today i waited a long time and after a lot of time the process of the remove of snapshot finished     7 minutes on the test cluster  1800 snapshot and a volumetry of the cluster estimated at 600 gbytes    on production  it doesn't finished after a timeout of 3 hours  aroud 50 snapshots for a volumetry of the cluster estimated to 6 tbytes   abeyad   i see no logs on any of our nodes on  we have log at info level   is there some request  http or transport api  that can give me the process of delete of the snapshot   i see nothing on pending_tasks nor snapshot api endpoints   or some log i could activate  
i should point out that there are indices which were created by that template  and they contain data  however  i was under the impression that the template should only influence   new   indices  not existing ones 
lets say we have a bunch of alerts    now i want to count the alerts bucket them on the day of week they arrive and would be pretty useful if i could order them based on the day of week  like    monday  tuesday  wednesday  etc  and similarly many people would like to have their own ordering logic so having option to add such features via plugins might help  this becomes more prominent when you want your kibana visualizations to show up in a specific order and leads to issues like this    https   github com elastic kibana issues 10543 which happened because of this    https   github com elastic elasticsearch commit b01e3f0d3b35f15032ec90f2838d51873b961566#diff dfda7f92593222e55a117eb83d3ea89er61 on top of it  elasticsearch being a search engine  it would be very helpful for search results to be ordered via custom logic as well because you certainly can't cater everyone  so why not give possibility to define custom ordering logic via a plugin 
there is nothing in the logs for this npe  i checked the logs everywhere and there are no logs at all
looks like proxy issue  closed
i cannot reproduce on 5 4 
i actually only used sense and just copied the curl equivalents here  my bad  i'll try again with sense and directly with curl too to verify 
no problem and https   github com elastic kibana issues 33218 is created 
 rjernst aaargh  you're right  the indentation was off  i've corrected it

hi  martijnvg   sorry  it was just a copy paste error  i had the right description for that step  but grabbed the wrong json block  i've updated my issue   does it make more sense now 
the folder
the original command is  wget  qo   https   artifacts elastic co gpg key elasticsearch   sudo apt key add   with ansible it should look like this 
 jasontedor same goes for get   400 bad request with empty response  executing both get and head via curl against the es instance did just fine  switchting to the basic apache http client with the same request url resulted in a 200 ok rather than 400  this was just getting more strange  as i could not reproduce this locally  i will try to get some logs out of the aws service by tomorrow  i cannot access the logs today 
 cbuescher thanks    it's working as expected  at first i didn't fully understand the flexibility of filters aggregation  the syntax is a little verbose  but as long as it works it's ok   
hi  sorry for the delay  the use case is a little bit articulated  i'll try to keep it plain simple  the company i work in is developing an analyzer which can manage  among other things  named entity extractions and structured text  by structured text i mean a text for which i provide explicit sections structure like   we often have tens of different named extractions  i hope this will clarify my request   
the failure message is 
it's my understanding we use the   non issue  label for issues prs that are small changes that should not be highlighted in release notes   weekly reports  e g  stuff like this  https   github com elastic elasticsearch labels  3enon issue   in the course of discussion   jasontedor recommended we use this label as a way to gate the changelog checker  as opposed to us creating a new label  the     at the beginning is a convention for typeahead convenience  i think

thanks for your quick response    sure  here you have the stack trace 
you're welcome  i started with the pr  but held back once i noticed that one of the "make sure you do x" checklist items included creating an issue first  please let me know if i missed anything or need to go about the change in a different way  i'm new to es  so i may have missed something obvious to long time users 
i can talk to the endpoint yes via other tools but elasticsearch seems to want to go to a non regional s3 endpoint    which is not what it is supposed to do i think  another thing i noticed that since bucket names can contain dots https validation of s3's wildcard certificate will fail    which is why i tried http as well    to no avail  i shall try to get cli to do an upload for me and will get back to you 
so we finally got the index working  elasticsearch 6 2 2  122k documents  6624 fields  some of them are text fields with extra keyword fields  so there are actually 13251 mappings   i will explain my use case  but since things work with 13251 mappings  it seems like elasticsearch shouldn't impose a hard limit  i can understand making the   default   limit 1024  but users should be able to increase that  i am using elasticsearch to do faceted search on health related datasets  you can see an  example here  https   test data explorer appspot com     nurse's health study  http   www nurseshealthstudy org   is one of our datasets  the nurse's health data is a table with 6k columns and 120k rows  each row is a participant  each column represents a field    eg weight in a certain year  menopausal status in a certain year  etc   of course not every participant will have every field filled out   in the index  each document corresponds to a participant  each of the 6k table columns is a field on the document  we want to use  multi_match  to search across the column contents of all 6k columns  for example   pre   finds  pre never    premenopause   etc  cc  bfcrampton
i can work on a pr for this one once i find a few spare hours 
they would like a deeper history of the shard movements then what is provided via monitoring currently  the idea is that they would like to run statistics on how es moves shards around and then judge how efficient es is handling this balancing  they would like to use this data to tweak hot warm see if they need to add more nodes  etc   
 s1monw yes  sounds great 
hi  dnhatn thanks for looking into that so quickly  do you still need the log file you asked  is there a way i can send it to your personally and not post it here  i also wanted to ask   7 5k shards for 6 data nodes is  1250 shards per node  it doesn't seem like a very high number  i have other clusters with the same setup which are working perfectly fine for months with roughly the same amount of shards per node  is it possible to increase the number of open files  could this help  or maybe is it a fd leak issue 
 polyfractal  thanks for your clear reply  indeed increasing the  shard_size  parameter from 20 to 200 gives me a more accurate result  i was not aware of this limitation  it is present but a bit hidden in the documentation  so it is not a bug after all  just for me unexpected behavior  i think it is more fair to future users if the limitations of elasticsearch are clearly communicated in any feature page like the readme of this repository  people need to make a decision which database to choose based on this kind of information  they do not  and in fact cannot read the entire documentation to make a well informed decision 
well that seems unlikely then 😉
 markharwood  jimczi did you reach any conclusions regarding the retry policy 
yeah it looks like the same issue  this has only happened to us once  we're not sure what the underlying cause was because the cluster had 100s of nodes in it and i think was in a reasonable state at the time
sorry forgot to mention that i'm using  querystringquery  and i have set  fields  to   "title"  "title exact"  "title folded"   so when not searching for a phrase all three fields will be queried
whoops  yeah that looks incomplete  1  create a text field with index_phrases   true 2  create a custom search analyzer with the synonym_graph filter 3  index something and do a query with the analyzer created above  i'm currently on holiday away from my workstation  but the above should result in the error 
 jimczi i admit i did somehow skipped going through the  transport layer  link when it was mentioned in the docs  do you mean something like adding another info point with the snippet  see attached picture   i think that would is a good idea  i would be happy to send a patch but it would quite helpful for me if you could tell me where these docs reside  elasticsearch docs code seems a bit overwhelming to me as a beginner 😅   thanks for your quick reply    remote_clusters___elasticsearch_reference__7_2____elastic  https   user images githubusercontent com 4801628 60506038 2ac23c00 9cef 11e9 9e9d 612c0f7a055a jpg 
the forums have a lot of the same questions like mine  but all be auto closed without a right answer   for example https   discuss elastic co t highlevel rest client retry requests on failure 163497 how can i solve my problem   
 polyfractal thank you very much for your answer  but i would like to politely disagree with you  you are right  in most cases the client has the interval  but there are also cases where the interval is decided by elasticsearch  eg  auto_data_histogram  and i also know there is a feature request to have something like auto_interval_histograms   in such cases  es gives back the evaluated interval  but it is not easy to perform simple  key+interval  calculations  because the returned interval is non numeric  e g   interval '1d'  being returned by auto_date_histogram  you are partially right  in most charting applications libraries  the key is shown at the center of a   bar chart   and not the   histogram chart    there is a slight difference between the two  but from kibana perspective they both are the same  because  elasticsearch does all the calculations   whereas  for something like plotly js these are two different things  https   plot ly javascript histograms  https   plot ly javascript bar charts  and if you observe the x axis in both cases  you will see that plotly js labes them differently  simply  because it is confusing  or looks unusual at the first glance   does not mean that  it should be represented incorrectly  even in my example  i am working with discrete values  and it took me sometime to realize that something was going wrong  especially  when applying filters   i did clarify that previously  but i can elaborate again  the value "6" is the start of the bucket  but it is show at the center of the bucket  where it should say "6 5"  or if you want to adpot from plotlyjs histogram  it should say 6 7  i see only two options  1  shifting "6" to the start of the bin  this is a less preferred option  as this would only solve the problem for kibana  but if someone is using someother charting library  these libraries always put the value at the center of bin  and they dont have a flag to shift the value to the start   2  return the average center 6 5 of the bin from elasticsearch  this is preferrable  as this will work out of the box with kibana and also with other client side frameworks  also  this will be visually more appealing  except for the people working with discrete values  i guess  haha   as it will be at the center of the bar  which is how most people are used to seeing both bar and histogram charts  thank you very much for your consideration and pacience in reading my long explaination  looking forward to your comments 
 davecturner org elasticsearch elasticsearchparseexception or org elasticsearch action actionrequestvalidationexception  to me as a user  if i am passing invalid input i would expect to see something validation or parse related and tell me the error made  internal java exceptions are the least informative type of error 
creating a simple rollup job on kibana ui below the json 
just installing and running elasticsearch  i saw the warning and wanted to report it  this is the first time i've ran es on this machine  typically i run it on macos which doesn't have any warnings or errors on first run 
the difference is the api key would be a privilege snapshot of the 'target' user  not a privilege snapshot of the user who is making the request to elasticsearch  the idea is an internal kibana system user   which has very limited privileges   it only has read write access to the system indices it needs to operate  could take create an api key of the end user logged into kibana  who will have privileges to data they want to run background jobs on  when they request a background job to be created and run  the api key should represent the 'target' user permissions  so yes there's risk that the 'requesting' user captures that key and now has expanded privileges  that's one way to look at what the internal kibana system user would be doing  but this action must be initiated by the target authenticated user  with the intent of creating a background task owned by that target user  in general we want users to have api keys  but not require users to be able to create their own api keys  cc  mikecote  tvernum
initalizing the client works seamlessly  it connects with the provided consul address to the cluster  connection established   and connection stays if no sniffer is used   then the node sniffer kicks in and does its round  parsing the response from the nodes endpoint  here it receives the publish_address in the es7 format hostname ip port  the json parser inside the node sniffer parses the value into a string and creates a new uri   here it fails  everything after the slash is considered as a path  the port is neglected and an uri with hostname and port 80   1  is created  the sniffer returns the new found nodes  updates the client  no connection anymore  i will provide the settings file of our cluster if necessary 
hi  davecturner   thanks a lot for your answer  and is there any command like  elasticsearch traslog trim  for translog merge  because before merging all the translog  my es node recovey very slowly even can't start  too many open files  
sure  will do thank you 
i'm using kibana for searching  and in the response result i see one extra " " which is breaking the process 
i've attached the output  if any params should be adjusted when running that endpoint  please let me know  thank you   hot_threads txt  https   github com elastic elasticsearch files 4243547 hot_threads txt

sorry  i forgot the      when trying the new version    with the new version it works  sorry    here's the verbose output but as far as i can see there's no difference   shouldn't that be escaped  for the case that signature contains percent signs   s and the like  
 kamilpyrkosz97 they have closed it  i did send an e mail to  dstftw but he hasn't got back to me as of yet  so don't think it will get fixed any time soonish   
my "theory"  as you refer to it  is a bug report  that was requested by an error message in the program's output  the title of the bug report is the "youtube dl  exe and python version s  do not work the same"  i go on to show an example where the same command  for the same video  when used on the two versions of the programs produces different results  it is no theory  it is a fact that is demonstrated  you say  "the  exe gets a proxy set  whereas the python version does not "  thus  you agree  there is a difference in the way the two programs work  it you did not need to know about this that is ok but i do not accuse you of being in a conspiracy  this is my first bug report here  i was doing as requested and trying to help  it is unfortunate that this was spam  i won't spam you again  sorry for your trouble to read this  bye 
 dstftw no  i can't  but http   www downforeveryoneorjustme com planetaplay com show it is up  and scivee tv and dump com unavailable too

that ffmpeg thread is 7 month old  i guess this ain't happening any soon  i guess you can close it 
its not the url i'm trying to download that is blocking me  it is my dns server that blocks me when there are too many dns requests happening when youtube dl is running and trying to guess a quality for the video its downloading

ah  sorry  should have done this in the first place    it's stock ubuntu 12 04 lts  here's the verbose output 
nope  that worked  _facepalm_ pardon me for failing to rtfm 
when you try to download with ipv6 sometimes it will not work because ipv6 got some issues about geolocalization  using an ipv4 it will not happen 
thanks for these explanations

thanks for the fast replies  i appreciate it  i feel stupid that i didn't try alternative players  the file _does_ play without repeating in a recent vlc  2 2 1  as well as an old 0 9 version  the problem occurred in smplayer 14 3 0  mplayer redxii svn r36621 4 8 2   i wonder if this writing to disk of potentially 1000's of tiny files in a minute or two will stress the hard drive or file system or make the drive fail sooner if one were to download these files every day 
to install it and use it i just need to run the above code  i saw a full tutorial of installing ffmpeg  do not need all these procedures  http   wiki razuna com display ecp ffmpeg+installation+on+centos+and+redhat

yes  does seem to be working now     thanks   
of course  sorry  url  youtube dl http   www youtube com watch v brbxwompwfs country  usa
oh yes it works fine this time  +1  thanks   
okay  thanks for your quick reply  the goal is that once the you have extracted the video information from youtube for example  in a json file  there is no need to roundtrip to youtube again just to download the video file  i would be a nice to have to instruct youtube dl to use a json file with the extracted video information 
i'm using win 8  it has had some errors the last couple of days  and yes  ydl list is only a batch file with links for tracks on youtube i tried changing font in cmd   making it able to use utf 8  but all that happened  was the ansi ascii error output was gone  and the submitted error output was all that was left  i'm not really sure what to do  but it sure was interesting error to get  date  tue  30 jul 2013 13 53 42  0700 from  notifications github com to  youtube dl noreply github com cc  viqmsl hotmail com subject  re   youtube dl  invalid url protocol  #1155  what is the content of ydl list bat  the file extension makes me somewhat suspicious   is it really a batch file  — reply to this email directly or view it on github

when i update youtube dl then it definitely works  may i know the reason why does it happen  same video is working before in old version and suddenly it stops working   youtube make some changes at there end so you also have to update youtube dl almost everyday  
happens with every f4m video i have ever downloaded  but in the spirit of the day  i will offer this link  http   www nbcsports com  horse racing american pharoah ends 37 year triple crown drought

no   verbose option cant fix my problem because my playlist have many video  200   300 video  i downloaded with youtube dl and i go to bed i dont know what video have error because output is too long thank you for your comment
unfortunatly  it does not work for me  youtube dl version 2013 11 25 1    youtube dl http   www tou tv et dieu crea laflaque s10e09  tou tv  et dieu crea laflaque s10e09  downloading webpage  tou tv  et dieu crea laflaque s10e09  downloading stream list  download  destination  et dieu créa    laflaque saison 10 _ Épisode 9 et dieu crea laflaque_s10e09 mp4  rtmpdump  0 bytes error  rtmpdump exited with code 1
perhaps something like      5mb total bandwidth usage  video  1 mb  20    page download  1 mb  20     json requests  1 mb  20    http request overhead 2 mb  40     download efficiency 20    1 mb of 5 mb   estimated bandwidth usage 200 mb for file size 40 mb  above are just dummy values  perhaps the user can have control of what is printed would be the best option  if the provides a cost per byte  kb  mb  gb  etc  you can print the estimated cost of downloading the file also the play list 
just thought this might be a bug since i get this on the same files in the play list 
c  downloads youtube dl  u updating to version 2014 02 22 1     waiting for file handle to be closed    
going through my logs  the last video i saw with 256k was this one on 7th december  not sure which version of youtube dl it would have been  but definitely pretty current  http   www youtube com watch v fzactybisma as pulpe says  it was the 141 itag 
solved   
yes i can load the video in my browser  it's weird you can't
i have tried the 2014 01 27 1 version and it works indeed  the issue can be closed  big thanks for the tallented people who fix services the other people made crippled 
sorry  been out of town for a while  it definitely works now  but that is probably of no help 
oh i didn't know that it was cropped  i clicked this link via some review site i didn't remember but it didn't work with youtube dl  i found it was a rare case that youtube dl can't handle  so i reported  thanks a bunch anyway  +1 
http   en wikipedia org wiki symbolic_link take this youtube account  https   www youtube com channel uccpethgyyi1lqbmarojegya now if i record it with just the channel id i won't really remember who it was  but the channel name can change over time it would be nice if it did something like ln  s channel_id channel

avconv version  ffmpeg version 0 10 12 7 0 10 12 1 saucy1 yes  it did work  what did you do  was there something wrong with the md5sum or video  i would like to know for future full hd tests  i also noticed the file size was remarkably 97 mb rather than 350mb 
i just searched for examples of  rtmpdump  used with livestream com  got the parameters off some forum post  heh  sorry  that's all i got 
ok  thanks a lot  i will consider this issue closed and open another one regarding trilulilu ro best regards  on thursday  october 30  2014 6 19 pm  naglis jonaitis notifications github com wrote   phihag  this issue was not fully resolved  the trilulilu ro part   maybe we should keep it open until then  or maybe open a new issue concerning only trilulilu ro  — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
wow yes you're right  after updating the output is perfectly descriptive  i was sure i updated yesterday but my memory must be failing me  sorry 
unfortunately i was a tad overzealous posting this bug report and actually found the other reports faq update instructions almost immediately after  my sincere apologies for the duplicate issue

yes i can  https   vine co v o6b6prltajk when i download it as i stated in the op  it uses the description of the video rather than what it would use in previous versions  if i still was using an older version  it would've downloaded it as "josh peck's post on vine 123128312831230 it usually sticks in random numbers after vine   mp4" but it downloads as "when haters hate  ya just gotta shake it off  kingbach  christian delgrosso  curtis lepore o6b6prltajk mp4" or is there perhaps a way to just download a viner's vines and skip over the revines  if not then back to what i was saying then  it was just much easier for me to delete the revines via linuxs terminal with the previous versions  thanks for replying btw

win+r  typed cmd and pressed enter  then i installed youtube dl via chocolatey  then ran the command to download a video  it ended up in syswow64 rebooting would fix that and i guess restarting the cmd would too  after closing and reopening cmd it works as expected on thu  dec 11  2014 at 1 16 pm  philipp hagemeister   notifications github com  wrote  ## best regards  rory
speaking of randomly cranky software    i'd gladly maintain a fork of mplayer that supports ssl  something like "mplayer ssl"   but at the moment i have no idea how to add the functionality    once it exists  the only task would be to patch each new official release  strange that the developers of mplayer haven't bothered to figure out something like this by now  ssl support is worthwhile functionality to add  even if it means a substantial refactoring of existing code 
same for several other videos  https   www youtube com watch v emc_2hzwzgq https   www youtube com watch v yys5oqzgp_o all are 1080x1920  vp9 video and aac audio  and therefore were merged as mkv  when youtube dl downloads the avc version and merged as mp4  it's ok 
try this one   https   www gloria tv video byq2rwexm9h
at line 39 of your  readme md file  https   github com rg3 youtube dl blob master readme md 
it seems it is working today  no broken problem   but still  only part of the whole video is downloaded  for the link above  the downloaded video  in flv format  is only 6 minutes long  though it should be approx 20 minutes  i put the dump files in a single gist at https   gist github com shichao an 03e49eaf02fec307ad1a
as indicated in the logs above  yes  i've tried using the    no check certificate  option  in vain 
yes  i am running the latest version  i did youtube dl  u yesterday to update the application  it failed on various videos already but here's an example of a video that didn't reliably download  https   www youtube com watch v i5bxvdmxsiy note that it might not be reproducible since the failures are quite random but big videos usually are more critical  maybe data downloads incorrectly by coincidence  thank you
i wasn't aware of that feature  and i've read readme md  great to know  many thanks 
tried multiple urls  you may use this as an example  http   vk com video 84761705_171277495
nope  i am using   download archive   it's in the default config file for me   some videos in the playlist i have are of no interest to me  i want to see what videos are in the playlist  and decide which to download  if a video is in the playlist and in the download archive list file  then it won't even be attempted  and i won't see a filename for it    so if i am counting filenames  i won't have the right playlist index   entirely separate  why am i not getting notices when a response to my posts here come in  
it seems like the main difference from https   trac ffmpeg org ticket 2221 and what's in embedthumbnail py is that embedthumbnail py doesn't have the option  id3v2_version 3 
i don't have a specific link at the moment but earlier on my windows machine  some videos wouldn't download at the highest available quality until i was told that i have to download ffmpeg  so on my mac machine  i downloaded ffmpeg in order not to have the previous issue however i ended up getting that warning in my first post  so i removed ffmpeg  on my mac  and now videos are downloaded in mp4 again  so yea  what should i do in order for me to download the best video quality as well as in mp4 format  i want to avoid mkv or any non mp4 formats while having the best video quality possible 
i've done that and uploaded to a file sharing service i found on google  here's the link http   s000 tinyupload com index php file_id 50497864888814330087
 apologies for the url     
 dstftw yes  i am a resident of the u s   the only main country likely to be supported by this section of the website  if any geo restrictions are in place   and a windows rig i have running on this ip _is capable of successfully streaming the videos_ in browser 
yes  when you go to the website the video does play
alex ayyy desktop    youtube dl http   www liveleak com view i 480_1430856831  liveleak  480_1430856831  downloading webpage error  unable to download video data  urlopen error  errno 8  _ssl c 510  eof occurred in violation of protocol alex ayyy desktop   
yes  i can both watch it and download it with the url provided by the "download helper" firefox addon      edit  it might be a server side problem  i have found a couple of downloadable urls on the site  e g  http   www rtve es alacarta videos grandes documentales grandes documentales maravilloso mundo crustaceos 3144299 
yeah  it works fine for me  it may be geo protected though  i compared the f4m manifest with a f4m manifest from a ripable video  and this element was the only major difference   the token protection probably prevents the current script from working on the video 
the physical url that points to the video file  www youtube com         somevideo mp4 for example 
sure thing  i'll do it tomorrow as soon as i get back to my laptop  when you say "youtube dl should download courses just fine" you mean that it should be collecting all the videos and not just one video when importing cookies right

it doesn't  most likely  any example urls  mpv doesn't continually get the json from youtube dl  it just does a single query  so it's not essential to produce fragments list at all with live content  things like streamlink livestreamer or  youtube dl  o     mpv    would be required to support livestreams  there hasn't been any demand for that on mpv's side  since there's still hls streams  which do work fine

 yan12125 i don't know the auto merging you've mentioned  but bilibili download feature did merge all clips together  probably version in last year  and i reported this when i found out  https   github com rg3 youtube dl issues 8314 like if i download best quality for youtube it'll merge audio and video into a single mkv file rather than audio track and video track alone  for bilibili it also should merge clips into a single file

no  but that didnt work before either  thats why i used this tool  additionally  i never used a vpn 
i looked at the tos but they only talk about user submissions and what user "aren't allowed" to submit  but nothing that strong enough to fit yt dls requirements i think  so if nobody else finds a sufficient notice   
i don't know  it was just an example url  they have the normal dmca site   email address  like most other services  nowvideo and a lot of other sites included in youtube dl   i think the following url doesn't violate copyrights  http   vidbull com me4gn6lxm01t html
like a charm  i didn't knew there was 10 18 version  if i ever have a problem again i'll try to force upgrade first  thank you 
no  i don't have flash player installed  and i don't intend to install it  by the way  youtube dl managed to get southpark de videos previously for me  it just recently got broken for some reason

i don't know for sure if this occurs for all long videos  but the bug did occur for the two that i have listed in my original post   which videos work and which dont — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
nope  i am calling it from my application  and reading both standart output and error streams to check whether there was an error processing the request or not  you can take a look at my repository   https   github com oguzhankahyaoglu youtubelistsyncronizer blob master v2 youtubelistsyncronizer youtubelistsyncronizer youtubedownloadexe cs 
previous experience of downloading the entire playlist tells me that the original quality of the audio files i'm extracting are always above 192k  i'm wanting to limit everything at 192k so as to preserve space on the phone that i'll be transferring these files to  i understand that there'll be some loss in quality  but 192k seems to provide the ideal balance between good quality and conservation of space  i may have misunderstood  but isn't the whole point of encoding to convert to other than what the original files on youtube are 
ah god  i just picked a random video  i'm in a sfw enviroment right now  but i updated the example video with something else  let me know if there's something wrong with it  
i've just checked and the video is still up and it is shown as being public
well  i use a vpn to unlock the geo restriction  and i indeed can watch the video in the browser 
the video id is the same though  when i click the link  https   mobile twitter com hananpak media grid idx 0 tid 701050373990174724  https   mobile twitter com hananpak media grid idx 0 tid 701050373990174724  the only thing opens is a video  what i wanted to request is that it can use this id and download the file correctly from twitter 
i see  my bad  thanks for pointing that out  i think it could be an useful feature  specially for those of us integrating youtube dl into larger applications  i'd be happy to take a stab if some direction was given  feel free to close or re tag  and again  thanks for clarifying this 
yes it works fine on a browser 
hi  i just don't know how to do this  basically  i have a shared linux web hosting which supports python  and basically  i want to be able to hot link youtube videos to players  for e g   http   yt mydomain com ytdownloadscript py link https   www youtube com watch v 1mek0s7tkmu res 720p   insert this url on a media player like xbmc  wmplayer  vlc   play it straight away  thanks 
could you elaborate  please  e g  command to run in terminal to check this   if you mean is there any errors regardless internet connection itself  everything is working okay except  youtube dl 
well  i have a lot of youtube subscription and i want to download video of all of my subscription channel  i want add one per one url to download
the video i wanted to download is no longer available  another video from this mediathek is  http   www1 wdr de mediathek video sendungen lokalzeit bergisches land video lokalzeit bergisches land vom  236 html but the verbose output with the current version of youtube dl gives another output   the behavior changed  but it is still not possible to download videos  thanks for your help
it worked when i copy your command  i noticed that my " is different than yours  but i am using english as my input source  thank you very much 
i'm using firefox  it could be because you aren't logged in  perhaps only someone with an hbogo subscription or hbo now subscription can test and set up each one 
it does  thank you

 yan12125 absolutely i knew that  in this case  it seems that my question is unclear  what i mean here is   i couldn't find what parameters should be used to search for youtube videos using youtube dl based on filtering by features  4k  hd  creative commons  etc   then the result of search queries are videos filtered by   features   only  for example  i search 10 videos of "christmas song"   filtered by creative commons license  so the result would be 10 videos with cc license only  i assume the parameter is like   _ytsearch10 "christmas song  creative commons"_  as i'm not a native english speaker  so i attached a screenshot  hope you'll get it    features yt  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16808184 21277198 ae1aa3ee c407 11e6 92e5 bf25ed11eee4 png 
thank you for fixing this so fast 
## my strategy  according to  accept_quality  i know the range of  quality   ## after i know the range of quality just loop  ## what's the difference in the resultant video  if you set type  mp4  you just get one quality  json  data so you just can download one quality video  in this condition result video's format is  mp4  
i have problem   i have not centos learning i should compile python files for youtube dl  i dont undrestand extractor folder should copy in  usr bin  what work   
on disk  the original  downloaded audio file is stored with correct unicode glyphs characters  on prompt and arguments passed to ffmpeg  the unicode characters are converted and shown as " " characters    i imagine the ffmpeg cant localize the file because this translation of characters  the output went to clipboard with correct unicode characters  but  as you see on the print screen  its printed with " " characters   image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 25252071 22159621 f83fdd2c df28 11e6 9271 8bda50cc6714 png 
today i had to download few videos from hotstar and found this in a forum  this has been around for over an year  but everyone suggested manually modifying the link and using ffmpeg to capture the stream  i tried modifying youtube dl and it worked  so i thought i would share it here 
thanks for the help  removing that from the path seems to solve the problem  strangely enough  i can then download episodes just fine  so what is actually the problem  if it solves removing that path from the path environment variable 
 tony il capo i couldn't find any way to download the individual files other than going to the weekend page sources  and then manually craft a tester page for a single race file as i did above  i was hoping there was a way to parse the weekend page and get at least a playlist that may individually be fed to youtube dl for individual download  but this issue was closed and i couldn't find any parser around as a semi automated workaround 
the subtitles are in this order  english  french  italian  german  i want german to be the 1st subtitle  how do i do that 
this is the extension http   en savefrom net  sorry for the ad     1  youtube dl has downloading opus  but just in some videos doesn't download it with the proper size  2  just to be sure  i try to download the opus of the same video with that extension  and i download it correctly  3  the video that i have problem with downloading the correct opus file is noted above  4  i tried to download the source as "best" not "opus" and youtube dl download  ogg  but still if this is the best audio  why the browser extension can extract opus

it takes forever to do and slows the download for me by extra 11 mins to the mux afterwards  where as direct from source ts parts to mp4  default  is instant with the   fixup "never" command  soon as the download is complete that is it on to the next download  no wasted time quick and easy  need mkv only for the fixing all the timestamp errors in the mp4  no tool other than mkvtoolnix so far has been able to fix the mp4  i have tried ffmpeg   mp4 to mkv and that doesn't fix the mp4 timestamps errors either  or maybe it doesn't use same default settings as mkv toolnix 32bit  is there reason why youtube dl cannot be coded for direct ts parts to mkv as a default option  mp4 default with mkv as the option   please do test mkv doesn't have the timestamp errors that the mp4 now have  mkvtoolnix as default does well to fix correctly ffmpeg doesn't 
no do i have to download it  and how i use it  
yes this video "https   www youtube com watch v euffmnu34rs" does seem to be region blocked  however even other videos that played normally in my browser without a vpn or proxy weren't able to be downloaded by youtube dl recently  but now youtube dl seems to be able to download them properly  by the way  when trying to download youtube videos that are region blocked to the us  if you're in another country can youtube dl download them  going to us youtube com doesn't work  because it says "server not found"  and someone else said that you can use   proxy  and put in a proxy address that can access the video  but what does that mean  how do you do that  where can you find a proxy address like that  youtube dl is an excellent program  and if i find any other videos that don't download properly  i'll let you know  thanks  have a good day 
 dstftw what do you think about this problem  can you explain to us 
sorry  i dont have username and password    my account is organization type
no  i live in us so that i can watch that video without vpn  no geolocking error
can youtube dl actually output that instead of  error  last message repeated 1 times  
yeah i spoke a bit too soon  recode does indeed re encode  it's nice to have capability in there but unless i can precisely control the encoding configuration then i rather to it separately  but it's getting complicated just maintaining an archive already a chore quite a bit more than i thought  what i meant to say is that the values are misleading then  it should be recode to x264 or hevc or stuff like that  encoding is a bit more involved to fit into one simple command so that could be a bit though out and redesigned but i don't have strong opinions there as i want to preserve the video quality first and foremost  even tho i know youtube uses the worst chroma subsampling  but it's about archive integrity 
very little but i'm open to it on tue  jun 4  2019  3 33 pm ealgase  notifications github com  wrote 
"contact the service and ask them to unblock your ip address" what service
i'm sorry  i don't understand what you mean  what counts as a "long option "
i'm using https   addons mozilla org en us firefox addon export cookies txt 
never mind  i think i found a solution anyway 
yes  i've seen this  but there is also somewhere a spec  that describes how to use profiles  i cannot find it any more     currently i found  https   www w3 org tr activitypub #retrieving objects and in deed  they wrote _the client must specify an accept header with the application ld+json  profile "https   www w3 org ns activitystreams"_ maybe it's a bug in their test suite    i'm not sure  if the profile spec tells us something about using quotes 
in spring data we support annotations and meta annotations that are annotated with jsr305 annotations to discover whether a package  class or method has opted in for non nullability  we do not express a limit on meta annotation nesting  so one can use either directly jsr305 annotations  spring framework annotations  that are annotated with jsr305  or further  composed annotations  that's  why we are using  annotatedelementutils     nonnull 's  when  attribute expresses non nullability or allows opting out to express that a particular argument or return value may be null 
i am trying to print any logging to show client aborting error  it should be done in  handleunresolvederror   however，i couldn't see any  sent from phone 
yes  i will provide an example project to restore problem scenario 
i only get 400 and i don't know what the server don't like  i only know that the same method worked for spring 2 0 0  my _multivaluemap string  string  credentials_ is only an example  in real it looks like this 
let's be clear here  _nested class_ is a class defined inside a class having no modifier in kotlin and static modifier in java _inner class_ is a class defined inside a class having inner modifier in kotlin and no modifier in java i am talking about inner classes in the issue  nested classes work as expected in kotlin  i cannot agree here  suppose we have java configuration  so i don't see why inner classes should not work if we talk about practical use here  this type of configuration could be useful when we are defining several components using one shared dependency and we don't want to inject it to each of them separately 
yes i used simple jndi now  but don't you think this feature would be useful and suitable in spring  it could be implemented based on the simple jndi nameparser 
 rstoyanchev thanks for reply  my controller is simple  it just takes string field as path variable and uses reactivemongorepository to find document from mongo db     getmapping "  connectid "  public mono responseentity usereligibility   getcustomerbyconnectid  pathvariable "connectid"  string connectid    try   return service getusereligibility connectid   map responseentity  ok  defaultifempty responseentity notfound   build       catch  someexception e    log info "error during retrieval of customer     "  e getmessage       return mono just responseentity status httpstatus internal_server_error  build         i did go through the #22332   but i need some more clarification  i see in #22332 issue reporter ultimately increased the mongo driver wait queue size to pass the tests  i tried to do the same by using  waitqueuemultiple 100  but i see that webflux implementation used more cpu and memory than tomcat container  i am using docker for windows to containerize and used  docker stats  to watch the usage  i tested both mvc and webflux with concurrent users of 10k with  waitqueuemultiple 100    i see the below resource usage   webflux   for a duration of  16 sec cpu utilization was more than 100  and highest being 197  memory spyke was from 534mb to 617 mb   83 mb   mvc    22 sec cpu utilization was more than 100  and highest being 179  memory spyke was from 643mb to 669 mb   26 mb if i increase the concurrent users to 15k  even with  waitqueuemultiple 100  reactive mongo driver will break with  com mongodb mongowaitqueuefullexception    so increasing queue size is not a solution for this issue  i see that tomcat runs fine even with 40k concurrent users  just that it uses more threads to fulfil the concurrent requests  how to fix this issue   is it like my application can only handle 10k concurrent users that too at the cost of more memory and cpu utilization   i might be missing very basic   please help me understand how to achieve 'do more with less' tagline of webflux 
 lgxbslgx thanks for considering this issue  i will give you a step and also some snippet of code i used  but you have to provide create a sample api that produces 403 response code 1  create a restful api that produces 403 http code  any response body of your choice   eg    "message" "403 forbidden sample"   and any request body of your choice eg   "test" "sample body"  2  request via post request via resttemplate   below is my sample function to create a post request via resttemplate
 snicoll you're correct that it's blocking  but jms sending and receiving both seem to map pretty well to a stream of events  much of spring integration is also blocking  but has provided support for converting to and from a flux since its domain matches the same event stream model  for example  given a jmstemplate it'd be nice to be able to do something like   both the "receiveasflux" and "assubcriber" methods would obviously have to defer to a blocking threadpool  and i'm sure there might be a better way to provide that functionality than adding methods to jmstemplate  but the core idea is to mimic spring integration by adding convenient functionality for listening to jms messages with a  flux message    and for pushing messages to a broker from a  flux message    while it might be blocking  we can still have a back pressuring stream that easily integrates with other reactive tools 
 bclozel here you go https   github com lazystone spring bugs tree 22973 it works on sb 2 0 9  but if you change sb version to 2 1 x here https   github com lazystone spring bugs blob 22973 build gradle kts#l6 then test will fail 
yes sure 
i have a subclass of   javax servlet http httpservletrequestwrapper     class httpservletrequestwrapper extends servletrequestwrapper implements httpservletrequest   ，see below    in fact wil caught a exception    java lang illegalstateexception  current request is not of type  com keynes newlife common request yjjhttprequest   org springframework mock web mockhttpservletrequest  ，_i found that servletrequestmethodargumentresolver have a high priority to handle it  and thus mine httprequesthandlermethodargumentresolver have no chance to executed  so throwed this exception from servletrequestmethodargumentresolver ，because servletrequestmethodargumentresolver and httprequesthandlermethodargumentresolver supports the same parameter type  _ in other words  when default argument resolvers and custom argument resolvers supports same parameter type   custom argument resolver always no chance to executed   thanks 
as far as i can tell it was to mirror the change in spring projects spring session#1308  the problem there was that they use a  onceperrequestfilter  to wrap the request object and set a request attribute  later code  when it saw the request attribute assumed the request was wrapped  but it wasn't  since an error dispatch needs to be done with the original request and response objects  in this way an error dispatch differs most significantly from a forward dispatch 
there is already code in the issue description to reproduce the problem

are you referring to  getbeansoftype     or something else  i mentioned the  getbeansoftype    map in the description 
thank you for the quick and thorough answer  i realize now i should have given more context 😄 i stumbled upon this once migrating from spring boot 2 1 x to 2 2 0  i am bound to a custom enterprise error model where basically each exception thrown is mapped to a json array in the http response  i had this test where  once zipping multiple exceptions like this    i was then catching them as a compositeexception in a controlleradvice like this  exceptions unwrapmultiple exception   then serializing to json  according to my input i would expect 2 elements in my json array but after migrating to spring boot 2 2 0 got 3 instead  in fact  what i meant by configurable is that   i do not want this 'extra'  even though stackless  exception    i tried to get rid of it but  onassemblyexception  isn't public so i couldn't leverage reflection to filter it out  had to rely upon hardcoded java classname instead   i also tried  spring reactor debug agent enabled false  and  spring reactor stacktrace mode enabled false without luck  i have set up a reproducer for my issue available  here  https   github com beltram spring debug backtrace reproducer   if you could pinpoint what i'm missing here or provide a cleaner way to get rid of this exception  it would be highly appreciated  thank you very much 
the use case is running some code that checks some stuff and throws an exception if requirements are not met before each   requestmapping  in certain   controller s  other options for implementing this are not as clean for example interceptors or filters   i'm calling this inconsistent behavior since in my example  checkc  and  checka  methods are called in the expected order but  checkb  is left out and i'm calling it a workaround since the  new object    in my example is just a dummy object unnecessary garbage  to make the methods get called in the expected order  two solutions come to mind  1  fully support  void  type for   modelattribute s  2  do not support  void  type for   modelattribute s and document this and throw a runtime error during startup  checkb  method was silently being ignored in my project for a long time  and perhaps create another annotation for such use cases 
 sbrannen here is a stripped down example of the controller   
 rstoyanchev upgrading to 2 1 10 did the trick  i think there was a bug in 2 1 6 version with direct memory leak  closing the bug 
yes  a custom  beannamegenerator  works perfectly  thank you  maybe this would be a good enhancement for the spring boot project  they could supply a property to choose a custom beannamegenerator    so i would save me the boilerplate code  10 lines  in my main class  for completness and to help others  this is my current solution 
to help you better understand this problem  i wrote a simple demo  spring framework version  5 1 0 
in general most urls looks like   the other complex case we have is where the  value  ends with        from memory when i last looked deep into the antmatcher stuff i think in both of those cases it makes a regex and does a regex match 
i can't remember why i needed the  clockprovider  i will try to remove it and see if i can remember the real reason why  when i was writing this code  i was also learning how to use gradle  junit5 features  figuring out the design of what i am building     etc so could be a good refactoring  below is my guess as to why i did it that way  i started out with beans defined via   bean  on   configuration  then i decided that i really don't like writing useless code  so i switched to   component  scanning with constructor injection  some of my src test classes contain samples using  springbootapplication applications that explore how a user would use a collection of classes outside of a test case scenario  so i wanted to see in the log warnings when i was using any kind of replacement test fixtures  in case my ci failed and i needed to investigate    postconstruct  seemed like a good way to do things 
yes  i had to redo my mmaps just about 3 or 4 days ago

that can be the thing yeah  something is wrong about it for sure  revision  https   github com trinitycore trinitycore commit 037ce92c172342fd54f4eb3808cdb8813d9bdce0
not really  to be honest i haven't paid any attention to it yet
oh yeah  copy paste mistake  btw  wouldn't it be possible to make gameobject_template reloadable   it would save my a bunch of time on gobs that require sai 
yes  195 doesnt have 25  this was working propertly before i update to master    
update  also happens in warsong gulch and when noone else resurrected  i was alone at the graveyard with the empty cancel window  sorry  have no idea how to reproduce it because it happens randomly every 10th battleground or so 
just try it and you will see we talk here about phase 3 infernal summon not phase 1 or 2 for some unkown reason in phase 3 fps goes down to 1 5 or so
 vincent michael not sure if there is a spell for it   aokromes thanks i'll do that   
it could be 10871 but i'm not sure because even if it is alliance human only  it should still be turnable in even for the horde because the turn in npc is the same as in the correct quest but at the moment the turn in npc does not have the question mark above his head 
i found it  didn't know this actually existed  how very handy  https   raw githubusercontent com trinitycore trinitycore 60e87db489b5bdb766e6e347a6dedd163adf30ec sql updates world 2014_03_30_06_world_broadcast_text sql
perhaps  if it was another zone then the map id could be different  but anyways in that phase you should not be able to see any creature in sunwell plateau except those

habits based on the template how to report problems and submit fixes in the tracker + it's a good policy to quote the author if i'm not submitting a fix i made

faction 14 ist the category for monster  this is attackable for each faction  i had tested it on my server     in the db it was the faction 35 and this is villian and not attackable  sry for my bad english    
yes i do  i would be hugely grateful if you could point me atleast where the problem could be 
i do not understand the question  can you please expand  x  
 kandera  i always test my patches but that's not to say i didn't miss something  it was part of my fix for furious howl not autocasting https   github com trinitycore trinitycore issues 3803 which is still waiting for review 
i didn't say anything about client process threads  i was talking about the db threads opened by the server for the auth   characters   world transactions  these are not released when the client closes which causes mysql to have to forcibly close them  if you set the db related threads in the conf to 1 this does not happen

core revision  trinity core 8375
added the comments 
added revision and database sorry   
before the database updates and the new core has still works wonderfully and yes i have the right riding skill   
mind control works on fe2a0fda4464effeb2fb655da84a0460328b1aeb at least on npc
337 615 rows found
when i was googling about this crash it was presented in cores like mangos  arcemu and tc2  so its not in core  it may be in db or something other    no core  mustnt be in db but its not in core
as i said  blackrock grunts  blackrock outrunners  blackrock shadowcasters  i haven't test them all  but i believe all blackrock ones have this issue  x
unfortunately i do not speak english  but try to explain the problem  sometimes  maybe there are exact cases but they are still unknown for me  after teleportation  eg after entering instances  battlegrounds  arenas or leaving them  character can not move  even turn around   but when you modify your movement speed  eg gm commands or getting on mount  etc   character can move again  also re login helps  so is there is a problem related to the movement of the players  when a player moves it constantly bounces  but it is not linked to poor internet or lagan server 
example  value rangedmodrange for range weapons it must be 100  but that value is 0  your range should be 5 34 yd range with gun  throw  bow  etc  but because the value is 0 so your range is vanish then you can't attack  sorry for my bad english  
 krepton its not crashed on last revision yet  before it was total of 2 times 
 terabyte101 hacks are what i was referring to when i mentioned not having decent anti cheat   shauren isn't there already a function canreachtarget or something similar that would maybe be able to prevent this or would you check on a z angle

 jackpoz  rushor wow i didn't know this was bugged in blizzard too o o  the supposed behavior maybe is that the server kick you for being afk instead of spam you a message that does nothing every 0 03 sec  with lot of people  it might cause performance problems   if you are afk but you can logout  the server automatically kicks you for being afk a long time  but if you can't logout  aka you are in a duel   it doesn't kick you  yeah  is blizzlike but maybe we want it fixed just in case 
when i call it in the water it swims behind sometimes but mostly it just stops  if i call it from the water remains just stand there on the edge  if i then go to the other side  it suddenly comes out afterwards  is there a fix for it  i see this comment  https   github com trinitycore trinitycore issues 9331#issuecomment 16829658 is this the fix  sorry for my bad english
only with gm on we can see sathrovarr the corruptor

i have sniffed this  it is not like there are a lot of waypoints  what i also notice is when it happens  the npc is not clickable and there is no name when she is flying around 
could this have something to do with unit_flag_immune_to_pc as  ovahlord said

on rev b1d0855624d1c83850fc36f5242437d7f7c1336b it does not even cast the spell  i didn't test it on current rev  if you have tested it and it works  you can close the issue 
nope  unfortunately not 
no  this quest works differently in legion and wotlk
wut     those vehicles are common vehicles with accessories  something like this   and when you spawn 55918  its orientation will be 0  same with those npcs i mentioned in description 
nothing just unit_npc_flag_gossip in this npc https   pastebin com nsj0d8z8
what blizzard does is some validation of the parameters  checking if the velocity value is correct and the fall time matches in relation to the timestamp difference between when you started the fall and when you landed   so to answer your question  no  if those checks are implemented properly you can't cheat  but my point is  fall damage should never rely on the actual distance that you have fallen  sometimes you end up taking wrong amounts of fall damage in some situations because of this  exiting a vehicle or dismounting from fly mount    i can't tell for sure why this happens only sometimes but changing the fall damage mechanic to work like i described here should fix it 
named an example already in step 1 how to reproduce 
 nawuko okay thank you  and i see it's not resolved yet either   dduarte sorry i'm not sure i 100  understand what you mean  could you try to elaborate  sorry again

first post edited and link was corrected
the problem is the npcs who have died in the cinematic  especially highlord bolvar fordragon  are still standing around the camp because they are not within the bounds of the phasing area  if you enter the phased area and look out  everything is correct  as soon as you leave the area  everything goes back to normal  including being able to see all of the npcs that should be dead  gm mode does let me see both phases at once  nothing seems to be missing from the post quest phase 
generated with sql errors  some quests can need more than 1 stack but in this state  the core add this default value if nothing found

i'm not sure about that   cataclysm and beyond changed too much about the way gossip works i think  a lot of them aren't even shown anymore on legion  i don't know if it was removed or just hidden  maybe someone that knows legion in and out can answer that 
i just do a side by side comparison with two clients of wow open  one running trinity server and the other live servers  as far as i know blizz has not done any changes to quest emote for npc's in outland or in northrend  there has been some new quests added since cataclysm  both out in the different world zones of outland and inside the instances  but those i of course just ignore    
i forgot to mention  if you do it that way it will work  you have to make a mob cast it on you for it not to work 
 treeston yes  a few random players have the problem  no matter what i do or try  those characters with the problem have nothing in common and it is worth to notice that it affects characters  not an entire account  i even moved one character of those players to my own account  where all my characters works perfectly  deleting cache y wtf everytime  that character does not work trying eses  esmx and enus clients  i have eses dbc locales  chatstrictlinkchecking severity   1 → the player a  who uses enus  client can not link professions to the chat because  ofcourse  i do not have the dbcs for that language  → the player b  who uses eses client  can not link professions  chatstrictlinkchecking severity   0 → the player a now can link professions to the chat  → the player b still can not

clean tc  pets do not level past level 75  i tried it with clean db  clear source  it doesnt matter which pet  leveling works fine up until 75  i am not sure how you were able to get past 75  because your pet's experience doesn't show going up
they do massive damage  jackpoz plus they hit super fast  so it takes under a second to wipe  the script summons the clones and they are not performing it's functions correctly  like  killyana said it should be spells 57500 57504
yes  i tried it in a team 
i know that this quest was worked on several times already  latest in #20853 what i hope for is that this is a general sai logic problem and not related this specific quest and that someone with more in depth knowledge than me  i tried to debug it a bit but didnt found the exact problem  looks like that you can create a situation where the death of a creature does not increase the script related counter correctly  and therefore it can happen to all scripts that use this script mechanic

it's not a failed build after all  the exception is thrown before nose is called in  ci script sh  while testing locales  started 2 months ago     with https   travis ci org pydata pandas jobs 12304585 via #5073  only on the locale_override builds   cpcloud  any ideas what's going on 
here's a comparison of memory use for a series of 8 char strings stored as  dtype 'o'   ragged strings   assuming int32 used for the level index value  since being in memory means we can't handle billions rows anyway  i used pympler to measure the memory footprint of python string types   for  n  rows with  n  distinct values and  s  being the mem size of a single value storing it as an  index   ndarray  takes   n s  storing it as a catagorical  labels and levels   factors and index values  takes   n sizeof int32   +  n s  again  we don't treat categorical data as categorical and for string data in particular the memory hit is huge since  s    sizeof int32  
i can't share the data  but i have over a half million rows with around 100k items that have anywhere between 3 and 30 rows each  i'm trying to get the series to a 3d panel so that i can call pdf values to get the corresponding values in 3d ndarray  grouped by item index   that example was just the fastest way i could trigger the memoryerror without posting the data 
i don't understand your question about rescaling the data first  as for the labels of pd cut  that would be a decent solution if duplicates were possible   i e  if i could do  and have anything falling into the first or last bin given the same category  but as it stands  that isn't possible and so doesn't change things 
see https   docs pipenv org en latest changelog   top item came from https   github com pypa pipenv blob 5402384425208d911aae56fc2c58a6dac03d2649 news 3178 bugfix rst
that fixes this case  although there are still a lot of test failures on my 32 bit machine  i'll close this  since there's issue #1125 open for those 
i agree that there are two changes   but they stem from common underlying concerns  i was also confused   i thought a general shift to allow disabling regex compilation was enabled in  pandas core strings   but for example   str_replace  still uses this logic   i agree that the behavior of read_csv is well documented and the error mesage is appropriate for  e g   read_csv   that said  the docs are a bit hard to navigate for newcomers    but that's a _totally_ separate issue   but the reasoning about efficiency and "least surprisingness" applies just as well here  i think  in particular  a single multi byte unicode character triggers the switch to regexps  which is inefficient  and confusing to a newbie   the auto regexp conversion logic seems parallel  and seems like a high level design decision that should be applied across the library  and as you can see from the above  the high level discussion ends up being more far reaching than i thought  there are several functions like str_replace that still only have auto regexp   in particular  i absolutely do not want to change  str_contains  to stick with string matching by default  while other  core string  functions continue to auto convert patterns to regexps  consistency is more valuable than one function being more efficient   less surprising  but let me know if i should split the issue  as i said  these aren't hard changes  and i'm happy to do pull request s

i'm not sure which issues we were after that have been fixed in master  but i do know that if you could provide x32 bit windows builds  we will use them  i'm using the suggested for x64 but there seems to be a lot of contradictory info around windows builds  i'll try with sdk v7 as that worked on x64 but have not seen that referred to for x32 
sure  i have various monkey patches on the groupby  i use a downsample monkey patched function that replicates the behavior for resample i'm requesting  so something like this works   i also may want to send the groupby to multiple functions  while resampling is fast  it makes more sense to do the grouping once and pass it around 
i need to join data frame 1 with data frame 2 and sometimes data frame 1 has 1 row and sometime more than 1  when it has more than 1 the join operation leads to nans and therefore a type conversion of the int columns of data frame 2 when joining them  after they have been joined i need to store them in hdf files during an parallel processing for later joining them into a big hdf store  but for that the types need to be consistent  so i need to avoid the automatic conversion to float for the case data frame 1 has more than 1 row  which i prefer to the solution of concert the whole data frame 2 to floats even so it's storing integers conceptually   sent from my iphone
i tried to set up a dummy example  but it does not fail    
the use case is the following  we are using the boost date_time library in our c++ application  timeseries created in our c++ application can be queried using python and we are looking into using pandas for the timeseries objects returned inside python instead of some bespoke python timeseries classes we are currently using  in the boost date_time library  1400 jan 01 00 00 00 is the minimum timestamp and 9999 dec 31 23 59 59 999999 is the maximum timestamp  as such our timeseries can have any timestamps in between in principle  although our main use case of crazy  where crazy means very far away from our current times  timestamps is due to constant timeseries which have a single timestamp  1400 jan 01   in most cases with crazy indices  timeseries have a single timestamp on 1400 jan 01 and then a big gap until more reasonable indices come along  out of interest  is the limitation in datetimeindex documented somewhere  in particular what are the minimum and maximum timestamp i can use with datetimeindex 
pandas  0 7 3  let me try it with master 
well  sort of  i tried to reproduce and discovered another strange behavior  here is the code for the strange behavior   i realize it's convoluted but i hope it helps  the original program is more complex and so far i haven't been able to simply reproduce the behavior i observe  but i did find another puzzling behavior     
pandas 0 10 0 python 2 7 3 windows 7
i understand  well  in most cases the reindex operation results in the object that uses the index object passed to it  i e  the index of the returned object is identical to the passed index object  but in this case it is not  i thought that pandas would work more efficiently if idexes are identical  not just equal  trying to optimize cpu cycles here 
while not larger project  i noted this used with https   requires io github xmlrunner unittest xml reporting requirements  branch master letting us know which dependencies are to be bumped  keeping up with latest patches from those projects  
looks like i was inaccurate about the error message thrown  the above throws an indexerror  version 0 10 0 
you are correct   sorry i missed that  one more question  though  what threw me was the fact that it works with the option  delimiter '   '  but fails with  delimiter ' '  i still don't understand that  since i thought the two should be the same  but anyway  you can go ahead and close the issue  thanks for the quick feedback 
awesome thanks for the quick response  and  i lust learned something new  pd options display width   200 solves my real issue with the wide data frame column wrapping  for anyone using wide screen monitors   smile  thanks for the great customization 
no  i don't think it does  maybe i am misunderstanding something  the tests i see in this commit don't expose the ordering issue  the default ordering of dicts seem to be more or less alphabetical or numerical  depending on the indices  in the code above i am reversing the indices from their natural order  and i would expect the dataframe to have the same row ordering as the  keys   list  however  the dataframe has the normal ordering of the strings  i'm using the "columns" orientation for the input data  anyway  maybe i shouldn't expect the indices to be in their original order  then  this is an interactive session to show the issue 
oh thanks  tomaugspurger   i'm on python 3 5 in os x 64  el capitan  
ok  great  good question  the bad news  figuring out what works and and what doesn't is tedious and time consuming  often  for example  i needed to convince people that pandas is suitable backend for production code  simply because things just did not work the way expected across platforms   versions  the good news is  mastering the task i outlined is quite doable  as far as i can tell from my use cases  before we write polished docs just a few blockers   solutions   the most pertinent points 1  parsing lines without unique index    see #385    use list comprehension + enumerate like   took me quite some time to figure what's wrong  in one application this even lead me to dropping support for older pandas versions  but this is not good  in science update cycles are slower     1  in place operations  if you want to be on the safe side  never try to use in place arguments but overwrite identifiers  e g  sort  reset_index  etc  2  iloc  ix  loc  etc      if you can make it with ix it's good  too often i found myself accessing the underlying arrays + casting  doing nan masking manually      3  jumping between pandas versions for testing     i know this may sound slightly accusing  but my goal is to help people using pandas for production code + convince others this is a good idea  which i think is the case  
pandas version    10 platform   linux get_info is a huge huge dataframe that is indexed by a timeseries  i think we should be fine without  fyi if i use match_price   get_info get_info index 0   i get the same problem and error

when i used  pip install pandas   it tried to install numpy as well since it's a dependency  however  that build seemed to fail  when i subsequently issued  pip install numpy   numpy did install correctly  i unfortunately lost the pip log  though i can probably reproduce it if needed  this fixed the problem  thanks a bunch 
so let's discuss this over at #3479 
it's similar  df groupby     apply     applies the function to the underlying dataframe in each group  so the function should take a dataframe  this pipe implementation would act on the groupby itself  so you pass it functions whose argument is a dataframegroupby  so  with this  you could do

to build pandas  i used the command "pip install pandas"  to install the virtualenv  it was so long ago i cannot remember  i just followed the simple instructions they provide  to create the virtualenv i run the command "source  users rmschne  virtualenv rmspython bin activate"  is there a "right" way for pandas to work  i did not notice anything special in docs  update  i looked in my records  and i used http   docs python guide org en latest starting install osx html for how to install virtualenv  pip  etc 
how would you use replace for the parenthesis  bear in mind that the value then needs to be negated 
under the hood  that is essentially what would be happening  imho  the proposed  alter  method would just be less typing and more readable 
ts1 1 1  ts1 1  1 that is  substract 1 from the timestamp ts1 to obtain 30 09 1999 and then subtract 1 again to obtain 30 06 1999 however  the frequency information is lost along the way and this generates an error 
here is an example of the table feature of matplotlib  if this is thats what you mean  http   matplotlib org examples pylab_examples table_demo html so i am using ipython notebook  which automatically displays dataframes  which is great  but it would be nice to incorporate the table into a plot  here is an example   screenshot from 2013 09 11 10 07 35  https   f cloud github com assets 1228240 1123240 b22dfed6 1aeb 11e3 82d3 653247a52fd1 png 
my previous comment  about my bug  was confusing  the bug occurred when there was a non empty index intersection  and i therefore expected to step into an  if  block  since  bool  returned  false   my code did not step in 
if i weren't overcommitted at work  i would  sorry     i'm creating a workaround for my specific case  not sure how to generalize 
this gives the problem to me    example2  https   f cloud github com assets 2300692 1522696 b8739ca6 4bab 11e3 8eae 82ee8da3412e png  it seems that the x coordinate increment is different in subplot 1 1 and subplot 2 1  the offset  x_11   x_21  ranges from  0   at the center of the quadrants  to almost  1   in this case  at the boundary  the x values are hand taken from the status bar 
i stumbled upon it because i do a merge and then create a new column which is a copy of the index  for further manipulation   sometimes that merge leaves me with an empty dataframe  more generally  i might want to create an auto numbered column with  df 'foo'    range len df     with the recent code change  i either have to change that to  df 'foo'    pd series range len df     or do a check to ensure that df is not empty 
this is from 0 14 0  but i have experienced the same on master yesterday  update  tested again on current master  still the same 
sure that works  but the creation of the unnecessary intermediate variable  df  interrupts the functional flow that is so nice to have in pandas  is there something i don't see against this addition 
this will trigger the segfault as well  numpy 1 7 1   1 7 2  pandas 0 13 0    note that the  print df  is required to generate the segfault 
i'd like to help  but i'm just getting started with cython  if i get better  i will chip in 
my search turned up issues #3041  #3043  #3552  and #3555  whoa  github's auto complete on those issue numbers seems totally unrelated    
after some playing around  one hypothesis is that the bug has something to do with int32 vs int64 dtypes  so initially  i exported it to csv and tried it on another computer and i got the right answer  i then saved it as an hdf5 file and i got the wrong answer  looking at the dtypes 
 sinhrks  yes of course  apologies   how about this    jreback   apologies i should have used   loc   should i treat   ix  as deprecated  and avoid use  i guess we could have three different indexers  depending on how you want missing values to be handled    xx_union  'bar' 'ba'        xx_intersect  'bar'  'ba'       reindex  'bar'  'ba'    or a parameter that specifies how to handle it  eg    xx missing 'error intersect union'   'bar'  'ba'      perhaps   reindex  could accept an error intersect union  aren't   reindex  and   loc  fundamentally the same thing  or am i missing a key distinction  one distinction would be that   loc  accepts boolean series  but instead the indexing values case 
 tomaugspurger   yes   that's the trick 
when the table is in the  test  schema   when creating a table in sql server if a schema is not specifically designated  the table will be created in the user's default schema  perhaps this issue could be fixed if pandas specified a schema for sqlalchemy to use that the user could potentially override 
i posted an answer on what works for me in the first question  installing from source   but for some reason  i cannot get to install it using pip 
ideally  i would have either wanted the cast to work as python unicode   function  that is   returned object are always of the "unicode" type    unicode objects are left unchanged    numbers are stringified into unicode strings    str object are decoded using the default encoding and a unicode object is returned  does that make sense in pandas

why does the method repr include the dataframe repr 
mhh because i need to compare all the dates one by one sent from my iphone
don't have a strong preference on how it behaves  or if we keep  as_index    just want to get rid of inconsistent behavior 
 tomaugspurger thanks for the comment  i admit having edtered it a bit in a rush     the resulting values of a aggregate function would be find  i do not know if i can create excel formulas from within pandas  this basic functionality was in a predecessor library  http   pytseries sourceforge net lib report html#example 3 html report i will have to check the record if this was discarded by when the timeseries part of pandas was created and functionality was matched against existing pytseries  so yes  adding a footer header as a formula would be great  https   xlsxwriter readthedocs io working_with_formulas html
sorry the silly question but where i do issue this command pd show_versions   
 kawochen have a look at  is_list_like    it does almost exactly that  https   github com pydata pandas blob master pandas core common py#l2329  the headline of my suggestion is that we consolidate   encapsulate the list checking there  rather than do it differently in different places definitely agree putting iterables   list like objects in an index is not a good idea 
yes  i'll do that  but it might take some time 
sure  in sql server management studio  if you double click on the table and expand "constraints"  you'll notice the duplication of constraints  if you right click on the table and do script table as    create to    new query editor you'll get the following code  which also shows the duplication of constraints

i wanted to keep track of the cumulative sum over last 30 days  exactly what a rolling window is for  the results came back scaled now and i didn't understand why  then i looked into the actual code and saw the  mean true   if my first thought was to get a  mean  wouldn't i use a  rolling_mean     i would think explicitly modifying the results by forcing a  true  would make more sense  here's a line from my project   window_30   pd rolling_window data_frame  window 30  win_type 'boxcar'  mean false  
 kawochen using ' ' as delimiter solved the problem  i got the following output    jorisvandenbossche i understood the mistake in trying to use ' ' as the delimiter since one of the fields was already having ' ' in the data field  hence creating the difficulty with csv quote_none  thanks guys 
they're id values bucketed by year  but with enough head room to allow millions of users in the future  so they're not datetimes and they're stored in a server as floats 
in the above i would think of _t_ as present and 0  or _n_ in my suggestion  as the start  here is an example  what i was wondering was if it is possible to add a window such that there is _n_ exponentially decaying weights and the rest are 0  so for the above data  with _n 3_ for example  for the last element of the series we would have   eq3  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 2401026 10419896 5bfc3e8c 7053 11e5 81e4 572b544f5fbe png 
can do   tomaugspurger  just to confirm  when you say link to those docs is the general practice to put that in a  see also  section  or actually add a hyperlink  i e 
 tomaugspurger i'm trying to finalize some things  i want to get  isoparse  in there and possibly a few improvements to the time zones  i am hoping a new feature release before the end of the year  i usually finalize a release on master and let it sit for a week or so  i can ping you when that happens so you'll have some notice

hi  in both cases i have latest numpy  1 10 1   i don't know if it's related or not but i actually got to this issue because i have a series where values are frozensets  in that case not only fails but there is also an exception  maybe the traceback helps you to know if this is numpy  or just pandas related
don't understand your question edit  i amended my example adding   dtypes   maybe it is clearer for you now
 jreback so i have something that works fine with python 3  but python 2 presents a problem because in python 2  round class  doesn't call class   round       in other words  you can't easily override the built in round   behavior in python 2  i'm not sure of the best way to handle this  i could just avoid the round   test in the testing code when doing a python 2 test and we don't worry about supporting round dataframe  with python 2  other suggestions welcome 
 tomaugspurger i did that  i get the  settingwithcopywarning   error   jreback here's a copy pastable example   the error seems to be when including  inplace true   the opration works fine when doing  df1   df1 drop 'orig'  axis 1  
 jorisvandenbossche in my computer this code example will cause an error： import pandas as pd import numpy as np from rpy2 robjects import pandas2ri from rpy2 robjects import r a r 'iris'  b pandas2ri ri2py a  pandas2ri py2ri b 
 tomaugspurger thanks for the interest  snippet can now be run as is and will trigger the same error 
i set  locale setlocale locale lc_numeric  ''   and want floats to use local decimal point symbol  this can be achieved with  "  n " format value    but pandas uses   formatting for strings  inside  to_native_types  function  which doesn't support   n  format  as of python 3 4 x64 win 7  this works   df to_csv buf  sep ' t'  header header  index false  float_format " g"   these don't   df to_csv buf  sep ' t'  header header  index false  float_format " n"    python   formatting doesn't know   n  format   df to_csv buf  sep ' t'  header header  index false  float_format "  n "    pandas uses   formatting  p s  maybe this refers to python issues and this issue should be closed 
the docstring leaves it unspecified  or at least it's not very clear  so combined with a python interpreter  i assume it always returns the left side's index  further  i interpreted  how  as inner  left outer  right outer  outer join  knowing which index will be returned in each case is very useful for scripts at least  now  back to this case  i have an algorithm whose inputs sometimes contains an empty dataframe  this will cause a lot of  nan s in outer joins and that's fine for my case  i don't have to check for it being empty anywhere  it just keeps working  except in the case i mentioned above  it breaks like so 
my versions  pandas   version     0 16 2 numpy   version     1 9 2 python 2 7 10 the code is just   chunk to_hdf 'all_data h5'  'df' mode 'a' format 'table' append true   chunk is dataframe  it appends a couple of times until crashing
yes  it does indeed look like a duplicate  and yes if this is the intended behaviour  what a weird choice though     then the docs need to be fixed  which i might pr  but nobody should hold their breath over that   thanks for quick response 
yeah  just trying to adhere to the contributing guidelines  sorry if it's unclear  basically i'd like verify_schema  code  https   github com pydata pandas blob master pandas io gbq py#l476  to change  currently it takes the schema of a bigquery table  which will usually have name  type  mode  and possibly a description  the _generate_bq_schema  code  https   github com pydata pandas blob master pandas io gbq py#l735  takes a pandas dataframe and creates a bigquery like schema that only has name and type  not mode or description   i think that verify_schema should only compare the bigquery table's schema fields name and type to the dataframe's "schema"  i just submitted my pull request  here  https   github com pydata pandas pull 13087  although i haven't completed all the checkboxes  that might explain it better 
it could be done using arrays or lists for  start  and  end  in the  businesshour  and  custombusinesshour  constructors  for example  mexico_hour   businesshour start  '07 00'  '16 00'   end  '14 00'  '18 00'   or it could be done using a single 2d set of start and end times  mexico_hour   businesshour open   '07 00'  '14 00'    '16 00'  '18 00'    personally i'd be happy with either  once constructed  usage should be exactly the same  for example if i add one  mexico_hour  to  2017 02 23 13 30  i would expect to get  2017 02 23 16 30   and if i add seven hours i would expect to get  2017 02 24 11 30  
it's different to  downcast   which concerns narrowing   maybe  inplace_strings  or  direct_strings   support for  downcast  in  to_records    would be handy too  but that's a separate issue 
can confirm it works in 0 24 2  thanks  tomaugspurger  closing
confirmed that the above example now works on 0 20 2  conda distribution   however  i now get a different error if i try to update an existing record  even with identical contents   i suspect this is an entirely different kind of error  so it might make sense to close this one out and start a new issue  but i'll leave that call to you

well this is just a reduced minimal example  i am analysing some web log files  with each line having a userid as one of the columns  for each user  i want to extract set of sessions  i e  from event login to event logout  so i group by userid  and then apply to each group the method that finds starts and end times  and returns a dataframe of them  the method works fine unless there is a user without any complete session  i e  the apply method returns a column with none's only  actually this example is even more compact   it seems to me quite a natural way   group by  apply to each group  get a dataframe back for each group that gets combined into one big list of sessions  
i will work on getting a compact  standalone example  but you can see an example of the errors and inputs here  http   stackoverflow com questions 41729212 new error during set labels in pandas 0 19 2 valueerror unequal label lengths 41729634#41729634
the types are very closely related and they have the same output  count  unique  top and freq   perhaps the bigger issue is with the wording of the docstrings  it literally uses the word 'categorical'  maybe there could be an addition of a new word for 'category like' data which would include object  category  bool and datetime 
thanks for the quick fix guys
  the syntax is much cleaner if you want a mix of columns and row multiindex levels   with the added bonus it is 20  faster than selecting columns before calling itertuples
 gfyoung i've been seeing this warning for a long time  the earliest version i've used is  0 20   i think 
yes  i have scipy version 0 18 1 installed on both environments  python 3 6 and python 2 7 
tested with master  it is still failing with the same error message  pandas  0 21 0 dev+8 gd50f981d7
i'm building it now    but    python setup py develop  is super slow  runs only one process   
here you go 
in #4988   jreback requested "needs to be in a separate pr from the deprecation change " my original pr for #4988 was to change the keyword  from  parse_cols  to  usecols   to match other  read_   functions and implement this functionality  this issue was created to separate the kwarg change from the functionality change 
personally  i found myself rewriting this function over and over again  putting it in the cookbook won't solve this problem  i can understand why this is not a good fit to the core of pandas  but i'm wondering whether one can find a better fit  for example a  pandas utils  library 
fixed it thanks   rik
no  this code is a part of a big project   but i can try to reproduce   
thanks for the link  i will post something shortly 
confirm that the above snippet does not raise with  0 20 2  fyi  i think that  0 19 2  comes down with anaconda  4 3 1 
for example  i want to have background gradient colors for 2 columns ctrl and test in a dataframe  but the background gradient colors are decided according to the difference of the 2 columns  i achieved it as below     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 824507 45603288 7015c580 ba5d 11e8 8160 38af1c8ed142 png 
 gfyoung i should have explained a bit more but glossed over the details since the suggested enhancement is basically just syntactic sugar  gb apply lambda x  x seriesproperty  looks ugly to me  i'd rather have gb gbmethod   in the example  category a  cat_a  is monotonically increasing  so not monotonically decreasing  and category b is in fact categorically decreasing  so you get false  true  this behavior is correct 
 jorisvandenbossche thanks my problem is solved it's my fault the schema 'stg ' is not necessary the true code   pdsql to_sql pg_df 'temp_20170731' if_exists 'replace' index false chunksize 10  
yes  the  ddof  parameter in  dataframe std    is similar  setting it to 0 would indeed be equivalent to  bias true   actually  i just realized that  numpy cov    also has a  ddof  parameter  and it definitely seems to be a more flexible parameter  i've changed the issue name to reflect this 
 gfyoung i added the plots the day i created this issue  any follow up since then 
 gfyoung   here is the output as the code stands  you'll notice that the output of the variable 'transformed all at once'  near the bottom of the printout  is missing the groupby key  which is 'typeid'  however  when the iteration by groups is looping  the returned dataframe from transform includes 'typeid'  the output i expect from the 'transformed all at once' section should also include the 'typeid' column which was the groupby key  is this not the correct expectation  thanks 
hi  i can confirm that 0 20 2 fixes our problem  because it does not see  next  method in 0 20 1   but in general it is not the first time we got surprising breaks due to some changes like this  do you know why we start changing this logic since 0 20  isn't duck typing rule sufficient here 
first step is to report the bug  logistically it seemed smarter to prompt discussion about the issue rather than just attempt a unilateral fix  1  should the behavior change  or should the attributeerror be documented  1  if the behavior should change  does the community prefer  none  or      as a return value for stata files that don't support value labels    my vote is      i'll happily submit a pr for either of the proposed behavior changes  but as a pandas pr is more than simply a diff to a single  py file i wanted to determine which fix  if any  before putting the pr together 
 tomaugspurger  thanks for getting back to me  i attached plots that show what i'm getting currently and what i expect  i'm not worried about bar width  just the color of the bars  to create the "expected bar plot png"  i bypassed pandas and went to matplotlib directly  here is the code   current bar plot   current bar plot  https   user images githubusercontent com 8380207 32189510 4c9546f0 bd81 11e7 90b6 f449dee58bed png  expected bar plot   expected bar plot  https   user images githubusercontent com 8380207 32189747 146f6c5a bd82 11e7 8ec2 eebe43a56727 png 
well i'm unable to import pandas after setting the mpl backend as you can see  so i'm reporting the output of show_versions without setting a backend first  i'm not sure whether this matter or not   the installation was a standard pip one   pip install   user pandas 
i am new to profiling in python but i guess the  unecessary  time is spent in 
sorry for troubling you   when using sqllite3  it's no problem  and then cause “overflowerror  long too big to convert”
no  i just wanted to raise the attention in case this is not on purpose 
sure  i will give writing a pr a try 
this is a sample scenario which comes common in scd  slowly changing dimension   there are work around for it  but it would be better if there was some temporary variable    scenario    1  select a list of columns from source data frame natural_keys    col1  col2       2  apply md5 function after merging all columns as string and add to   temp   column the source dataframe  source_df cdc  3  select same set of columns from target data frame 4  apply md5 function after merging all columns as string and add to   temp   column the target dataframe  target_df cdc  5  compare the cdc column between source and target data frame and set a   temp   column to specify flag like values matching   'nc'  no change   value not matching   'u'  update  value matching   'na'  ignore  target cdc is null   'i'  insert  in above scenario step 2  4 and 5 needs to have a temp variable and no point in saving its value in hard disk  i hope it clears everything 
sure 
yes you're right  thanks  no need for me to use  drop  at all 
sorry for so late replying you can have a try with operating cassandra database any select  my code have no any special setting thank you 
sorry i didn't provide more context  i think it is inconsistent because of the following example creating an instance of the _lib tslib nattype class directly does not register as null for pd isnull  
i don't know what is the best solution that can satisfy everyone  according to the  json specification  http   www ecma international org publications files ecma st ecma 404 pdf   including value other than string as object's key is impossible  in order to avoid this problem in my work  i usually eliminate all tuples and manage to get string expression in some way  before writing json   however  such kind of solution strongly depends on the purpose  if this problem won't be fixed  at least it is recommended to write into the api document that  to_json    is useless for  dataframe  with tuple columns 
the user given dictionary updates current key value file metadata  if user gives pandas key then it overwrites pandas_metadata but warning warn is issued  purpose  user metadata is very needed when  1  processing is done in several stages and you want to keep information about version algorithm used on each stage so you can debug it later 2  processing is done with different parameters and you want to keep parameters used with the file 3  you need to add extra custom information e g  sometimes one column comes from one source and sometimes it is calculated from other columns and you want to keep this information and pass to later stages of processing 4  you have certain very high level aggregates that are costly to compute and you do not want to create columns for them for me it is a very important feature and one of the main reasons i want to switch to parquet 
thanks you for pay attention   jreback i just added the outputs   gfyoung in version 0 22 this behavior does not appear i just added the output with 0 22 version too 
with the latest branch   thanks 
i get an error on python 3 6 5 freshly installed with anaconda on a linux  it works well on python 2 7 14 which was also installed with anaconda on the same system 
i have been poking around through trial and error  the best that i can come up with is that  1  it is for dates only  times seem to be unaffected  2  it seems to work when the frequencies are things like  w mon   which means it just works on "anchored offsets"  i came across  snap  when i was looking for a  round   floor  type method that can handle time changes  i still don't know if  snap  would work  but i know that it doesn't seem to do what i expect based on the little documentation i can find

 gfyoung thank you for your answer  by implicit i mean    i consider that a nan value in an array is a value    that value_counts   is asking for counting the number occurrences of each value    thus since nans are value they should be included in the value_counts   output  the function is implicitly  without clearly stating it  dropping nans    moreover it is opposed to my expectation in terms of behaviour   what's your use case of value_counts     doesn't the benefit of having information about nan values which is very informative about the structure of your data and leads to potential error findings in a data munging use case outweighs the cost of having an additional nan line in the output  
i didn't notice that anaconda's gcc is deprecated  i clean installed  gcc_linux 64  and found newest pandas can be successfully installed  thanks for the support 
i've got a  dataframe  and a collection of functions expecting  series  of various lengths  each returning a  series   of potentially different length  i want to chunk the  dataframe  into various columns   apply  the appropriate functions  and then rejoin the  dataframe   for the most part this works fine  but it gets confused if the function expects a  series  of length 0  that said  even without the above reason  it seems odd to me to treat the trivial case differently to all other cases  it's just bound to cause weird behaviour in edge cases

that’s fair  i get your point  but i’m expecting at least the 0  1  3  4 indexed integers being converted to date times  and  99998 can be left as is  is that something i should be anticipating

certainly there are plenty of ways to avoid it  but many users often prefer to use single line implementations of pandas  rather than wrapping in more python functionality  and i'd probably default overwrite to "ignore' to keep behavior typical  again  the use case here is a typical pandas using data science project in a notebook where a cell may be errantly executed without thinking  the value add is certainly not enormous  and of course someone wishing to be careful could write the check themselves  still  would be convenient
 tomaugspurger i'll see what i can do  it will likely be a few days or more before i can delve deeper into this problem 
this is the spark documentation is saying "spark 2 3 0 works with python 2 7+ or python 3 4+  it can use the standard cpython interpreter  so c libraries like numpy can be used  it also works with pypy 2 3+ " i have written the python code to submit the spark job using spark submit  in code i have used the pandas lib  but the code is failing in python and hence it seems a pandas issues  if you want to replicate it   i can share the more details  pandas internally uses numpy and the error show that the error is in pandas init py"  line 19  file " home harry pandas 0 23 4 cp27 cp27mu manylinux1_x86_64 zip pandas init py"  line 19  in importerror  missing required dependencies  'numpy'  also while submitting the spark submit command in   py files numpy dependency is given

ok  i tried one more time  all dependencies are satisfied 
 willayd our use case is that we have daily reports and one of the columns only contains data when something unusual happened  consequently  in some files this column is completely empty and "the column is completely empty" is exactly the information that we are looking for  the change in #25623 that you referenced mentions csv files  for csv files i agree that the change is very useful  since the csv file really does not contain the column  but for excel files  there is no such thing as a non existing column 
yes  still happens even if i put the column name as a hard coded string in both sides 
thank you  what do you mean by  the code i have provided is all copy paste so it is 100  accurate i e  with that code in my system i can produce this issue  i tried just now in python and ipython on the same env  error comes in notebook  and i can't reproduce either so i think this is somehow related with jupyter notebook  i will report the issue there 
i think this would be perfectly fine  after all the complex numbers is still a float  in this case  and when you have the dot zero format you immediately know that it is a float and not an integer complex number  its the same reason why you have the dot zero format for plain float numbers 
that does help  i think it might be worth calling out explicitly the potential side effects  like locks  so users are clear on the potential impacts 
sorry  my mistake  it should be a series 
yes it requires login  but the registration is completely free  i think it will not be an abuse if i share it temporary for  a couple of hours  https   yadi sk d acztkxzszaqn_w  
i have almost halved the lines of code  i hope it is not too much now  since i am not sure what more to delete and still express the problem sufficiently  would you consider the asserts too much  i put them there because i think they showcase pretty clearly what the issue i have found is 
cannot comply  the machine i have for this has no access to the internet  i did used the latest release on a clean venv   python 3 6 4    anaconda  inc     and the error is there 
json value "3 4" converting as "4 mar" in csv instead of "3 4"
i am not very well versed in profiling methods but i am more than happy to figure it out  do you have any recommended methods  if it makes a difference  i am using google colab  also  i would be happy to provide the notebook i am using  it is self contained  and downloads the data directly from my google drive  so all you have to do is press run and then go to the final cell to check the sql code 
you mean profile this script only or profile "its calling from within pandas source code"  have never heard used  snakeviz  before   will check it to  thanks 
i thought i included a minimal example  i included one section of the dictionary and the code that created the dictionary entries  i 'm pretty sure i did fill out the issue template  is it better now 
hi  sorry  just coming back to this now  in the case of a series that has two or more modes  then the distribution is multimodal  it does not have a single mode  it is up to the user to decide how they wish to handle that in their application problem at hand  i guess it would be neat if the could return the array of modes when there is more than one  with regards the issue above  i would just have expected the same behavior answers as what 0 22 0 gave  why the change of behavior from 0 22 0 to 0 24 2  incidentally  i happened to notice this same issue is present in 0 25 0
i'm using pandas 0 24 2  i also tried with pandas 0 25 0 and obtained the same issue  installed versions                    commit  none python  3 7 3 final 0 python bits  64 os  linux os release  5 0 0 050000 generic machine  x86_64 processor  x86_64 byteorder  little lc_all  none lang  en_us utf 8 locale  en_us utf 8 pandas  0 24 2 pytest  4 3 1 pip  19 0 3 setuptools  40 8 0 cython  0 29 6 numpy  1 16 2 scipy  1 2 1 pyarrow  none xarray  none ipython  7 4 0 sphinx  1 8 5 patsy  0 5 1 dateutil  2 8 0 pytz  2018 9 blosc  none bottleneck  1 2 1 tables  3 5 1 numexpr  2 6 9 feather  none matplotlib  3 0 3 openpyxl  2 6 1 xlrd  1 2 0 xlwt  1 3 0 xlsxwriter  1 1 5 lxml etree  4 3 2 bs4  4 7 1 html5lib  1 0 1 sqlalchemy  1 3 1 pymysql  none psycopg2  2 7 6 1  dt dec pq3 ext lo64  jinja2  2 10 s3fs  none fastparquet  none pandas_gbq  none pandas_datareader  none gcsfs  none
hi   jorisvandenbossche sorry for the delay  context  we don't want to pass the database parameters into connection configs  connection creation   because  1  we have prod and dev databases 2  this treatment is done somewhere else in the code 3  the correct database should be passed via schema_name setting schema 'prod_raw ecs_marketing' also doesn't work  so  basically i have 3 questions  1  why is it performing an select in information_schema  2  why table schema is in lower case and table_name in upper case in select statement  3  why it works with  if_exists   replace   and not when  if_exists   append  
i find the problem  my code is like 
just like to_csv   and to_excel   have an "encoding" parameters  we can have an encoding parameter in string for consistency 
i've uploaded the information requested 
i think i added the lines that can reproduce this behavior  not sure if it is missing  here it is  #sample residual pcts residuals_pct   0 044516001 0 031137117 1 06758e+64 0 003522454 0 065171486 0 06033751 0 01325514  0 005620799  0 006225719 0 045713825 0 039280786 0 000531307  #creating a dataframe with residual percent d   pd dataframe residuals  columns  'residual_pct'   #shifting the pct 1 row down  d 'residual_pct_shift'    d residual_pct shift 1  #calculating the adjusted residual pct  d 'adj_residual_pct'    d 'residual_pct_shift'  3   rolling window 3  mean  
 tomaugspurger i don't actually know how to find that pr  thanks for the suggestion  dsaxton  i have indeed worked around this issue  so my question is maybe more philosophical    if i take a sample of bananas is it okay to return no bananas  this feels wrong to me  but i can not articulate what the problem is exactly 
in case its of interest i used chardet as suggested in the below which uses it if encoding is not specified  reading the first kb to determine encoding  this obviates the unfortunate situation wherein reading a utf 16 as utf 8 does not generally throw an error  but will munge up the data 
ill check for that  thanks 
if you can reproduce the problem at 0 25 3 but not at master  i think we can call this closed as already fixed  if not  i'm going to need your help on how to build the master version as i've not done it before 
thank you for the quick follow up  tomaugspurger  running your suggested code   conda create  n pandas 1 0 0rc0  c conda forge label rc  c conda forge pandas  1 0 0rc0  pandas 1 0 0rc0 installs okay  then trying to install jupyterlab to run pandas in a jupyter notebook fails with 
'0 25 3' thank you for yr advise and i will try other version later 
confirmed  fixed in 1 0 0rc0  thanks for the quick response 
 zzapzzap i'm using pandas 1 0 1 as shown in the output of  pd show_versions     the problem is definitely with  df2  and  int64   because that's the one throwing the error 
i dont think it is a bug   but it is a new request 
i just created a new environment and i'm getting the below error   mldev demdep   home demo by dem  conda activate daskdup  daskdup   mldev demdep   home demo by dem  import pandas as pd import  unable to open x server  '   error import c importimagecommand 369 
updated with reproducable example
hi  tomaugspurger thank you for the advice  the tests really helped me for understanding the code design  closing this issue  cheers 
actually it is a numpy problem  because i cannot import numpy  anyway i have solved the issut by using pandas from conda forge channel  i don't know what is the difference but now it works

yeah  setting it to a new dataframe  or using inplace true  works  idk why that didn't occur to me  i have to keep header none because sometimes i get the same file with a weird header  like because they wanted to make it 'pretty'  and othertimes not  thanks very much 
ok  https   github com sensio sensiogeneratorbundle issues 86
yeah i wasn't sure if it needed to be reviewed as a patch first  i'll make a pull request for it instead 
 nicolas grekas there are no errors  if i comment the dump  everything works perfectly fine  external request  i send a post request to my controller that runs that service  the page is just a view with one button to run the process    9oq81j6  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 243674 13526508 97b90c3a e208 11e5 9e79 91139e8c88d7 png 
i'm using php 7 0 8 3 
tested #21562  there is now a behavioural difference with respect to the previous released version  using my own example  a null  accountid  and a non null  tenantuuid  used to always pass validation  even if in the db there was already a record with null  accountid  and the same  tenantuuid   the same scenario now fails validation  i'm not sure which is the most correct behaviour  but merging this will cause a small bc break 
 schmittjoh fails with same error with both  pre  providers  in_memory  users  '70'    password  pass  roles  'role_user'     pre  and  pre  providers  in_memory  users  "70"    password  pass  roles  'role_user'     pre  if you look at prototypedarraynode it checks  pre  if   isset  v  this  keyattribute      is_int  k       pre  so its always true for numbers and throws exception  i don't see a good reason for checking is_int    thanks 
i haven't know about this option  can you please suggest how my code should be changed to use it 
exactly  throwing accessdeniedhttpexception is correct  but this should lead to a 403 response 
ok  i didn't find the similar issue #6866   blame it on me  i used the search  both google and github  + browsed opened issues and failed to find it  i apologize for being part of the human species  this being said  as  bendavies said  the comment posted by  tobion was not very helpful  now  back to this issue  which really actually was #6864   it was supposed to be fixed fifteen days ago and merged into 2 2  so it could be a regression or perhaps the thing never got fixed properly in the first place  i'll link to this issue in that discussion 
hi  stof  yes  looks like a duplicate of #2309  thanks 
not really on specific pages  for example  it also appears on the profiler ajax request     fatal in firebug   we deal with a lot of sub requests    10 20  and odm orm queries  10 10 queries per page max   i don't think it's a doctrine2 related problem as i got the same error in a propel symfony2 project  which does not have any sub request   btw  the next hit  after the fatal error  is ok  maybe an environment related problem    i'm using a vm with centos  php   libs up to date + xdebug 
 nicolas grekas sure  i created a symfony 3 4 6 project here   https   github com emmanuelvella symfony you can use docker to bootstrap it   docker build    t symfony docker run   rm  v " pwd"  var www html  p 8000 8000  d   name symfony symfony docker exec symfony composer install then go to http   localhost 8000 app php interesting parts are the  controller  https   github com emmanuelvella symfony blob master src appbundle controller defaultcontroller php#l24  and the  template  https   github com emmanuelvella symfony blob master app resources views default index html twig#l10   it seems that the firewall causes the session to start  and the response is then marked as private  does it means i need to exclude all my esi actions from the firewall   with firewall    cache control  max age 0  must revalidate  private  s maxage 60  without firewall    cache control  public  s maxage 60

i'm using 76ef8da030b7bee4751790fd0666cacd3ca3278b but not that familiar with phpunit yet  i disabled my form theme  but the labels are still just numeric 
php 5 6 8 in my composer json  i added  and ran  composer update symfony phpunit bridge  to install it  then the errors occured when running  phpunit  c app   removing the bridge afterwards makes the tests pass again 
for the other who got the same error  i find the solution  right now  each bundle that uses assetic needs to be explicitly registered in your  app config config yml   see this  issue  https   github com symfony asseticbundle issues 32  for more details 
 nicolas grekas  after a discussion on slack  i've tried what you recommended without success 
 stof and  fabpot understood the problem  let me try again to clarify but tbh my brain is wrappled into a lot of problem solving in another domain so not sure i can remember exactly  check this one https   github com braincrafted bootstrap bundle pull 362 files i think if you install the bundle and use 2 7 you will see the exception and errors 
i expect routing not to fail  test the following routes on symfony standard    _profiler pkzbenzkiu79guxqk      token not found  ok  expected   _profiler pkzbenzkiu79guxqk 2bao      token not found  ok  expected   _profiler pkzbenzkiu79guxqk 2bao 2f 2bp      no route found for "get  _profiler pkzbenzkiu79guxqk 2bao 2f 2bp   wrong  expected the same as above  p s  i thought that this is another case of double decoding that's why i raised this in #6363
i'm building a bundle  1  that allows a user to authenticate against atlassian crowd and use it's single sign on ability  if the user is logged into crowd  at the point the firewall is triggered and i have to create my token to pass to the authenticationprovider  i don't have any info about the user  not even a username  so i have to create a token with no roles  2   if i continue to extend abstracttoken i seem to be stuck and will not have any ability to add roles to my token once i discover who this user is  alternatively i could simply implement the tokeninterface myself  but abstracttoken provides 99  of what i need  after looking at the code a bit more after i created the ticket i believe overriding getroles is not the correct solution  instead i'd like to add a protected setroles   and then i would override setuser   to call the parent  pull the roles from the user object passed in  and then pass them to  this  setroles     1  https   bitbucket org asaayers crowdbundle  2  https   bitbucket org asaayers crowdbundle src 876f60c9336a security firewall ssolistener php#cl 40
i had to refactor some code for a different issue  which solved this issue as well  maybe i overlooked something  since i cannot reproduce this anymore  i'll close this issue 
i have several usecases  i need a parser where all numbers and strings are parsed trough some function of my own  i also would like to tweak the parser to allow strings without quotation marks as in some of my use cases i do not need variables  i might want to add my own operators  the first 2 use cases can be achieved easily if one could overwrite the parseprimaryexpression   in the parser  i understand my use cases might be rare  however  being unable to change anything in the current classes makes nothing of those use cases possible 
jupp  give me some time until tomorrow evening  got to work on those other two tickets i wanted to create pull requests for too 
i use this forms via javascript ajax submit to api controller  wich expects to see single form
i think this behavior is not intuitive   maybe some warning must be given  
 michelsalib the use case is simple  i update some translation file  for example slovak   after some time a new validation feature come to symfony  this feature request new translation messages  but the author of this change update only some language files  i'm not watching those files  because i'm interseted in languages that i can translate  other xliff files miss new messages  as time goes  a lot of messages are not translated and are missing  it would be easier to see the changes  it those new messages will be added to every translation files   in default english format   stof fallback feature is not working as a whole  if i have location set to slovak and the slovak translation file is present  will be some messages displayed in french and others in slovak because slovak translation file miss some few translations  it will be displayed in english because this language is a base language for each translation  so the idea is to add these english messages into all current translation files  it will work same  or i'm wrong  i saw the proces of adding defualt messages to translation files in  sonataadminbundle  https   github com sonata project sonataadminbundle   another option will be to create tool to show missing translations   for example  kcfinder has some  http   kcfinder sunhater com langeditor el  or some notification system to all translators 
 tobion yes  i undestand your point of view  i'm pretty sure that this is the first time  that the  optionsresolver  blew up on my code  i don't think that there are lot of normalizers on sub options yet  i'd guess that this could cause  heahdude yes  i already implemented a workaroud as we've got some further code to handle select2 in  buildview  of our base  choicetypeextension   i moved the  attr  resolving into that block  i don't know if where the options resolving for form types is documented  adding a hint on this issue could prevent users from stumbling upon this

i agree without a ldap in hands to work with what i say may be a little bit too much abstract  so here is an example   sorry for long post  https   files nekland fr potato sorry long post webp    let's consider this fixtures   but my user entity also contains firstname and lastname fields    which are not retrieved by the default ldapuserprovider  besides it's  kinda  standard to use  gn  and  cn  for that purpose   here are solutions i see with the current implementation of the ldapuserprovider    copy pasting the whole code and adding mine  also returning another kind of user and maybe removing the custom ldap provider that i write before    adding a new decorator that calls ldap again with same query  stupid but working  but what looks best here would be to be able to extend the ldapuserprovider to me  especially because there's a   loaduser     https   github com symfony symfony blob 9bfa25869adab00162c246f4b76d65ca3b78e41a src symfony component ldap security ldapuserprovider php#l149  method protected  which is great  but all attributes are private                                             understandable  adding  final  keyword should be considered then  it would indicate the way of working with this provider  and the protected method should be removed as well 
in fact this case appear when you click on the button to switch to other user right  and you back immediatly on the previous page  by clicking with your mouse or the back button of the browser  and change for an other user  because you wrong  
just to be coherent with bundle resources folders  nothing more 
honestly i'm not sure i will have the needed time and skill  i don't know  findstr  at all for instance  to work on this  i opened the issue mainly as a feature request and for discussion  i'd be glad to help when if i can though   
for example  with such an entity   a restaurant can decide to automatically assign a level to its customers based on their number of reservation  if so  it can set different levels  bronze  silver and gold  so  if   iscutomerlevelauto  is true  i have to check that  levelbronze   levelsilver   levelgold   i put a constraint on the restaurant to check this and add violations  but because this constraint is added before propertyconstraints  i don't know if i have valid integer for each level  that's why i would like to choose the priority between the different constraints  but maybe i do it wrong  is there another way to check this case

hi tobias  if by an upgrade you mean  php composer phar update   i did it 1 hour before modifying autoload php and making this error  so i was at last commit of 2 8 x dev  i deleted the dev folder  but blank page stayed  then launched the command line i mention in my post and it displayed the error in my cmd window  when i solved the error  no more blank page  cheers 
i am not sure pdo is the problem in this case  simply adding the  statement did the trick in my case  at least  the schema create command could do it's work after that 
 bschussek i think not really  the way the guessers work is  that there is the  formtypeguesserchain  with several guessers registered  the  guess  with the best confidence wins  so we have only the option from the guess winner  i am not wan't hook into the form type guess wokflow  i wan't modify set some options for the type  and in my view the required  min and max options should not depends on the guess process  there are not relevant for that  they should be moved into a post event or into a post process 
i highly doubt that class name can include space or new line  the method that throws an exception explicitly checks for class names and not some arbitrary parameter   
hello  vicb  it's my fault  i've defined the fallback and default locale as the same 
i didn't an in depth analysis  but for what i saw i think not 
2 2 x imho error suppression is suitable here
actually my twig only contains this line of code  for testing purpose      form_widget form     which basically renders a collection of inputs  data comes from the database   http   pastehtml com view bvdrgh9aj txt
i know this is not something very important  and there are very few cases where this is necessary  but i think it would be great to provide a standarized mechanism to give the bundle another name instead of picking  without giving any choice  the class name  in the end  it's a matter of choice  and i think that when i develop for a framework  i should be given any possible ways of customizing it  whether it makes sense or not 
my composer json
no  i didn't confuse those parameters  right now i'm not at home so i can't upload the stack trace  i don't understand why is that error beign thrown    2014 11 26 9 01 gmt 05 00 christian flothmann notifications github com

 bamarni   stof  did you need something from me  as i said before i just download the release from www symfony com  uncompress and try i didn't touch nothing at code level so if there's any mistake is presented here at git or in the  tgz file 
 phansys yes  i checked through  lang  parameter in the layout  and running the command you leave get this error   stof "does not work" means that it works for a few translated strings but for the rest it doesn't  for example this translation    'registro natural paneltitulo' trans    works  but this one    'campos tipotramite' trans    doesn't  both are in the same  messages es yml  file  i have no translation domains created or something else  furthermore i'm using  jstranslationbundle  https   github com willdurand bazingajstranslationbundle blob master resources doc index md  and the same issue happens  some strings are translated  some not
yes it does return a collection  actually i'm looking for the following behavior  select optgroup label "category 1" option subcategory 1option       optgroup      select i read that on symfony 2 1  the group_by would do the trick thank you

 stof there are getters for quite a few of those properties  having a rather long statement like the one you suggested  in order to have defaults   which are specified when creating the request instance by the way  is another argument for a short getter in my eyes   at least for such a rather common use case 
it's ox 10 7 4  symfony 2 1 0 dev  php 5 4 3 with apc  imagick  intl  mongo and yaml extensions  it happens on the start  immediately  so the server does not start at all 
thanks  it fixed it 
 stof   good job     ini_set 'xdebug max_nesting_level'  100      bad   ini_set 'xdebug max_nesting_level'  101      good
the problem is non obvious behavior  to me  it seemed that by default  all should be escaped  no matter tag or filter  it turns out that the   trans  and     trans     doing a few different things  why do i need to translate the executable code  for example  the     trans    h3 foo  h3    endtrans     as stated in the documentation  in real life most likely would have been   h3    trans   foo   endtrans     h3   
for field image required is set to true  but if i don't fill this field in form then isvalid   return false and form render error message 
ok i  see  https   github com symfony symfony commit 8c6b7a49126df8ad7d54f88f9f397fe403ad891d   i use 2 1 2 version and i don't have this bugfix  thanks for your answer 
problem is fixed with  https   gist github com 3607658
i'm working on the fixes for different branches  the 2 2 branch is over  did the pull request  now is time for the 2 3   since intldateformattertest was written differently there 
i'm not sure exactly what  xabbuh is referring to  so hopefully he can provide a testcase demonstrating his concerns  all i could provide is a test case showing that the setter is called over the removed adder 
 stof exactly  instead of iterating along the fallback chain  it would determine the sequence of locales to be checked and then consult each of these catalogues in turn 
i ment the concept   not really then lets say   em  persist  this  get 'security context'   gettoken    getuser      em  flush    same story   have done this since the start of symfony 2   and suddently it does not work anymore   but i will make a fork  and replicate the bug  
not yet   for whatever reason a very simple example doesn't do this   which is what i would expect  i just can't see why its happening for me  if this happened all the time  everyone  would be filing a bug 
i have tried 2 1 4 and master
hi  i'm using the 2 1 4 release from symfony website  downloaded couple of days ago  i will pull the latest commits later today and check for this issue and update this ticket  thanks 
 javiereguiluz that is great  thank you for referring to that  feel free to close this issue 
sorry i haven't responded  fabpot  i had this issue on a finished project and haven't had time to revisit it  i was using 2 1 7  if it comes up for me again i will try to track it down and try to give more insite into the potential issue 
to my great shame  it was my fault  the date was modified because i was calling   date  add    inside a repository  those methods modify the passed object  by reference    and   return it  it is to note that variables seem to be passed by reference to repositories  while debugging  i encountered another issue _ an array was returned  and not some datetime _  however i was not able to replicate it later 
there is no extra configuration for assetic  it's all in  config yml  as described above 
hi  i think  choice_loader  has priority  https   github com symfony symfony blob 5129c4cf7e294b1a5ea30d6fec6e89b75396dcd2 src symfony component form extension core type choicetype php#l411
 stof yep  i meant returning another element of the array  returning the full array would be done by solution 1  which adds a completely new method  avoiding the current method's signature to change  unfortunately  from what i've understood of #7312  it does not seems to fix my issue  because i have no idea of what kind of ips will be in the x forwarded for because of the multi cdn structure in place  there's not even a range of ips i could filter on  they really are unknown and non guessable  so i can't use the trusted_proxies option  i don't know all the history behind the security issue that has been solved by the trusted_proxies option  but is the "array_pop" a part of the solution to it   if not  then it shouldn't block the second suggestion  if it does  then i don't know how i could solve my issue without touching this line  and any other suggestion would be more then welcomed   about the 3th option  is it really a bc break to add a new optional parameter to a function   i thought it wasn't  we could have something like this   https   gist github com gnutix 5144860  i'm not very used to closures  so the code example is probably not perfect or even working   it's just to give you an idea 
don't know why  after updating some bundles this error disappeared    thanks   
thanks for quick reply  tobion and  stof i don't think we've made any significant configuration changes  i did a grep over our code base and outside of symfony core  getroutecollection  is only called in  allowedmethodsrouterloader php  of fosrestbundle version 0 10 0  we did implement a custom router  for subdomains  but it does not alter the behavior of  getroutecollection   at the moment we're wondering if this misbehaviour could be related to subdomains anyway in which case using symfony 2 2 should solve this  maybe  
i'll try to create a symfony project reproducing this bug  will be back in a few minutes 
 stof i cleared the cache now  can reply you later   javiereguiluz is not my case  dont use http cache  use render_esi to render blocks but not cache http properly  no doctrine cache  this is a large system  253 tables 23 proprietary bundles  but is used by few users  around 300  and few external daily accesses  it's worrying me because soon you will have a lot of external access
only fosuserbundle 
of course  i'm just not sure about the wanted behavior  can we just accept  null  values in  setmessageid    method 
i'm not too great with colors myself and just throwing ideas out here  but if you want to have a theme that is similar to the symfony documentation you could use this  on the very right is a set of colors i found in the css file    vardumper theme  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 2244480 4817744 b7347b0e 5eeb 11e4 8c6a 8f6813c76f81 png 
that's why it's confusing because after        comes    command_name     when i do    help  i expect help on the entire console app  not help on help  i would expect to get this with the following syntax   symfony   help help   see also previous point that using    help  i expect information on the app     help  should give information on which commands there are and a short description of them  otherwise it's pretty useless help  that mainly seems to give help on itself  see previous 2 points   i see also  you can also output the help in other formats by using the   format option  no it doesn't because that information should come when you do  console   help  not  console list 
migrating from 2 1 to 2 3  updated bundles a minute ago  problem still exists 
 hacfi we are using fosuserbundle for user management  our session is cached in memcache 
it happens f e  when    the fos http cache bundle route used to generate a user_hash is protected by a firewall rule  and sf http cache is on   which then will trigger the subrequest to  _fos_user_context_hash when the user visits  login    in an ezpublish application  one of the controllers used for subrequests tries to load a content from the repository which the user does not have access to
this happened in 2 custom bundles  so it's easy to fix  as far as i can tell  the exceptions are 100  legit  just shouldn't break compatibility with with 3 3
master  but if you look well  the composer json in  src symfony component httpkernel  is not in sync with the composer json in       which is actually fixed in the pull request  running  composer install   dev   or  composer update   from the  src symfony component httpkernel  means that the templating component won't be fetched  and thus  the tests will fail when running  phpunit   i suspect that there are other similar issues with the other components  but i don't have the time right now to fix every composer json file in symfony symfony
sure  as composer i'm using this one  "symfony symfony"  "2 3  "       "minimum stability"  "stable"  let me know if something   
don't really know  insight support told me they use symfony yaml parser component 
symfony 2 3 3  full stack 
 nicolas grekas yes  here is a broken app   https   github com nykopol broken app you just have to go to the default controller  i noticed that this only occur if the listener depends on  doctrine orm entity_manager  
it does make some sense but ultimately these things are still sort of metadata and not a direct part of the command or event  moreover they are usually only added to the message later and not right away  adding such metadata as a stamp makes more sense then creating a new instance of command event  because those are obviously immutable   i did store them in a   metadata  array inside the message until now but using stamps for such metadata makes much better sense to me  so ultimately i would only end up with having a second layer of stamps inside the message and the message would become a second envelope for the real command or event  when adding a new stamp later it would become difficult to figure out which layer it belongs to       for example in the regards of event sourcing i found out that i very much dislike the concept of commandhandler classes that load the aggregate identified by the command from eventstore  call a method on that aggregate to generate new events and save those events to eventstore again  such as this  example  https   github com prooph proophessor do blob master src model todo handler reopentodohandler php#l32 l43  from prooph   this was exactly the same useless code over and over in all commandhandlers which also became difficult to test as a result  so i got rid of commandhandlers completely and have one handler that handles all commands  now when refactoring the application to symfony messenger it would make sense to refactor this command handler to a middleware and have the aggregates themselves become command handlers  the middleware would load the current aggregate state  add it as a stamp and send it to the next middleware  handlemiddleware  and after the inner middleware is done it would save the events from handledstamp to eventstore  does this make sense  the catch of course is that the handler called by handlemiddleware would need to have access to the aggregatestatestamp   which is currently impossible  note  in my case aggregatestate is a value object separate from the class with the aggregate's logic  this was not the case in many eventsourcing examples but it works really well for me  aggregatestate has an apply method for each event while aggregate has methods that receive command + aggregatestate and yield events 
sure  i'll give it a try  the only thing bothering me is how the twig service should be declared though if there is no bundle  declaring it locally to the profiler     more specifically for its configuration  cache        but i'll try to figure that out    
one must override  getcachedir    and  getlogdir    in appkernel to set the cache log directories  the only way to use this with memcache would be to write a custom stream wrapper  additionally  in the filesystem component   one of the methods utilized by the cache  https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component filesystem filesystem php#l451  calls the  app engine restricted  tempnam  function  https   developers google com appengine docs php #php_disabled_functions   rendering it useless 
i dont know what went wrong  but after i cleared the cache complettly  i checked it again and the error was gone  as i already described  it happened for a simple collection with more than one field  in form type  after i added asserts to each field  so if someone have the same error in the future  clear the cache   
i wrote a simple 'unit test' that triggers the same bug and almost the same fatal error call to undefined method closure  getwrappedlistener    in the symfony version i'm using  i have to figure out which versions are affected  after that i'll send a pr
no  as i don't want to touch license file which are very specific and imho should only be handled by project leaders

i am currently using the ldap firewall with a database provider  the provider checks if the user exists in the database  then ldap firewall checks if he exists in the ldap  my problem is that it seems to not be possible to check multiple dn strings on the ldap 
i am trying to create a test but i am not able to make it working  in  symfony component form tests extension validator constraints formvalidatortest  i would like to create a form with a single field and submit it a blank value  in order to check if the  notblank  constraint is properly working  then we should have to change the submit by   form  submit array    false    to reproduce the issue 
it was a twig extension to get the locale full name  can't exactly remember how i got it  but worked on my computer  i'll check 
point taken  although it's a shame similar code has to be written a few times  i actually found a use case for it outside of symfony  in my application code  but didn't look into the subtleties 
 cordoval   it was in a function definition  so technically a parse error that couldn't evaluate to false   jakzal   i'm no longer able able to reproduce the error  and i've changed my xdebug configuration a few times since i reported this  so if that may indeed have had something to do with it  i'll close this for now and re open if it ever shows up again 
unfortunately  i coudn't find any study saying what portion of production applications are deployed in a debian like environment  i think a large part is  the 2012 study concentrates on the development environment  the production environment would also be interesting  maybe  but this is not only a "disk full of inodes" problem  also a security one  because a session that is never garbage collected can be reused anytime  correct me if i'm wrong  but i think there is no check of the file mtime when the session is loaded  my sessions are reloaded without a glitch a few days later with the famous "well this is embarassing" firefox page  the session save_path is redefined  why not also define a default session gc_probability   this can  and should  of course  be configured  and a cron task might be more appropriate in environments where such small optimizations are required 
i've solved it  i had an error creating the form  assigning the events  thanks anyway   
with patch 46fdfbb  https   github com romainneutron symfony commit 46fdfbbdef430ae98a458d581235d4cba0e42a68  is ok 
i've just got reports that the cache is not invalidating properly  i'm afraid that the tags are indeed not saved  possibly the warning is correct  although i've yet to find out why the cache entries are written correctly  but the tag cache entries are not  perhaps one of the caches is not able to process the  null  byte    u0000    perhaps the bug description is wrong  but it's a bug in saving tags instead  i'll try to further debug this later this week 
in symfony2 i read sessions as follows    session    this       getsession    get 'key'   please stay with me   i've been struggling for 27 hours now    when i save sessions to memcached   do i have access to them as the normal way or should i use something else  
yes  "e s_us" is not a valid locale  i found the problem from error log of nginx  it means that client can send the invalid locale  may it cause some issues

hi  jakzal  thanks for replying  might be that it is because i use yml files for translation   also  i think that this problem only happends on 2 3 18 version      didn't do much special to my project     sorry don't have much experience reporting bugs  i'll try to fork the 2 3 18 and reproduce the problem 
 weaverryan no problem  this is my authenticate function  in a class implementing simpleformauthenticatorinterface   it's pretty much a copy and paste from the docs  with a few tweaks  that flood shield  soon to be renamed  simply logs errors and handles brute force attempts 
hi  jakzal yep  i solved this using custom data transformer 
the  library  https   github com klaussilveira gitter blob master lib gitter client php#l69  builds the command line itself and passes it as a string to the  process  constructor

ok  maybe it would be best to specify  ""  passing case as valid on http   symfony com doc current components console console_arguments html page  right now just from reading the docs i can't tell that required argument means argument presence is required  but value can be empty   wouterj   i haven't found any examples of validation on command level  extending  argvinput  just to override  validate  method doesn't seem like a good idea  other ways to introduce application wide validation logic change

fine  pr updated 
 timglabisch your question is the exact issue i was asking about  why does symfony try to connect to the database   apparently it's because symfony doesn't know what version of the database server you're using and it's connecting in order to find out 
 iltar i updated the previous comment with the whole destruct method for review  can you explain what you mean with "_write stream_"  you mean the handle  is it possible to unlink   the file before releasing the lock  as in the second so example  that would prevent race conditions   maybe even a blocking lock    the moment we get the lock  we need to check if the inode of the file on disk is the same as the one from our handle 
code 
here is a rough example  hope it makes sense  https   gist github com pharman d5150b997eb87257ed58 i appreciate that it's possible to define a factory service  but to me it feels like it could be provided at framework level 
 jaytaph i would gladly provide it  however there is nothing added to dev log
sure  wanted to confirm it makes sense before i start

i persist the formcomponents "date" and "time" in sql as date and time  so there is no timezone information needed  stof is right  doctrine will translate me the date or time to an php  datetime object  because php could not known do better  i think this object will be created with the server default timezone  with commit 1 https   github com symfony symfony commit 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53 my form looks like this    builder  add 'utcdate' 'date' array 'required'  false     is always utc  the form will give me back a datetime object with utc timezone  now i have the problem that for doctrine the entity has been modified  because of the timezone offset  to fix this problem  a add two new doctrine dbal types "utcdatetype" + "utctimetype" witch will translate the database values to an php  datetime object with utc timezone  this solution worked perfekt for me  no more problems with timezones for time date components and the server default timezone can be changed at any time  with the changes of commit 2 https   github com symfony symfony commit 1c4a75a00a86df3e17979be86bddaafc108daf98 the form will create the php  datetime object with the server default timezone again and the timeoffset ist back again    should be no problem  with commit 3 https   github com symfony symfony commit 1c4a75a00a86df3e17979be86bddaafc108daf98 i will use the option "view_timezone" to get it back in utc    builder  add 'utcdate' 'date' array 'required'  false 'view_timezone'  'utc'     but this did not work  i am new to symfony  so i am realy not sure  i think the options "model_timezone" and "view_timezone" are missing in f e  line 60+61 in file https   github com symfony symfony blob 2 6 src symfony component form extension core type datetype php before commit 1 https   github com symfony symfony commit 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53 the two options are present with       options 'model_timezone'    options 'view_timezone'       and now  https   github com symfony symfony commit 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53      null null       hopefully  i am not totally wrong    and sorry for the bad english   
could be solution and should technically be possible  but do we want this  what do you think  fabpot  
looks like using  uri "http   serversforhackers com" over rode the http_host and thinking about it now  that makes sense  my test is not an accurate portrayal of what an http request received behind a proxy would look like  creating my rest request like this    request   request  create 'http   localhost 8888 tag proxy' 'get'           serveroverrides null    generated fully passing tests   it seems i "broke" the request class by not "implementing http correctly"  or   as a real world case would be  in my test request  seems reasonable that the request class shouldn't cover http being done wrong on my end  d thanks for pointing these out to me  really appreciate your time 
yeah if it's configurable in some way  that is fine  or maybe  declare queue on publish   
you are right  i mixed up  menu_name  and  menuname  thus i added  menu_name  into form  i was getting no error since no  menu_name  property existed  thanks guys 
 ocramius very naive and  overly   demanding comment on my part  i don't feel right that i have to be wary of using the final keyword just because of the way my class is registered to a dic  i've already faced this issue several times when using doctrine  i always felt very annoyed by that 
i might have misunderstood this completely  and confused the request value resolver with the actual request on the request stack  i think i'll use the paramconverter and turn the request content into a entity instead  but just out of curiosity  if one would like to dynamically override the request class  how would one do that  use the event cycle to swap the request  or should you just never override it  editing index php  a framework specific file  don't seem like a good idea
thanks for your feedback  i'll try to get my hands on it  probably not before july 8th  if the timing is ok for you i'll update the test suites and then try to fix it  the router being a complex component  maybe i'll ask for some help  thanks
nothing's finished but i began  this  https   github com symfony symfony compare master   guilhemn tags   i made a class per tag and it resulted to 
 ro0nl i don't think it's a problem  everything that worked before will still work 
 xabbuh run the method in a loop    ceil 61 60   will produce 2  the method should be using  floor  but doing so is still incorrect since the loop iteration has already passed the singular form 
no  i've checked 2 6 4  and that version is fine  also  i've checked 2 7 x dev  and the same error occurs there  although the output is slightly different with 2 exceptions shown instead of one   btw  forgot to mention  but all of this is using php 5 5 11 on windows 8 1
so the problem probably lies in the fact that the supervisor processes still look at the old container folder  in memory problem  
 xabbuh yes but that sounds like a workaround too  i can't think of a use case where it's useful to merge fallbacks  thinking 
you want some reading   have fun and thanks a lot 
not on this field  here is the field on the form  
sorry if bad explained  i validate with group  'electronic'  'register'     what happens     on properties  only  assert containing group 'electronic' are triggered  notblank on programname is not validated  because it has only 'register' group    expected     all  assert containing either 'electronic' or 'register' group should be triggered 
 xabbuh sorry  i've just realised that this only affects checkboxes under the bootstrap layout   could you please give it another go  if you're still unable to reproduce it  i'd be happy to provide that fork 
i agree that ignoring an error is quite fragile  but when you already know about the well known errors in one of your dependencies  be notified  stopping the execution through a  contexterrorexception   about these unfixable errors everytime doesn't help  please  note that i'm not proposing to not collect those errors  but just not throwing an exception for them  not really  sometimes old libraries seems to become abandoned and have very old prs trying to fix these kind of issues and there is nothing i could do about that  at least  not without maintaining a fork with the fixes by my own  
 v2 12 0   but twig is working fine with that syntax  the only problem i've found is with the  lint twig  command 
no i don't  no data transformers and no listeners subscribers  however the primary key of my entity   car   is special
 stof actually there was something really strange  because  composer show 'symfony  '  was saying my  symfony http kernel  is 4 1 1 but i've found out that in  composer lock  i had 4 1 1  in  symfony lock  i had 4 0 8 and  symfony component httpkernel kernel  version  was 4 0 8  and it was displayed on dev welcome page   i had removed both lock files  whole  vendor  dir  run  composer update  from scratch and now it's ok   4 1 1 is displayed on welcome page and profiler works  really  really weird 
 tobion i use symfony 2 7 1 i don't have a custom form theme and i don't want to use one  the disadvantage is that the whole  form_label  widget has to be overriden  if symfony changes the logic  i have to change it  too  it's too much overhead  and i also don't override any existing form block  the current  form_label  widget contains the logic for not rendering labels  if label is set to false  so an extra condition to  translation_domain  false  is enough for all labels   choice_translation_domain  false  doesn't work  because it will only override the original  translation_domain  in the form view  the template logic is not affected 
 xabbuh symfony version 2 8 3  jakzal yes  it seems to be the issue 
correct  i have not been able to recreate the bug in native  so far  but i will be running the servers on native for a few days to see if it shows up for anyone 
 nicals sure  it annoys me every day   
sure  the hardest part is actually providing unit test for this  since now i know exactly what is happening i think the shortest example which can be included in test suite is this   wdyt 
i have a few dozens commands and a single input handler that is responsible for preprocessing questions before passing them to question helper  for instance  default value can be callable that takes answers of previously asked questions as a parameter  i need to  invoke  https   github com chi teck drupal code generator blob 66de5db0e6177171c5e3791e7f4a0a43bd047145 src helper inputhandler php#l92  the callable and put the result back to question object  another case is  formatting  https   github com chi teck drupal code generator blob 66de5db0e6177171c5e3791e7f4a0a43bd047145 src helper inputhandler php#l125  question text 
 dmaicher  yes  i did  it works fine with command tester  i need the same for application tester 
i had to re read the docs a couple of times  i think it isn't clear at all about this  i added the  classname  so my groupsequence always returns an array with this group and all works  i think the docs should be clearer about this that when using groupsequences  and not returning the  classname  simply doesn't validate the asserts without any group assigned to them  if i have time ill try some rewording myself 
hi thanks for your time and comments actually i was thinking of this feature when i was working on my project and debuging my app with my log we have some specific monolog channels  cart  where we log the cart add item or cart validation during the checkout process and finding the actual cart channel was hard  indeed i do cmd+f for that hope my explanations are more precises
 aitboudad yup  #15527 fixes the issue for me
i know this cannot be solved with code  but it can be clarified in the docs  which is a bit vague at the moment  and i know it isn't symfony's job to tell me how to organize a webserver  but as i read the docs it doesn't feel like a proper solution now 
 nicolas grekas i will try to check what i can do  the project is huge with so many public and private bundles it does not give me any option to expose the whole thing  i will try to reduce everything to a single  1 file bundle and see if i can reproduce the error from there  best of luck is that i can  which means the issue is due to only long running   if not  then it will be one hell of a task to try disabling each bundle one by one with all the configs that go with them to see which one is the culprit  for sure though  this does not happen before 3 4 19  simply switching back to 3 4 18 fixes it 
hell  it's deeper that i think  thank you for pointing  so i think it's easier for now to workaround than wait for fix   
not per se  the issue  as the error describes  is that the parser thinks the current context is an object node  when it should still be the same array as the previous item was declared in  an empty line should not affect that 
 iltar the route annotation is not working either  the same happens when i put them on class level 
yes in the default config_dev yml in app folder   pre   code monolog  handlers  chromephp  type  chromephp level  info   code    pre 
i expected this was a symfony bug  but it sounds like you're suggesting it's a laravel issue  this selector is generated by laravel's crawlertrait  https   github com laravel framework blob b83830a551 src illuminate foundation testing crawlertrait php#l1044 while the id is invalid  the name selector is the correct name of the form field  so i'd expect it to match 
i will have time to look into this in a couple of weeks  ill get back to you if i still encounter the problem with a more complete example

structurally  that looks right  i can easily understand the syntax  ooi  the  reverse order  option is  inputoption value_none   in my example   would it be necessary to have a new command class  that suggests input processing is done in the command class  maybe a better option would be to have an  inputprocessor  that returns an object obeying  inputinterface

hi  xabbuh i guess that the same repo that i have now will work  https   github com davidgarciacat davidgarcia cat where we can see the setting for  secure  flag here  https   github com davidgarciacat davidgarcia cat blob master config packages framework yaml#l11 there's a docker config file  so you can test it locally inspection for this can be done through observatory as pointed out on the issue's description  https   observatory mozilla org analyze www davidgarcia cat  img width "595" alt "screen shot 2018 03 29 at 16 21 05" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 7809429 38097404 34ef5e2a 336d 11e8 8152 49ab68f2f90e png"   img width "1201" alt "screen shot 2018 03 29 at 16 27 34" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 7809429 38097747 1e966e4c 336e 11e8 9188 b2f91f9c1ae9 png"  hope this helps 
i spend some time with this  removing vendor and do clean install helps    probably something wrong with update  sorry to bother 
i need to install symfony in version 2 8 because of an old php version 5 3 17  when i do this via composer  the bundles are installed according to composer lock  at least the reference for doctrine orm in composer lock is faulty and does not return the requested version  which would be 2 4 8  but the actual one  the actual version requires php   5 4  but symfony 2 8 requires   5 3 9  i hope it's clear now 
i've checkout git master and run composer update to be able to run unit tests  so you have the composer json on your own    
ugh  yes  it is a version problem  build phase lied to me  thanks  folks 
sorry  did not realize this is dupe of https   github com symfony symfony issues 21549 yes  https   github com symfony symfony pull 21556 does fix the issue do you have a recommendation how to fix this temporarily until the new release with this fixed comes 
because php requirement will be fixed in these versions  composer doesn't install dependencies for which you don't fullfill platform criteria 
i think that the only use for this enhancement is when you don't dump the urlmatcher  if i'm not mistaken sf group routes when you dump right 
oh in fact this happened when a symlink is there but the target does not exist  the same should happen when any nondir file is in the path where filesystem  mkdir is to create a dir  we might consider checking this in mkdir and throw a more illuminating exception for better dx   at least  me  is a live example that the current exception can mislead   so title may be  let mkdir exception indicate if a nondir blocks dir creation 
that's fine  do you know if and when this will be released for 4 1 9  
the form should render like this imo   screenshot 2016 04 11 10 43 53  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 165154 14421513 5ac58f28 ffd2 11e5 9ba2 c13a2a62db2e png  these are the form types used  but i' not sure what side effects that will cause   
 alexander schranz y  that's exactly what i was thinking 
 parent  does not work with  _defaults 
i'll try
container of debian gnu linux 9 9  stretch 
well i suppose one of  a  there is a way to clear a requirement  either null  or something else i'm not aware of   the docs should be fixed to mention this  b  there is no correct way to clear a requirement  but using null works to clear a requirement  but it's an unintended effect  this should be adopted and documented  c  there is no correct way to clear a requirement  using null works but should not be relied upon  this is a missing feature 
i do not  but maybe i have something weird in my config    i'll double check it  edit  nope  i used the standard config from symfony standard  so no issues there 
thanks a lot  i forgot to uncomment the config 
 xabbuh that fixed it  thank you 
 jameshalsall but the code i used above returns header 301  and i'm here to discuss if the example above shouldn't be in success class   edit  i meant instead of returning 301  the route component return 200   bhavin nakrani you meant  foo root  if so  all u gotta do is use only   in  route annotation above the action  sorry be this short but type code using tablet is a pain hehe  just add this method to the class example i created in 1st post 
thanks for replies  lyrixx and  ro0nl   what about such essential properties like 'label' that should be shown to the user  where how those should be stored  having label as part of immutable value object looks perfectly legit to me 
 sstok i was just coding up a pr to introduce a new parse flag parse_exception_on_duplicate
i just checked in on  4 1 dev  and it is still reproducible 
the use case is that i consume from a kafka topic and might have to retry the message due to other messages still missing before i can process that very message  so a retry is needed  as kafka is write ahead it doesn't make sense to produce the message to the same kafka topic again as this can screw things up in an event stream  therefor i would need to store the messages to retry somewhere else than in the original kafka topic  unfortunately i'm currently tied to version 4 3 so i can't use the latest 4 4 x dev branch of symfony messenger  any other workaround which works for 4 3 as well 
i could open another pr for that  but if i am reading it right  bugfixes should go to version branches only  perhaps they merge 3 1 back into master from time to time 
the difficulty for me is that i dont know where to start or look  i code in phpstorm 2016 3 and i even cant put breakpoint to stop before redirection 
today latest i think  just checked out from teamcity work dir  here is  28a00dac0c396f2880b84bc33d7abae698d4d94a
the session was not enabled in the  framework session  config    with  everything works as expected on 3 4 beta 2  my fault  but with flex you have to be much more attentive not to forget to enable things  i was testing other stuff so far and didn't think of the session at all 
the  submittype  works without problem  i fixed my problem also by writing this into my  fields html twig   but i just thought that the behavior i encountered is not the desired one  so i opened an issue 
i had a problem installing httpfoundation v3 2 alongside httpkernel v2 8  though  it looks like i'm able to upgrade the httpkernel component to v3 x after all  😃
hi  after investigate more in depth i see the problem come with the  file response   you can found my project here  https   github com nunopress sharex hosting uploader the problem working with  export symfony_env prod  and use the  app php  file when you try to see a files  after cache created  with  return  this  file  file   filename  'inline'      https   files nunopress com view 21 11 2016 1479725953 png i tried too with  return new binaryfileresponse  file  200    but the problem still 
thank you for super quick response   yes  it actually fixes the issue  i will open a pr
dmaicher  thank you for response    after you send body content  at the price of slowing php's output layer a   bit  this is not that case  because headers are sent before the body content  headers_sent function returns true  only when headers were sent  for instance when i do "echo 'text' "  before i output anything  it will return false   i have output_buffering off in php ini   in my case  what is happening  1  header 'content type  text html  charset 'utf 8'   2  headers_sent       returns false 3  header 'content type  text html  charset 'utf 8'   4  echo 'some error'  as a result  header content type is duplicated  i get fcgi error 
 aitboudad closing the issue  since i could not reproduce it in a clean installation of symfony standard edition  most probably i have messed up with something in my configuration  sorry about that   
 nicolas grekas i 've just created this repo that illustrates the problem  excuse my code quality  i tried to do it as fast as i could   https   github com vlahanas urlgeneratortesting you can also see an online illustration of it here  https   url symfony testing herokuapp com  as you can notice  althouth the url is https  the generated url is http 
 lmasforne yep  that error  in one of my test i'm testing user creation  for that i need one user  who is creating new user account  second user  who tests the actual creation by logging in  and in the end first user deletes newly created account  could this error be made not to trigger under test environment at least 
 nicolas grekas i'll try that tonight  currently at work so cannot test that now   
rolling back the changes from #21053 fixes it for me 
yes  related to both  commented in https   github com symfony symfony pull 21556 sorry for the duplicate   
i was only able to reproduce it with this java jar call    actual result    it throws an exception after 60 seconds   expected result    either receiving an exception that the stdin pipe went away instantly after it happens or the class checks if the command is outputting data to stdout or error and handles this  optimum output in this case would be  application pdf  
i tried to replicate the issue and it seems that you have found the solution eg  wrapping call into  profiler_dump    helped  output for     profile getcollector 'request'  requestattributes get '_controller'      is  would you like to fix it or should i fix it and create pull request 
 jakzal when i make default on annotation  work but no in yml   xabbuh i don't no where is problem
 nek  that would be awesome   dmaicher no  it's not   jakzal they are two seperate applications  just think of a reverse proxy setup    symfony rproxy setup  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 737401 24097560 ab9d96b4 0d66 11e7 982a 72cc30bdf1b0 png  since the servers don't have their application in the "root" directory but are in a subdir and there's nothing like  x forwarded path  the generated urls are wrong  so my intention is to only generate the  app_path   in this example  image 4711 small   like mentioned by  nek  and yes  this is kind of a workaround for a missing  x forwarded path  header  hope i could describe my problem 
found the relevant issue there  https   github com symfony symfony docs issues 7526 thanks 
str  1  add   onkernelresponse   listener  2  in this listener  add csp header to   response   instance with directive   style src 'self'     3  load index page in dev mode  with webprofilerbundle   4  open dev tools in chrome  go to   console   tab  actual result  error message from op  expected result  no errors  also  i confirm #20963 isue  hash value in   nonce  hash    directive is not the same as in html    script    tag that loads webprofilerbundle  maybe  this is important in my case 
 dmaicher looks like you're right  i disabled cache in the chrome's dev panel and it works fine with disabled cache     any ideas how to deal with this 
so i looked into writing a test and potentially fixing this  if it were a bug   but actually while looking at the tests surrounding this method it is clear that what i expected this method to do and what is actually does is different  i expected that when using  useattributeaskey 'name'  false   and supply this   note that the key that key was added to the body array even though i didn't manually supply it  anyway after looking in to it i am good with closing this  although i think the above might be a good feature potentially the documentation around the method  especially on the site  should be clearer 
 nicolas grekas it's dumped correctly  but it receive itself  what causes to infinity loop at runtime   getchainpopulatorservice php  
i have to run the compiler pass with the  definitiondecorator  at the  passconfig  type_optimize  stage so that it has access to the doctrine's entity manager  is there any way i can make it work in this case 
 xabbuh  yes it fixes  but with composer update  or install  i've the same file with bug  i think it because a tag v3 3 2 points to previous commit 
# step by step from zero 1  download from symfony com installer 2  do setup 3  manually configure db at    asd app config parameters yml   4  do rapid install 5  add manually to test php  6  try http   localhost asd web app_dev php test 1 edit 7  see error something like that p s  http   localhost asd web config php shows only one notification
 tobion you are right  i just re read it and it does sound confusing  i wanted to explain how this site works and why it is so fast  i did it because  nicolas grekas was interested in that and i don't have a blog  so i am closing it and when i make this as a bundle  i might create new rfc with link only  however i think the idea of autowired service locators  for tagged services  is still something   very   usable and would like to see in the core 
xabbuh  i added just a normal registration form with email  username  password field and locale select  and a register button  i entered normal data nothing special  no german umlaut or special chars   i couldnt really figure out a logic behind that error  it seems to fail random 
hi  xabbuh  i am currently not on my main developer machine  unfortunately  i tried to reproduce the error on another machine  but it failed    everything works   will try again next week on my main machine  in the meantime  if i can not reproduce the error locally  can i conclude that its source may be the environment  e g  php config  instead of symfony  i am wondering  because i didn't use  stderr  myself 
 xabbuh i still work on it  i've started the  stof solution  there's some good evolution but i still need to do some refactoring of the old code
yes i am using   and i was not be able to pass kernelinterface  could write me a clear example  that will be very helpful and kind of you  regards 
 dmaicher i think i told you a way how to reproduce it  run few ajax at the same time  if i add some delay then it works so this is apparently a problem with reading session files at the same time  this behaviour i have on 4 different servers and only after upgrade to sf4 1 i use native symfony session  i didnt introduce nothing by myself   romulused69 i didnt have that section in my framework yml file at all  but i added it and it was the same  then i uncommented it and again the same   
thanks   xabbuh  i want to achieve ajax login   route name  member_login  is  http   www oa com app_dev php mobile member login  when i change  check_path  to another route name it is right  i don't understand how called  check_path  
i copied your code and paste it into symfony 3 3 2  works well  no longer displays a warning 
sorry for bothering you  i've done new tests and there was something else that was not working  the mentioned code works just fine 
hello  the error is trigger when calling   client  request       the parameter   entity  is the expected entity  the  article  object   both properties exist    supplier  and  reference    supplier  is unchanged compared to the fixture   reference  is set to  null  as no data is provided 
that's why i used the generate function mentioned in the docs  so the casing and placement wasn't the issue  i created a project with 3 3 0 and did the same steps without any problems 
yes  too long time in empty controller  why 
the exact order in the templatemanager's  templateexists  is    if the loader implements  twig loader existsloaderinterface   then the  exists    method is called   if the loader implements  twig loader sourcecontextloaderinterface   then the  getsourcecontext    method is called   if neither condition above is met  the  getsource    method is called  this is only present in twig 1 x it was in that last condition that the linked sylius issue was filed from

yes  i am sorry    basically  this question includes all the translatable components of symfony  but the particular issue i've stumbled on was with validator's messages in the form component 
great  thanks for the link  i saw the  "php"  " 7 0 8"  in the composer json file resulted from running the commant  composer create project symfony skeleton    after it breaks because of the php requirement  i will use the slack channel   
thanks for the help  you were right  the problem came from the autoconfigure to true by default  i found a really specific solution to my problem  the ultimate goal is to overwrite the getuser of all controllers   i use getsubscribedservices to have access to one of my services without using di in the constructor  i can remove the declaration of this abstract controller from my services yml   no bug
 curry684 thanks for the response  however after  composer req symfony flex   i'm still not getting the desired  phpunit   any thoughts on what i should do next  thanks 
yup  the same issue  closing

hi  i updated the issue with the code  it's always parsed as an assoc array  so i think it's not a yaml string problem  thanks 
nevermind  i tried using the latest bootstrap 4 released and it works correctly
yes that the solution  thank you   
after thinking about it  the behavior actually makes sense  if there is no templating engine you can not define error pages to be displayed so the fw doesn't know what to return in that case  but the issue of showing the error in the output of phpunit after adding templating still remains 
 curry684 thank you  you are right  extending from  controller  makes full container available  never thought about this 
does #25398 work 
my routes folder contains the following     dev    twig yaml    web_profiler yaml   annotations yaml web_profiler yaml contains the following    i did clear the cache  even if the recipes already perform it   _profiler  also returns a 404
apparently the filter only applies to values fetched from  _env but the argv array is already present in  env from the line   env   getenv     line  yes  i'll provide a reproducer today 
ok  its right datetime  createfromformat   works fine  but new datetime '12 12 201'  throws an exception  i'm not sure if this is intended behavior or a php bug  my assumption straight from the docs was  that i could pass a validated string to the datetime constructor 
when we install the bundles to create a basic symfony application into some subtree of project  the  symfony flex  https   github com symfony flex  copy create update files into project dir  files such as bundle php and configuration files  in case of a test application  the path is not the same of the compose json file  where they aways create update copy the files specified into the respective  recipes  https   github com symfony recipes  bundle 
config   and my bad   duplication only appears  if field has validation error

i don't know exactly  configuration of reader servise required on compile phase  i'm not shure about details of this process  i'll try to create same issue in doctrine annotations tracker on next week thank you
 painreign the  boot  method in your app's kernel  you can add the method in 
hi  xabbuh  i've tried to reproduce issue on small example  framework + templating + doctrine   the bug isn't reproduced  looks like some another third party bundle in my project failed while warmed and console command just silently stopped  i'm think this behavior was introduced with #25117  while i was trying play with composer dependencies broken lib was updated and fixed  and bug no more reproduced 
i am actually going to close this issue out  after doing some more digging  i realized that when i initially installed the security bundle  it was not installed using  composer req security  instead it was installed with the lexikjwt package  this did not fully implement all the necessary classes  resolved the issue by making sure to run  composer req security  and  composer require doctrine doctrine bundle  i can leave it open if it makes sense to understand why the packages did not play nicely with eachother
yes
hello  i also tried to reproduce my own problem without any success at first time  digging it deeper it might be a sign of some another bug  the error only happens in php7 1 with xdebug on  it's ok in php7 2 with or without xdebug and in php7 1 without xdebug  hope it helps 
it happens on a bigger closed source project  i am working on  i'm currently trying to figure out the cause by updating each package individually  i hope to be able to give more details soon 
thank you for your information     i removed a directory and installed packages again   rm  rf   vendor     composer install then i have just confirmed that it is normal
 xabbuh increasing execution time did not help 
yes  i will submit it today 👌 thanks 
consider a delete button which should do a delete request  you do post to   article 35  using a   form    perhaps even spoof the http method to delete using form component   yes  you could do a js asynchronous call  but i am talking "pure html" way of doing it  then  your form is pretty much
any solution to this problem 
 tobion first i wanted to dispatch a new message inside consumer  that became possible with the last update  dispatch_after_current_bus middleware   but i still have absolutely different middleware stack for sending and receiving messages  in case of one bus i have to use "if" in every middleware to check whether it is sending or receiving  imo it's better to put "ifs" into configuration of different buses 
this one  will resolve my problem  i do not know is the best solution   
never mind  somehow a  public folder was created within     pdutel src and in spite that mamp server was directed to     pdutel public it still threw the error 
please find it  at this repository    https   github com bernarda skeleton 
indeed  there is a deprecation warning when i use this private service  i was suprised to have an exception without compilerpass and no exception with it   this is definitely not a bug  thanks for your answer 
simply install skeleton  remove vendor packages  then replace composer and install again  clear cache  see error  have tested with https   symfony com doc current setup html and composer file provided in issue description error always for
here it is  created test project with simple form  that user bootstrap 4 horizontal form  https   github com chepainais sf4 bs4 file field did not used tested on earlier versions
since i don't use providers  i don't     but i'm  guessing  that they can't give you this information in real time  since they  probably  don't send the message synchronously  well  running your own smtp server is certainly the more professional way   so why not have some convenience methods  or bonus features  that only work with smtp 
i have    an  if  in my base template  to display the user a link to their "personal" page     a success message in the response generated by my  onlogoutsuccess     "you were logged out "    displaying such a message is the  core  functionality of a success handler  i would say  result  since the response is created when the token is still there  the final page says  can it be that this "bug" is the very reason why the  target   option was invented  https   symfony com doc 4 4 security html#logging out cause i can't see any benefit in redirecting the user  other than postponing the creation of the final response until the token is gone for sure  if i'm right about this  the  target   option could be dropped then  maybe the token could be passed as second  optional  argument to  onlogoutsuccess    in https   github com symfony symfony blob 4 4 src symfony component security http firewall logoutlistener php#l95   this would make everybody happy    
no  it does not  the two comment blocks need to be there 
i just commited everything on my repo https   github com lebadapetru learningsymfony   the form rendering takes place in templates setup_wizard html twig   the data is sent to the view through the setupwizardcontroller php where i'm using the form class setupwizardtype php to build the form 
i can give you the app  via email  no need to create a small applications because im working on big project which i need fast to finish  i'm frustrated because all the pages are in the same way coded  and only on this page is showing the bug  before in 4 0 i wasn't having similar problem  temporary solution for this problem  
no it doesn't work  quotes are not stripped from the value  the value is shown with quotes in php environment  and xdebug fails to process that  this value is read by  docker compose  and passed to the container with the following option   so i guess it's  docker compose  not stripping the quotes  
no i didn't change anything to vendor   i just deleted the directory and made a composer install to generate it again same result   yes i pasted it in plain text  here is a screenshoot and yes i get it on the exception page   no debug toolbar   no profiler  just the plain error page like on the screen and i get it for every type of exception   here is a cache problem  i was installing it   but i get it for 404 errors  routing problems etc  my problem is the exception message i s always about this  previous property of "error" i i really want to find the real problem  i need to check the hanfleexception line of the debug trace   in the screenshoot  i have a cacheexception for example   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3393980 41474950 b2010b7e 70bd 11e8 8e72 9b408f6d37d2 png 
yep i can give a try
 yceruto   unfortunately i don't have sufficient know how on how to implement this feature  or even if it is possible  so i've created this ticket to discuss this possibility 
have done  https   github com symfony validator pull 23
however  i think there is a problem  the command is only executed by the developer to have the info of his environment
i would  is preferred solution to skip authentication of already authenticated user 
actually   in https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge phpunit bootstrap php#l38 will only report environment variables from the shell at that moment  parameters from phpunit xml are probably not parsed yet  as far as i understand the code   and i might be completely off on this   the problem is  that in https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge phpunit deprecationerrorhandler php#l104 the mode parameter is reset to 0 because of https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge phpunit deprecationerrorhandler php#l57 not recognizing "disabled" as a valid value for mode  trying to parse an integer  fails and falls back to 0  in consequence mode will never be set to "disabled" in https   github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge phpunit deprecationerrorhandler php#l105 
yes is same sorry 
thank you  sorry don't answer before  it's work well know for me
of course   https   gist github com pou4ever c90e4387d024cc07e3405602868ed744
 xabbuh sure  i thought the bundle is handled as a symfony component  i have re submitted the bug to https   github com symfony webpack encore bundle issues 31
hum  i did not   in my config folder i have a bunch of  maybe i'm wrong but it seems to be related to this   bug #29461  contracts  extract localeawareinterface out of translatorinterface   nicolas grekas  
hi nicolas  confirmed 3 4 dev fixes the problem
i thought the same  i don't know what was the exact problem  but i have updated composer from 1 7 2 to 1 8 6 and the problem is gone  no errors now 
will do   
 xabbuh done  while creating it  i discovered a connection with a custom twig extension in which the same non shared service is injected  if you remove the 'prismicextension'  the test environment shows no error  the application is set to 'test' in  env  change it to 'dev' to see a working one   29628 zip  https   github com symfony symfony files 2694843 29628 zip 
hi  i'm sorry for being late  i made an example application that has an same error  you can checkout it here  https   github com xaro93 forum
yeah  i'm embarrassed  of course it's about the php version  to someone else who could fool himself with such issue  i was using docker and i was using the php  fpm  7 3 dev image  which was not updated for some time  once i've upgraded to the latest stable 7 3 2 version  everything is working as expected 
 nicolas grekas yes  it works also  i work in docker on windows   if it matters
hi  sorry for the delay when responding  this is the field 
yup  i realized it was exactly that  when everything started working after deleting another voter which tutor used just to explain something  it was a file with function but   no return in it    surprisingly in his case  symphony 4 0 4  there was no problem 
this is a sonata admin class  which is rendering the form  protected function configureformfields formmapper  formmapper     formmapper   add 'name'  null  array 'required'    false     add 'binarycontent'  filetype  class  array 'required'    false       hope this can help you 
 nicolas grekas i will try 
no  i don't know if this is an issue or an assumption when programming  the problem is that  templateemail  generates the text of the message when the object is forwarded to  mailerinterface  send  where then  bodyrendererinterface  is launched based on the  messageevent  event  the problem with signing such a message is that the method does not return the class that entered the method  smimesigner  sign  but we only get an instance of  message  that is not parsed by  bodyrendererinterface   and all  context  and  htmltemplate  are dropped  so signing a message in this case has the wrong path  because just after signing and sending  a message with empty content goes to the given e mail account 
no  it seems like both environmets have this behavior  i logged this data  2019 05 14 11 58 dev 122 ms  2019 05 14 12 12 dev 1140 ms  2019 05 14 12 17 dev 119 ms  2019 05 14 12 36 dev 4091 ms  2019 05 14 12 36 dev 161 ms  2019 05 14 12 36 dev 125 ms  2019 05 14 12 37 prod 83 ms  2019 05 14 12 38 prod 77 ms  2019 05 14 12 41 prod 80 ms  2019 05 14 12 42 prod 77 ms  2019 05 14 12 44 prod 81 ms  2019 05 14 12 55 prod 78 ms  2019 05 14 01 08 prod 3431 ms  2019 05 14 01 09 prod 70 ms  2019 05 14 01 17 prod 3560 ms  2019 05 14 01 19 prod 79 ms  2019 05 14 01 28 prod 77 ms  2019 05 14 01 30 prod 82 ms  2019 05 14 01 38 prod 3216 ms  you can see  that cache updated only after 7 8 minute idle 
here is doctrine mapping 
i had some problems at work  so i didn't work on in  go ahead  and thank you 
 dmaicher pointed out the right solution for me  i imagined that a simple approach should have been enough  but i didn't find that page in the docs  informations provided by  cfoehrdes are also useful and i'm sure that in the future i'll make good use of them  so really thank you 
 xabbuh sure  i'll create a small application and i'll upload it here at github 
my password was null in the database  so the  password variable was null on line 48 of userpasswordencoder file  my bad   i'm sorry

namespaced attributes are very useful _but  imo  a bad code smell_  so long as we get input from the wider symfony community  so this is a bottom up and evidenced decision  and not imposed from the top  i support deprecating them 
hey  linaori thanks for a quick response  it is really appreciable    below is my constraint detail     constraint   new regex  'pattern'    '       8          d       a z        a z        a z          #       _+  '  '             s     '     let me tell you that this regex works perfectly when i tried to test it with  preg_match  directly 
had to apply this fix to make the specific commit work https   github com symfony symfony commit b0925025f8dce5a4b38f9403976c1c6180cf69ff here are the profiles  before  https   blackfire io profiles 232b3e72 f8cf 4438 b8b7 798bc6004e83 graph after  https   blackfire io profiles 8c90e987 3e20 4762 9f6d ed9f4ac2b959 graph with fix  https   blackfire io profiles 3c0b255e 7bdd 499b 8013 e99f46751592 graph the fix seems to improve the situation but still much time is spent in the setdefinitions method  shouldn't the lazy message callback be called only when the error is to be displayed  looking at the profile it doesn't seem so  let me know if there's anything else i can do
 xabbuh here it is  https   github com o alquimista symfony test i grabbed the latest symfony demo and applied the necessary changes to   src entity post  and   src controller admin blogcontroller php   at the new   method 
 xabbuh i'm just using    php bin console server run   which usually does not trigger symfony when requesting an existing file  like styles css or images  located in  public    calling controller actions works like charm  just requesting sym linked assets  does not work  copied assets work 
 nicolas grekas thanks for short response time  symfony support rocks  not working for me   profiler shows content length to be empty string   by the way  i observed probably unrelated behavior   when trying to access   response  getinfo 'debug'   of the curlhttpclient  i got   uncaught typeerror  argument 1 passed to symfony component mime encoder eightbitcontentencoder  encodestring   must be of the type string  resource given  called in  vendor symfony mime part textpart php on line 120 and defined in  vendor symfony mime encoder eightbitcontentencoder php 31  while accessing debug info of nativehttpclient was just fine 
 nicolas grekas it doesn't help  it just creates connection with incorrect parameter  edit  sorry  it works  i stupidly let there     instead of     if this is expected behavior it can be closed  but  redis   localhost 6379 dbindex 5  works with revisions made for symfony 4 
yes and these didn't change
apparently there used to be an  abstract class  or just a  class   then the situation changed and the  interface  appeared  it became necessary to implement   session  at user class  but it needs to be checked on several versions of  symfony   in my opinion  a strange mechanism has been preserved in the new distribution   artifact     try to search by vendor  there in many places  getsession    is used  this raises the relevance of this method to version  4 3   but in the documentation   this  session  set         as far as i remember  this code was automatically generated with  getsession      authenticator   thank you for understanding 
ok  will provide this tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
thank you for your response  i'll give it a try  the action called is called  undolostandfoundaction  with a capital 'f'  while the to call action given in the routing is  undolostandfound  with a small letter 'f'  the routing component manages to translate  undolostandfound  to the  undolostandfoundaction  action  however it does not inject the translatorinterface  translator 
it's one app  but it is running on several ec2 instances  yes  it is a similar request  but a little different 
yes  problem fixed 
 lyrixx thanks for triggering me on that  i didn't notice that my proxy configuration already set the x_forwarded_proto  it was just a case of trusting the internal proxy and it worked  d 👍
yes  we could save the time when the last email was sent with the transport and then compare this with the current time before a new email is sent  only if the difference is above a threshold  the server will be pinged  however  i think 10 seconds is still way too low  the default timeout is 5 minutes according to  rfc5321  https   tools ietf org html rfc5321#section 4 5 3 2   with a threshold of only 10 seconds  it is much more likely that the connection will still be dropped due to too many noop commands than an actual timeout   xabbuh this is a bug  not a feature 
thanks for your quick reply  i'd "simply" extend the workflow yml configuration as follows   of course  the fallback would be to not pass an object but a string     no translation in this case   what do you think

 xabbuh i've checked  yes  you're right  i use  tetraweb php  docker image  that's why my php version was 7 1 maximum  that explains the error message i get   nicolas grekas i agree  thank you all for participation  i appreciate your time 
ah  i have been trying to update to 4 4  and come to conclusion it is working yet then i downgrade to 4 3 so the config is not removed on downgrade   which is right 
here is the example
 xabbuh of course  if it helps however do you really need it  if we take a look at composer json at amazonsqstransport repository   it requires symfony messenger    5 0   and http client   5 0    see https   github com symfony amazon sqs messenger blob master composer json   but other transports require symfony messenger    5 1    see  https   github com symfony doctrine messenger blob master composer json https   github com symfony amqp messenger blob master composer json probably there's a problem

sorry i just saw that it's the same issue than   #35916 i rolled back to v4 4 4 for now waiting the fix for the next release 
thanks  lyrixx i would love to submit a pr  do you have any suggestions on how i would approach this  do you have a preference on whether the optional config item should be a  "which events should be fired"  or a "which events shouldn't be fired"  my current thinking is to add a new method into  workflow php  called  shoulddispatchevent    which will be called within each event function such as  completed    and  announce    where the eventdispatcher is checked    shoulddispatchevent    will be hooked up to the config item mentioned in the original comment  events  thoughts

maybe the best is to automatically replace  0  with  null   this will avoid the comparison all together  example using  null  instead  http   jsfiddle net bjhgm 1

thank you for your fast reply  i see that it works in the jsfiddle  now  i think it has someting to to with series that are dynamicly added after chart creation    or we did something wrong   i will try to make a demo  but this could take until next week in cause of holidays

i want to set tooltip disabled by returning null or empty string  if i return empty string  empty long tooltip is displayed  if i return null  tooltip is displayed with the original formatter  thanks  jungwon
oh  just updated it and it is now fix  i'm sorry about that  thank you  
oh i'm sorry  we do not use the chart in that way  while simplifying my example i removed too much  here's a better example  http   jsfiddle net jvisser vnpwb 4 
your examples worked correctly  i was unable to give you access to our stuff as it is subscription based  i have found that the problem was being cause by fastclick  https   github com ftlabs fastclick   i removed the fastclick library and the high stock chart legend started working correctly  for now i will leave the fastclick library out of our project 
hye torstein  yes that's it     in the left tree menu     and yes you did it  no more double  it is always a pleasure to help you increase highsoft quality      soon  i will donate for highstock chart using in our nex website  not yet deployed  
having a comment at the top of the file with the settings used to create that file would go a long way  but ideally there'd be a way to have a config file locally that could be modified  a json file  text file  etc  and then a command to build just those modules  on the command line  similar to the  custom build example  https   github com jquery jquery#custom build examples  section in the jquery docs  grunt is useful for this  but there are other ways   as for the actual download page    for example i generated one with pieseries checked but then got "highcharts error #17" as if pie's weren't in my file  full version works fine   then i tried to rebuild it and got 0k    screenshot 2014 04 23 09 24 14  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 97612 2780170 fcc728fa cb03 11e3 80bc 14c3a9362461 png 
agree  i was just confused by this example http   jsfiddle net xjgry 13  but now i see the difference  and  this markergroup element  works as i wanted  thanks 
hi  the workaround got me past the problem so many thanks for the quick reply  g 
yes and no  it's online but it's behind a login screen  i will try to make a minimal jsfiddle during the day 
try 450 in your example 
yes  right you are  it was problem in my second chart  when i've tried to add series with yaxis option to second chart  it was mistake  because i don't have any axis in second chart  i thought that it was problem with the first one  i've broken my brain to know what's the problem  but it was obviously  thank you for the reply

i figured it out  it looks like i have to set  is there any better documentation on these variables somewhere 
 sebastianbochan that does seem to have worked  i haven't had a chance yet to watch the android device logcat as the code is executing in the webview  which is how i knew for certain that the  onload  handler wasn't being called  but i'm fairly sure that it's doing as it should now  so  in your own tests on android 4 1 x  with no  externalresourcesrequired  parameter you see the same issue i was seeing  i e   onload  not firing  but in android 7 x it is firing  and with  externalresourcesrequired  set to  true  it works on both  if so  i'm satisfied that it's the same issue and that your solution fixes it  furthermore  it seems to me  from playing with this in chrome desktop and looking at the network tab  that setting  externalresourcesrequired  to  true  does not have an effect on caching    i was worried that it might force the external resources to be fetched again each time  even if cached locally  that doesn't seem to be the case    let me know if you know otherwise  i love it when the solution is straightforward    btw are you testing this in an emulator  browserstack  it would be handy to know  and be able to roadtest this stuff quickly on various versions of android  i find the emulators in android studio to be a complete pita to use    would be far nicer to test somewhere else  especially considering what i'm doing is basically just running stuff in a webview

you are right  paweł  my bad   
sure  you can see a live demo of the bug at http   jsfiddle net jgerigmeyer h705n915   i'm not sure if it only happens when you have two linked  category  axes  but that seemed to be the easiest way to demonstrate it 
i've updated the fiddle to demonstrate the issue  http   jsfiddle net 6tp1dlof 
 pawelfus http   jsfiddle net sz0esszz 
thanks  that works for my case  but does't for this  http   stackoverflow com questions 24960423 high charts xaxis label cannot be display after reset zoom
 highslide software not reliable  the animation length varies depending on the data in the chart  which isn't static   sometimes you get flick  either because the duration is too short or too long technically speaking its also a wordaround hack  there should be a callback which executes when the animation finishes  and this is possible from higcharts end since it does use jquery mootools for animations 
already did  no changes 
try zoom in the examples that i shared  you will be able to reproduce the issue 
example  http   jsfiddle net bate o80z3qfc 2
here's a live example  https   speedcurve com demo responsive  s 299 u 907 r eu west 1 d 30 m speedindex share 39tfnozeq94p1o0hndk1kpbg4vb7cg in the top chart toggle the apple ipad series on off via the legend and you'll see that a couple of points in the firefox series animates up and down 
update  torsteinhonsi  oysteinmoseng i have updated jsfiddle  so now one of charts shows "no data to display" after i zoom in using setextremes function  please find  updated jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net 0gr20drc 3   i believe it is a bug and chart should not show "no data to display" if the data was zoomed out  because it has data to display  but it is currently invisible 
 billystalnaker i agree  but then the error should be more elaborate  otherwise it is not clear where and what to fix in project 
that has worked  thank you very much 
ok  i didn't know why i have poor performance on hide all and show all   implement like this for hide all for example   setvisible false  false     for each series chart redraw   can you help me  i have 20 series   in the past versions i didn't have that problem  i also used boost js and it didn't help  2017 06 26 14 49 gmt+03 00 torstein hønsi  notifications github com

thx for the fast answer  it's working but label formatter overrides default lang numericsymbols  i've made nasty workaround for this to prevent showing huge numbers  and also added formatting for first element    is there any option to preserve default numeric symbols in this case  thanks
i am testing on ipad air 5
 oysteinmoseng thanks for the clarification    sorry for the misunderstanding
ah interesting  my use case is in my react library that wraps highcharts  a highcharts chart in my library would look something like this  basically all the components inside   highchartschart   watch for their props to change   if a change occurs  they call something context appropriate like  this axis settitle 'new title'  false   my use case is  that to prevent an excessive amount of redraws  i call  a debounced redraw function  https   github com whawker react jsx highcharts blob master packages react jsx highcharts src components basechart basechart js#l105 l109  that tries to limit the number of redraws
no it's not the same id but i can add the divid in the containersrngpsd pretty easily because the div id is the _id in the collection of the container      collection infocontainers       idcontainer  comes from docker   _id  is added automatically by mongo and is the same as the div id
sorry  i tried to reproduce it in  ionic lab  but its not happening   the chartoptions displays as expected 
 sebastianbochan steps are as follows using fiddle http   jsfiddle net qk4rfbot 1   1  hover on the border joining the two slices  green and blue one  2  do not move mouse now you should see the blue slice moving in and out even though the mouse is not moved   which is not expected   please let me know in case your not able to reproduce it  may be i can take a video and share
i guess the operator precedence works  my bad  i do notice that the 1st point in the hidden series is available to the keyboard navigation when using skipkeyboardnavigation  see http   jsfiddle net primerano x0d7325h 1  click "hide series"  shift tab to the chart  space to enter chart and then start tabbing  1st point selected is in the hidden series  also  at the end it tabs through the hidden "series 1" legend item  i see you already made a commit to allow skipping of hidden series  how can i test that code out  thanks tony

it is tough to make a fully reproducible sample since the problem occurs intermittently  however here are all the chart options we use 
thanks for workaround  i will try if new version doesnt fix it  
 pawelfus yes that looks like the issue to this fix i saw  but as described it fixes just the default behaviour  if i force the usage of a comma it is still broken  i modified the example of your linked issue to demonstrate the problem  http   jsfiddle net 3hgd5hu2 1  quotes has to be added to those columns  for example like this https   github com simonberger export csv commit 8a21717229566a2f42846a3424b9ed527d76d871
thanks  it works fine now 
hi  yes  i am sure that i am using settings i've sent   the navigator that you can see is separate chart  with it's height set to 0  so only navigator is visible  it is not using boost module  so it's not important here   i can reproduce this issue even with navigator removed  i am having troubles reproducing it in fiddler  but still not giving up    i can't reproduce the case in gif that happened when i zoomed out   i will cut this part out 
 sebastianbochan the data is the same on some dates  is there any way to set one of the two broken lines off a bit  overlapping lines are not a good plan
on my mac i have chrome "69 0 3497 81  official build   64 bit " and its works fine with highcharts  but our customers have different windows server 2008 and all use chrome 68 0 3440  i tried also to re install chrome on windows server but the version that google gave me is always the same  68 0 3440   how do i install the chrome ver 69 
thanks for your response  yes  i should probably not have stated "all"  since i don't know exactly what is supposed to be private and what not  i just assumed my request applies to many of those members  since it applied to the ones i needed  you are the ones who knows best  nevertheless  i already would expect the official docs to contain all the publicly intended members and methods  including at least the ones you listed   since this is a commercial product  i can understand if everything is not typed yet  since your official statement is still that ts is in beta currently 
we have requirements to have fixed height and width of a single element and align the chart on the bottom left corner in our case we potentialy have max 50 rows  and if there are less than we calculate margin  the chart is drawn correctly  but print is failed in case we have 1 to 5 rows 
hi  sebastianbochan  thank you for the reply  my device is samsung galaxy s7 with android 6 0 i also tested it on iphone x and galaxy s9 using  browserstack  https   www browserstack com   regarding ios   i could reproduce it by double tapping on the chart 
 kacpermadej you make a valid point  i wasn't comparing apples to applies  i modified my example and found that when navigator is set to select full range  disabling datagrouping on the main chart has approximately the same impact as disabling datagrouping on the navigator  https   jsfiddle net 36sk9uy1   see console output  the reason i didn't notice that disabling datagrouping had the same performance impact on a main chart as on the navigator was that when i applied it to main charts  i was able to compensate for the performance hit by turning on the boost module  i have several charts with no navigator  the same height and width as a navigator  showing the full range of their data  10k data points   with datagrouping disabled  and boost module on  for clarity  i'm making an ecg viewer with   large chart  no navigator  range of 10 seconds of heartbeat visible  scrollbar for scrolling through 1 minute   zoomed out view of heartbeat  range  2min to  1min  datagrouping disabled  boost on   zoomed out view   1min to 0min  datagrouping disabled  boost on   hidden chart with navigator showing 0min to 1min with selected range of 10s  and event handling to update large chart with range selected here   zoomed out view  +1min to +2min  datagrouping disabled  boost on   zoomed out view  +2min to +3min  datagrouping disabled  boost on  however the boost module seems to have no effect in speeding up rendering of just the navigator  perhaps that's really the issue for me   boost has no noticeable effect at improving rendering of navigator after datagrouping is disabled 
 bre1470   do you have more information on the custom properties   documentation or something    we may be consuming things wrong on our side 
hi  here in your example you have given null values to march and april month so when i hover on the chart for these particular month i should not see any of the tooltip but right now when i hover over the these months i am seeing the tooltip of previous active or next active month which has values in it  this behaviour i want to avoid  i guess you got my point  thanks and regards  deepak tondle on wed  may 8  2019 at 2 57 pm sebastian  notifications github com  wrote     thanks and regards   deepak prakash tondle   consultant  ui developer    saama technologies   pune  india   9096458345   image  signature image        this communication is confidential and subject to and governed by saama’s electronic communications disclaimer   https   www saama com email communication disclaimer

chart reflow   wont fix it but chart showdrillupbutton   worked as a temporary fix for me as it renders button again

hi graeme  i managed to add some more logging settings and set level to finest  jboss conf logging properties  find attached logs  let me know how else i can help
we can  we used different name already with transient setter getter for back compatibility   which works fine  i created this issue  because this was allowed in previous grails  2 4 2   maybe this should be stated in upgrade guide  also error message in test is not clear  let me know if i can help further or just close it  thanks
jeff i confirm it in my message  new project with tag library working as expecting  in which object and fields i can find something detail about problem  i upgrade my project from 1 1 to 3 2 incrementally all this time  maybe i have some old code  last error gsp from 3 2 give me
 jeffbrown i am busy this week  but i will create a demo app next week
i come from a lamp stack background and am fairly new to groovy  grails  servlets  weblogic so i apologize if i am misinformed here or don't totally understand what is going on  i am having difficulty finding the stack trace  i can't seem to find any stacktrace log or see any in the stdout   like i do with jboss or tomcat when there is an error    the only information i can find is the server logs for the deployment   and in the access logs i see a report of a 403 error without any more information  i am thinking that this 403 is returned by the server   and not the applciation   because the servlet is not initializing and the server thinks that i am trying to browse the file structure  if i change the settings to allow browsing the file structure i no longer get a 403 and instead see all the files from the war  at this point i'd cry if i saw any sign of life from this application even if it were just a stack trace from an error  i have successfully deployed an example war provided by oracle that i can visit and use in my browser on this server but it seems to be built using an earlier servlet specification and includes a web xml file  i have also created two other blank grails apps using 3 0 14 as well as 3 1 1 and both of them behave the same as my current app  they deploy and have a status of active but when i visit the url i get a 403  i will keep researching and trying to find a stack trace but any assistance with debugging techniques would be greatly appreciated  i truly appreciate your time and effort in helping me look into this 
it doesn't 
i found a weird thing  if the controller looks like this   class helpcontroller   def displayhelp      name 'hello'        then http   localhost 8080 help displayhelp works  however  if the controller looks like this   class helpcontroller   def displayhelp        nothing return       or the controller looks like this   class helpcontroller   def displayhelp     log debug "hi everybody"         then the error will happen i tested it in development mode in intellij 15  in windows 10 x64
yes  as the grails 3 1 works  this is my  build gradle  file 
i have upgraded the gorm  grails  hibernate version  so this issue is no longer exists  upgraded versions are as follows gorm  6 1 4 grails  3 2 10 hibernate5 6 1 4
 jeffbrown you might try creating an empty project with grails 3 3 1 and then try running it with grails 3 3 2  if that doesn't work then try building the same project with the latest version of gradle  4 4 1  and see if that does the trick  if neither of those approaches work  let me know and i'll strip down this project and see if i can create something that reproduces this  seeing as the error has been reported previously though  there should be some way of reproducing it  regards  mark
 ilopmar sure  this is simplified illustration of my situation  myorg customer companycontroller  that solution works perfectly on 2 x  but after upgrading to 3 x all requests to " v1 managers     companies" forwarded to customer controller  because in both cases namespace truncated to  v1    i was bypass it by replacing all     to  _   but for figure out what is going wrong i spent 2 days  and i don't want that somebody will fall into the same trap 
yes  the same thing happens  the id must exist and its value must not be null for it to work  if the object is embedded   proof of this is that the main object that contains the embedded "ruta" has a null id and it manages to reach the rest endpoint

bc   defining basic_evalf in evalf py avoids circular imports  and i dislike the option of importing the evalf module from inside a method in basic py  some of the layout is not final  for example the code for integrals should probably move to sympy integrals  but until it's more mature  i feel it's more maintainable to have it all in one place  same for basic_evalf   p  original comment  "http   code google com p sympy issues detail id 977#c2" http   code google com p sympy issues detail id 977#c2 p  original author  "https   code google com u 111502149103757882156 " https   code google com u 111502149103757882156

 m  and  n  are non negative integers  should i have made that more explicit they were declared to be such when i ran the computation it's a finite sum  if a convergence condition is returned then something has gone wrong the second sum is   x + y   n   but it is expressed in the form   1 + t   n  if meijer g is causing problems then should the code be changed so that gosper is tried first

thanks for checking this submission  i verified i could copy source code from the preview version into a source file and execute it correctly  apparently you retrieved the source code by getting into edit mode in my original entry  thanks for the backticks suggestion  i've now edited my original version as suggested   the λ didn't get copied into my windows source file  but the program ran anyway    i'm in a steep learning curve at the moment  
same result  though i don't really think that should be a problem  since x could certainly be imaginary in that case 
the current testing framework is only _mildly_ compatible  the other option would be to make it fully compatible but i'm not sure what kind of task that is  i suspect you prefer that option over adding features to the current testing framework though 
in sage  you can create a  polynomialring  object and use the corresponding variables to build matrices  both implicilly as well as explicitly by specifying the base ring  
i agree  i'm actually super perturbed when a lambdified expression results in a sympy expression  rather than some numeric answer  if  sympy  was removed from the defaults this wouldn't happen  it would be a breaking change  but i doubt anyone uses lambdify to manipulate expressions   both it's docstring and the prose docs discuss only numeric cababilities   asmeurer   what are your thoughts on this  if this turns into a lengthy discussion  i'll revert my change in the pr and add this later  perhaps that would be best anyway  this does make the deprecation  slightly  easier to deal with though  so i'd prefer this solution 
that's a nice thing to think about  i'll read about it and post my thoughts here  if i'll have something productive 
your patch passed the travis build  are we supposed to close the issue only after the patch gets merged 
x   symbol 'x' 
 gschintgen   it is unexpected  because  2  oo  gives  oo  instead of  2  oo   moreover   2  oo   3  oo  gives  nan   but  2  oo   pi  oo  gives  oo  and this is indeed incorrect

my mistake  i assumed sympy gamma had the latest installation of sympy  turns out it's using a version from april of last year  http   gamma sympy org input  i solve 281e 32 x 29
true  but still 
cython 0 22 and sympy 0 7 6  both installed using pip with the   user option  os is bullx 6 2  i will try it at home later as well later tonight edit  i should add that theano_function also works  there is no particular reason why i want to use cython but i just saw it during testing 
this is embarrassing  i should have investigated more  this is not just happening with sympy  but with any matplotlib plot  i note that if i start the repl with 'ipython   gui qt' everything runs great  i've changed my profile to set  i apologize for wasting people's time  i should have been able to figure this out myself  or at least not have blamed it on sympy 
when i print  sympy __version__   i get 1 0 as output 
i had to add a a term to my u_ind  since i couldn't generate a list of velocity constraints without a coordinate 1st derivative  this was the obvious thing to do in retrospect  and so the failure to run the linearisation is a good sanity check  i'm closing the issue  thanks 
mine veersion of sympy is "0 7 7 dev"  with python2 7 6  giving different error when using the installed sympy   the error above mentioned is the one i got when used the cloned sympy  and this is the error when i used the sympy i installed via  sudo apt get  
 d thx  posting here for the record 
yep  can't replicate in dev   i was using the latest version via  pip install ing  will close  sorry thanks 
 first had to edit the original post  in its simplest form   gives  arg exp i w    but just  w  should do it   
i would think it should be something like this  it can be hard to read if you have huge expressions and tiny brackets  i feel like the brackets should be the same height as the expressions  it looks better than the one with tiny brackets 
that already works and and has nothing to do with sympy  or i fail to see what the connection should be  as it only uses plain python  it yields      which is the same result as for   1 2 3  0   because that’s how the multiplication of iterables and integers works in python  
what i put in  i e    x  oo  simplify    x  oo   i can still substitute  x  with a non negative value other than one  so it’s not clear that the result is  nan   right now we have 
 arifahmed1995 does fixing it in mpmath fixes it in sympy 
 arighnaiitg the file would be  sympy physics quantum tensorproduct py   in which you can see that  tensor_product_simp  acts differently depending on the argument  just as there is a  tensor_product_simp_mul  when the argument is  mul   i would write a  tensor_product_simp_pow  when the argument is  pow   replacing the line that is already there for  pow    this function should simply take the exponent that is over the tensor product and apply that to each argument in the tensor product  that is  in some form of pseudo expression 
i think one would expect the output to be similar to the following  except for the expression returned by cse being a matrix where the individual elements are terms as defined by matrix multiplication  that is  unchanged by  cse     
 satyaprakashdwibedi yes  both of the two math expressions that you gave should be 1s   vedarth n  2 is incorrect  'e' is an identity matrix  the total sum should be the same as the number of diagonal elements  which is 'n' 
gladly  with the caveat that i'm quite new to programming in general and sympy python specifically  so i might have no idea what i'm doing  with  matrix  
for me  using  pypy  instead of python fixed it 
indeed  it works correctly in 1 1 2 dev  closing the issue 
no  don't put try except block  this needs further investigation  why does the test want a finitefield of nonprime order  what does it expect to do with it 
yes  you can 
indeed  i tested in the branch of #14158 and got correct result  false  instead of the this error 
no idea for now  i have not dug into it 
returns  installed using macports 
basically  yes  but not necessarily  imagine i have a set of some elements that cannot be expressed one by means of others  atm  i can't invent any concrete example when they do not form some vector space   then  i want to know if some other formal combinations of elements can be represented via this set  that is  actually  representation in a basis   now  solvers make a logical assumption that  a  and  b  can be in some way connected  e g   a  b tau0   for "linearly independent" elements this is  by definition  impossible  i see two possibilities here  1  an assumption  say   lindep false  that prohibits non additive combinations  a b  a b  a  b etc  with other linearly independent symbols — which doesn't seem to have many applications in general 2  some general function that  given an arbitrary basis and an element  represents a function in that basis — if i'm correct  something similar is implemented in quantum and polynomial modules 
i wrote a convenience wrapper for sympify for the users of my library that accepts something like  'a i '   here is the shortened code 
i can't see an automatic way to handle ambiguity  but could suggest either that an option is provided to parse_latex  to switch on off the implicit multiplication  or that a list of 'reserved' words is provided to parse_latex as an optional argument  such that this list of words are not expanded as part of the implicit multiplication  a combination of both of these strategies would hopefully catch all circumstances 
yes  that is working  in this case  i'll just change the test which i mentioned above 
they form the domain set of distribution and used to derive expectation  variance  ie use for integration or summation    oscarbenjamin do you it would be good idea to look into it 
don't know  i have added  pycosat  in the dependency matrix for  asv  but still it failed 
easy  just fire up python3 7 and type 
it's 1 5 release version  and same issue happens in latest development version as well 
it originally failed on the travis in my pr  without any obvious correlation  i tried it out on master and it failed  https   travis ci org github sympy sympy jobs 678494834 i got a maxrecursiondepthexceeded error locally lemme check now 
here is the resulting code from the 3dsmax export  http   pastebin com 7caqekgu
yes  sure   http   www axelmoussard fr opendata demo html it's a first prototype for a future website  thanks for the help   
yes  zoom in combinedcamera works fine and is controlled using links  possibly i could assign the same behaviour to mouse wheel 
thanks for that  i will get onto it and send a pr when done 
i have an ati with asus eah4350 chipset  running on xp  cheap but works great with games like hl2 at full specs  and all the testing is done in the latest chrome dev i rarely user firefox now  but i've just seen that on the latest ff4 0b7  the lights_pointlights_gl demo works fine  on the other side  the spheres i was moving around with fox and textures  on ff they are completely black  can see them because the backgound is dark blue  you can take a look here  if you wish  http   www omiod com test game fk2 htm i used webglrenderer2_sandbox html as starting path  and now i see that it is very choppy and lacks textures in ff  while in chrome it is nice and smooth 
i mean i couldn't modify it right because i don't know the right way i have a plane in my scene and i want when i click in a point on the plane at that position to create an object  let's say a box  and then i want to be able when i click at the box to select it the dimensions of the renderer that i use is 1300 x 700  it's not window innerwidth   window innerheight  can you please point me how this can be done 
ok it is a front camera and i want to make it a perspective camera how will i rotate the x vector of the camera 
i can try to update it  i'm happy to take your suggestions patches  some comments before you do the only reason people should arrive at that page is because webgl is not running for them  so there is not much reason to put a fancy demo  there are versions with a spinning webgl logo instead of the green square but another issue is keeping it small because again  basically only people that can not see webgl will arrive there so for example at first someone sent in a 4meg demo with a spinning webgl logo  then another that came in at 400k  currently it's just planned to have a spinning cube with a webgl texture on it  keeping it fast and simple so the user can get back to whatever they really wanted to do in the first place  so      it mostly needs better page design  less 3d  as for the troubleshooting page maybe i should just make it redirect to the link it provides rather than display it  thoughts 
that a cool option too but there's still the question of why  always  attach to  window  if you attach to  scope domelement  instead then users can work around the rest and it  seems  like you get the same behavior as your currently getting but still let users work around the issues
hi chandler  i realized the flaw of my method  it is a recursive pipeline where lod chunks are organized in a quadtree and selected based on view distance  by managing the  visible  attribute  it also meant making sure everything starts at invisible and only the relevant chunks are marked to rendering  this first step  to mark everything as invisible  meant traversing the entire quadtree to reset the attributes  i've hacked my way into the immediate rendering pass  so each object is rendered as needed without the need to maintain these flags  providing the speed boost i was looking for  do you perform any sort of out of core rendering for your terrain engine  where you only maintain a subset of your tiles on the gpu 
i've sorted that out  thank you    it’s just boxcollider  “mesh” property is added dynamically in another place and initially is not a member of boxcollider object 
thanks  hayfield  subdividing the plane solved this  and  was far less expensive than my earlier attempts to make 400 little plane tiles   mrdoob  it would be great to be able to put a value of something  like zorder  that when set will always be drawn before or after something else  for instance  if i set something like  this board zorder   1  this cursor zorder   2  then  regardless it will draw all of the zorder number 1 items first  then all of the number 2 items  etc    forcing the board to be below any content  again  thanks for this  hopefully  i'll have something worthy of showing off in a couple of months 
yes  i set tried to set this in constructor  set this dynamically    one result   nothing 
well  i found my way out of it  i didn't know that when you create a face the given arguments are the number of the vertex  i was giving the vertex itself as the argument  and that was creating the error  thanks for answering so fast  i am eager to learn three and collaborate with you  misandov
i use the webglrenderer 
oh  thanks for pointing that out  chandlerprall  would the appropriate solution to just have a parameter you can pass  e g   this domelement   parameters element    document  or is there a better solution

hi mr doob  sorry for late reply  but i had to step off threejs for a bit  yes  you are correct in most circumstances for objects in 3d space  but i am simply rendering walls  so it is assumed that all the walls are perpendicular to the ground  so  they can be represented as lines in this context  with their surface parallel to the "floor"  each floor has a fixed height applied to all walls  each wall then is to be displayed as a plane  this is not ideal in the long run  but it is currently the way we are mapping information from 2d cad  our current java opengl software already displays like this and i was hoping to do a simple mapping to webgl  we got an example up and running using triangle polygons in webgl  but there were issues with the normals and then when we tried to incorporate fonts into the rendering  we realised we needed more powerful libraries and threejs looks like the best bet out there at the moment  with a good collection of nice examples  ideally  we would like to be rendering 3d building information models  bim  in webgl  with import functionality for tools like google sketchup  that way we can use surface models for certain types of views  but also have a more hardy underlying solid model like ifc to incorporate more domain specific data about a building for things like simulation  so  this is where we are starting    and all help is very very much appreciated  kris 
hi mrdoob  this works better  but i think this is still not a orthographic projection same as general opengl theory  for following code it works   the fifth parameter still have a range requirement  if i change it to  1  it will not display  also  the z position of the camera affects the result if i change to 10000  it will not display   in theory  the z position of camera will not affect the result of orthographic projection   by the way  i am a fresh man of 3d graphics  i am not sure about this  you can try to update these parameters to analyze whether it is a bug or my understanding issue  this is not so urgent for me since i am just learning threejs  i can skip it to continue  and maybe orthographic projection is really not so generally used  but if you have time  you can try to look into it to see whether it is a issue to make threejs more perfect  sorry for my poor english  thanks  shenghong
i did not say all encoders      lol i actually thought the opposite  a clean interface to create their pages three js 3dweb  an interface for setting the scene  environmental  camera  lighting       subject  import  position  scale  materials        interactions  what the visitor can do   rendering  size  quality       aims to allow non advanced users coders or designers  for example  to create 3d pages more easily      without having to go into the code      the gain can become very interesting for companies  a site it takes several photos  professional        to show a product  the 3d will replace it with the created 3d development  car  furniture  digital cameras  etc      more computing time to buy since the calculation is made at the request of the client on his machine     but the online should be accessible to as many or the need for an interface     blender is good but not friendly public and very and very far from the 3d software used in the industry     it is to make films  the industry interested in using software 3dweb surface or volume modeling  rhino  autocad  alias  solidworks  catia  etc     and most can export in many formats     i'm french and google is my badfriend
hi mrdoob  can i zip its' contents and send it in an email  i won't be able to make the link public because its' on an internal server  and currently i'm just working of my desktop 
thank both of you very much for the quick reply  i really appreciate your awesome work   zz85  just regarding your code your answer seems very logical      i created a very short example to test it but it fails   so getpoint   works and the gettangent   method exists but runs into an error  i was using _r45_  do i need a more recent version of three js  if there is one  or will the code need to be fixed      kind regards and thank you again 
thanks very much   sorry  i do not know how to link with the my page    i will see whether i can send the folder     
i gave it a shot  the newer dev version has the same issue as the one i was previously using 
humm    i don't know if i can do that  it's a building's final modeling    i will ask the permission to the liable company     but  seeing the code  i think the shader var isn't mandatory  right  what i did here  for testing  was just add an if to the code on line 621  as below   the load code run with no errors  i'll try to render now  to see if will work 
well  i have simplified the model because our customer doesn't allow us to share it  here you have the url  http   www megaupload com  d n7uj84w5 although i'm on vacation time for a week i've done some kind of research by opening two models of rims and found that   rim that loses spokes  spokes are done only by one single edge each  rim that doesn't lose spokes  spokers are done by one cylinder each doesn't matter if you use three js exporter on blender or the convert_obj_three py script  the spokes disappear too  thx 
my mac os version is 10 6 x  i tried in all browsers from chrome 15 x  safari 5 x to firefox 8 x but it's always hang or very slow when open the example  if i install safari 5 x in window 7  it works fine  so i think this is mac os problem 
http   jsfiddle net corsaronero qhdgw  i'm sorry  but no practical sonop should come out of the balls and inside images
i just had to use perspective camera and raise the far value
what kind of collisions there are  i want to check the collision of the camera vs any of the objects in the scene  so instead the cube in the example i consider the camera as a cube and check if any of the sides collide vs any object in the scene  so if i want the character to be of 100 width and i walk on the front i would check the left and right side of the camera  what would be camera position x   50 and camera position x +50
i fixed that  that particular error is gone but it still doesn't render anything  i'm starting to understand what's happening in the code here  is there an upto date tutorial on creating a basic model in blender  exporting that and rendering that on three js 
 mrdoob osx 10 9 4  gpu  amd radeon hd 6750m 1024 mb  does not happen in safari or chrome  i'm using a macbookpro  2 3 ghz intel i7   westlangley why do you think i'm using r 50  the links and images i've posted at stackoverflow are not my work  the last two links i added in the comments are both r 68   fwiw  my work is with r 59  and i am not always seeing the issue  i've no sense yet of what is causing the issue  
sorry    here is the code for it it worked on the orbit lines that are circle like so i thought i will work here too
i meant i will put this file to the package  https   github com mrdoob three js blob master license as the license of three js which is i should do because of the license itself  "the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software "
i am trying to use the ray object instead  when i changed to it  everything went absolutely haywire  so it will take some time for me to sort things out 
ahh  i figured it out  that is used for repeating textures  i had a "stone" texture that was repeated along the face of the wall over and over  i think that's what 0v values outside of 0 1 mean  no update was required on the python convertor  all i had to do was add some values to my texture   i found this on another post  but i'll put it here for any future visitor with this same question 
no   below is the source  thanks 
sure should not be a problem since i have already implementing this stuff in opengl c++ in my open source project  opencloth http   code google com p opencloth  so it's just a matter of translation of code from c++ to javascript   
something like this http   www graphycalc com 
source is both your dev and r47 version  client browser all  safari  chrome  firefox  opera 12 and ie9  canvasrender  server works over mac osx 10 6 8 and fails over iis7 over windows 7 and over windows server 2008 r2 how can i check what is happenning probably some differences on …   
i needed to tweak  three material  parameters instead of creating a new material like this 
i have a bunch of materials  each one has a pair of shaders with various features that i want to enable disable occasionally  i don't want to do the feature enabling at runtime with uniforms   it would be too slow every material in the scene to be executing unused code in the gpu  however  i do want to be able to pick  on a per mesh basis  a shader pair with a certain feature enabled when necessary  this is a pretty common thing to do in game programming  i'd rather have all the shader compilation done upfront  or at least be cached so as to reduce the overhead of effect transitions  so  is there any efficient way to do this 
thank you  you guys are great  the code in dev branch resolved my problem  just for reference  here's a code demonstrating the original problem  click a couple of times on +y or  y buttons   http   www wingooli com homam three js tests rotation rotation original htm and here's the same code using the dev build  http   www wingooli com homam three js tests rotation rotation dev htm
the issue with the z order  if that's the correct term  appears in all browsers  but in safari the texture seems to be corrupted too  here is a screenshot showing both renderers  http   www phunkei de canvas issue jpg
the ability to add "target"  is it there in directional light or anything other light 
i'm sorry but i can't show more than this partial screenshot  with a red background to see the holes   http   i40 servimg com u f40 13 20 89 97 screen10 jpg these holes are not always visible depending on the camera distance angle  the camer target is x   538711  y   5742553  when i move near the world origin there is no issue  nb  i didn't change the webgl renderer precision  still  highp  
 zz85 that's a really good point   i'm not sure whether my version is doing too much "magic"  read  it's abstracted too much away from the end user    mrdoob's version is nice  clean  and minimal  and maybe that's what's actually needed  personally  i prefer my implementation  but that's only because that's the way i like to work  put the complications behind the scenes  and have a hopefully simple api to use instead   if i weren't me  though  and i came across my version  i daresay i wouldn't actually learn what is going on behind the scenes because i simply wouldn't have to care about it  and that might be a problem  the most pertinent question is what the majority of three js users preferred working style is 
sure  i'll give it a shot  got my hands a bit full converting from geometry    buffergeometry  but would make a nice break 
 gero3 update the worldmatrix  i don't know how to do that can you give me an example  i think maybe this can solve the problem
yes i'm exporting them from maya 2011  with default settings  tried it with a simple primitive sphere and a unwrapped and fully textured model with more complex geometry  result is the same   
you are a legend   thanks  worked perfect
this is my code  thanks 
ahhh  i see what you mean  a separate vertex and fragment shader with code from webglshaders js  in my first post i used the original code from the example   the fragmentshader is nonsense  i have no idea for the correct code  it's more a quiz for me     
i can try to create a jsfiddle to show the problem by tomorrow  but it's probably my lack of knowledge of the repository as well ass euler angles that slows me down   if you had three sets of coordinates and three sets of angles in space  where the second set is relative to the first and the third set is relative to the second  how would you do these transformations with eulerorder 'zyx  if i've understood correctely  geometry position x   value      positions the geometry relative to the global coord system geometry translatex  value        positions the geometry relative to the local coord system is there a similar technique for rotations 
no  it's dynamically generated throughout the duration of the piece 
i used the console logging in webgl_camera html  and confirmed that the keycodes are as expected  ascii character are mainly unchanged in european keyboards   same problem with that programm  cannot use o and p  always opens search  i also tested with all add ons disabled  firexfox 12 0  confirmed on two other computers  32 bit and 64 bit  
done   https   github com mrdoob three js pull 2051
i used a model named "seymour_anim2 dae" from http   collada org owl browse php sess 0 parent 131 expand 0 order name curview 0 it should have a skeletal animation that makes the model jump in the air and move its joints  but i have not succeeded animating the model with three js 
why do the extra math sqrt  as far as i can tell  it's completely unnecessary 
right   morph loop  is more informative than  morph clampedloop   actually  there's now two kinds of information about the animation  1  which direction it is playing 2  what happens when the animation finishes the second point can  with this suggestion  take on three values  a   stop the animation  b   start it again from the beginning  or c   reverse the direction and continue playing  this can be either implemented with the two flags  morph loop  and  morph mirroredloop  or with one variable that holds one of the three enumeration values  a  b  or c   first i thought using the enumeration would be the more correct solution  but i am not javascript expert and it would probably break the existing api  so i'll leave that to you 
http   jsfiddle net wsg7w 3  note  i didn't add the font javascript file because the code breaks before it's needed 
sure  as long as someone double checks i don't comment anything wrong  i'll close this since i'm doing it 
because i didn't find any other way to change size of mesh  or geometry  during animation process  i used tween and scale to disappear mesh gradually   new tween tween  mesh scale   to  y  0  time  easing  tween easing quadratic easeinout  start   
yes  pure webgl demos like  quake 3 webgl demo  http   media tojicode com q3bsp   and  webgl water  http   madebyevan com webgl water   run fine under node webkit 
yes  i'm actually using three dart  i'll first make changes in dart and after make them to three js  the idea is to not use steps blindly but with some heuristic  on straight line3d always have just 1 set  for curved lines  spline  closedspline  etc    use the step number  for composed curves  curvepath  multiply the steps by the number of curved lines and add 1 for every straight line  this will make it necessary to have specific u array with all the steps as they will not be uniform  especially to create the frenetframes   an option would be for the step argument also be able to receive an array with u's so we can know them in advance and be able to create our own frenet frames  as we go into the future  may change from step to angle tolerant  what do you think  
after digging through the bulk of threejs code  i doubt that it would have much impact on performance  it would certainly help in transforming normals  tangents  and binormals  which should be manipulated not by the direct matrices but by their inverse transpose matrices  important when generating worldspace based nbt frames  mixing normals  etc 
 html   body   div id "webgl_container_1" onclick"init_webgl 1  " style "border  1px solid blue"   input type "button" value "activate rendering in div1" onclick "init_webgl 1  "    div   div id "webgl_container_2" onclick"init_webgl 2  " style "border  1px solid red"   input type "button" value "activate rendering in div2" onclick "init_webgl 2  "    div    body    html   script type "text javascript" src "build three js"   script   script type "text javascript" src "js controls trackballcontrols js"   script   surprise  surprise  i did a very basic test with the controls  there is still memory leaking but in this basis test it is only around 1mb instead of 50 mb in a more complex scenario per click in chrome  i am not sure why the activation of the controls in a more complex scenario causes such a high memory leak  maybe it is some side effects with gwt deveoplment 
in chrome and safari it works fine  the error appears only with firefox  windows and mac  
the purpose is to simplify code by taking specific behaviors out of the animation loop  and attaching behavior to objects explicitly  based on the example in the readme  it would look something like this   the other advantage is that entire scenes and their behavior can be easily unloaded and swapped with another scene  because the behavior is attached to the objects in the scene  and the callbacks within the previous scene are no longer called when another scene is loaded  
i suppose i expect it to work as a shorthand for copying position quarternion scale  and any other class specific properties like fov  aspectratio  and projectionmatrix  etc  for example  i’ll have  camera copy othercamera   in the update loop  with the intention to copy the camera settings  however  if that other camera instance had children  they will be copied and added each frame  increasing the memory each frame  if copying properties from a parent object  that causes the infinite loop 
actually i am not really good with github  i havent used it before  you can take the code and apply it if you want 
after some more digging  this seems to be caused by some other code i have running  closing 
yep  thanks  have issued a pull request 
i think that specifying those options in the parameter list should assign them appropriately in the constructor  i don't see the use case for autoclear and it's brethren  webglrenderer render should clear by default  and an optional parameter should disable clearing for that draw  how it is now   when is autoclear necessary  all it does is override the user's own parameter of "false" to the render function  now  case 1  i want to clear each frame     call render without specifying clear parameter case 2  i want to clear some frames     disable autoclear and specify clear parameter after removing autoclear  case 1  i want to clear each frame     call render without specifying clear parameter case 2  i want to clear some frames     disable autoclear and specify clear parameter as you can see the autoclear flag is just plain useless now  the only thing it adds is the undesirable situation where you specify to not clear in the render function and autoclear overrides that  why wouldn't you want to allow specification of those options in the constructor  in general with javascript i think its not the greatest idea to encourage mutating instance variables without a method in a library that doesn't really distinguish private and public variables  say i mutated renderer antialias after the constructor was run  expecting it to behave appropriately  because i can't be sure any data members of a class are going to have an effect  i think it's desirable to either prefix each member "p_" for private  "ro_" for read only  or to only allow mutation through function  method  calls 
  size   float      size of the text   height   float      thickness to extrude text i am not sure if it has size or height at all  but either way it can be used on any shape not just text

minified version of the three js always prints the version of the renderer being used  "three webglrenderer 58"   i consider this debug and i think minified versions are used in webpage releases  if i want to debug my webpage i just use the non minified version 
in my view the goal would be to import the lines color too  it doesn't currently   so i suppose i should have make a "objmtllinesloader" that allow to do this   i don't know if it's relevant to add lines support in obj mlt loader  may be with an option    since it is not the same type of geometry and material    what sould i do to "contribute the house example"  i'm a beginner with github too      
just zoom in and out with this as your element css   element   width  512px  height  256px  box shadow  0px 0px 20px rgba 0 255 255 0 5   border  1px solid rgba 127 255 255 0 25   cursor  default    you'll notice right away there's some clipping issue  objects are popping in and out 
ok  here is a loadable threejs scene  http   snk to f cdhjeccd and here a blender file describing the scene http   snk to f cdu9ykk7 one of the walls has a pinboard  i would expect this to have a darkly colored frame  while the center should use a corklike texture  it renders fine in blender but not in webgl threejs  where the center is just plain white  i've been experimenting with different settings to get textures onto meshes  if there is a certain way this should be done  maybe a pointer to respective documentation would help  generally i feel that lights and materials are a big subject with any amount of gotchas and some directions would be good  the patch  i am working on  also needs documentation  it is unfortunately not obvious what threejs does or can do with lights  that are exported from blender 
sure  compare     where flickering occurs and mesh frustumculled is not altered to     where mesh frustumculled is set to false for all planes before rendering  also  those particles floating around are just textures on planes  if they are set to appear within the frustum and never outside of it  the flickering during that part doesn't occur  even if they wander outside of it after creation  it seems to me to be caused when they are created then added to the scene while outside the frustum and hence immediately culled  it's like the error only occurs if you try to manipulate it  in this case the position by tweening  before it enters the frustum  but this functionality is somewhat desired if you want to move something from initially off the screen to on the screen 
no  i'm on r58  i'll try the dev to test it  i'll came back to you asap  it depends on how many modification i have to do on my code to use dev   thanks
ok  i will share it  wait a minute 
http   shine glowanalytics com  stealth 1 model room7 console 1 the console shows number of intersections detected by the raycaster  js which includes the ray casting  http   goo gl dnzzj7 js which loads the files  http   goo gl likbjb intermediate 3ds file  http   goo gl vjip87 sketchup file  http   goo gl 1tmqdx i have also tried using the collada loader but that loads objects as 3dobjects rather than a mesh  i am not keen on modifying the raycaster to support 3dobjects  i have done a number of experiments and i cannot figure out what causes some objects to have their intersections detectable and others to not be  i created a fresh model in sketchup and exported it  nothing within that model is collidable   change the model url param to "test" 
yeah sure  here it is   http   jsfiddle net utsed 5    you should see 5 geometries in the console  i believe geometry groups aren't properly freed  since  deallocategeometry  in  webglrenderer  iterates over geometry groups without calling  _gl deletebuffer  on vertex buffer  normal buffer  etc    see the deallocation  
yes i'm using two renderers  because i need two scenes in my application  the second is some sort of picture in picture which shows an overview over all objects in the main scene  so i have to clone everything and i had troubles while cloning my particlesystem  like i said  the problem is the texture which is only referenced  in my opinion a clone method produces a complete new object without any references  so i would call this issue a bug  of course i can fix this in my own application by cloning the texture manually  but i wanted to point this out for everyone to think about it  perhaps you agree with my definition of a clone method 
i use the convert_to_threejs py which is put at utils converters fbx 
thank you   mrdoob   i finish the texture mapping in  softwarerenderer   i will continue to implement lighting using the vertex normal  now  i can let my iphone to display web 3d and it is plugin free  it is so fantastic   https   dl dropboxusercontent com u 75721204 softwarerender software_geometry_earth html  
well  that escalated quickly  i'll replace it with custom mesh  thx 
as i said i'm not sure it's a three js bug  1  run "misc_controls_pointerlock html" example  2  click to enter the lock mode   everything works   3  hit escape key to unlock  4  click again to enter the lock  now pointer is locked but mouse movement doesn't rotate camera 
what would i do about defaultattributevalues  if you remove it from there  lightmaps will fail on all the geometry with no 2nd uvs  not sure if having a single pixel of lightmap used is any better 
tbh there are older bugs than this   it is not big deal to fix  though  you could just put something like  etc  so that things like objectloader would not break  or  you could fix it there as well 
well  in this case i needed to remove normals and uvs from obj loader output  i agree that eventually i would convert to json and do not load useless data 
unfortunately this file is 100+ mb and has 20k+ objects  so not simple at all 
since i didn't know when someone will have time to implement it  i used quick hack   not sure if it's useful to anyone 
well if i do loader setpath  i expect everything on the left of _00_a1shape jpeg to be replaced by that path  at least  so http   127 0 0 1 8000 my_path _00_a1shape jpeg

after removing the explicit negative sign on  line 2178  https   github com mrdoob three js blob master utils exporters blender 2 65 scripts addons io_mesh_threejs export_threejs py#l2178  it seems ok  i wonder if it's needed in some situation or might be a typo  _line 2178 _
it also happens on r63
i just sent  bhouston a message   thanks for your help 
 scharnvirk that's not related  in blender you need to set up the normals correctly  try selecting all faces and on the toolbar on the left  go to shading tab   "faces   flat"
ah i see  the controls in my scene were just very big  meaning anywhere i moved the mouse in my scene was a hover event  the issue is that moving the mouse when hovered over the transform controls  not engaged  fires the event  https   github com mrdoob three js blob master examples js controls transformcontrols js#l841 seems like that line should be removed 
 mrdoob yes 
it could be as simple as 
okay  i'm very sorry for wasting your time  but it seems i have misinterpreted something  i actually don't need the function  it was me misreading some model file function definition  you can close this issue

yes  a three webgltexture would be great  but is not as easy as i thought   there are some issues when using this approach  while another three geometry is at the viewport  the webgltexture seems like removed from the material    i think this should be because the texture slot of the webgltexture is static and the engine doesn't know nothing about it so probably is overriding it  i still looking for a good approach to solve this and being able to use our gpu stuff within three js without issues

what is a pr 
i did a console log of  three shaderlib 'lambert'    then replaced all the  #include  with the corresponding  three shaderchunk  in both the vertex and fragment shader  i'm familiar with the shader chunks but not  material onbeforecompile    
so in my real app i'm using sprites for text labels  i use dom canvas objects to draw the text  and use that text as a texture  which is then applied to a plane  the shader then controls various aspects such  size  visibility  etc  the texts  labels  get updated based on what the user is seeing  there could be thousands of labels on screen at any given time  thus  there's a lot of destruction and creation of dynamic labels  i noticed that a lot of memory was being used and eventually the tab died  i narrowed down the problem to the labels  to better isolate the issue i made a jsfiddle that mimics what happens in the real world scenario  but speeds it up from hours into minutes  i based my jsfiddle on the threejs' own memory example  https   threejs org examples #webgl_test_memory the fiddle dies just like my app  after a while  something is for sure killing it  i'm here to get some help from someone who knows more about three js  and webgl  than me  i've not been the first one to find peculiar memory behaviours when using sprites as textures  https   github com mrdoob three js issues 7449 what do you think is wrong with my test  i've also created a fiddle that uses a power of two texture  it takes longer for the tab to die  but still does so  https   jsfiddle net e3a8atsh 1 
doesn't work  its invisible if the geometry is shared and i have lets say one material with a diffusemap lets say and another without  at least from what i tested 
perfect  it works  is it an open gl problem

i'm writing a simple editor for non 3d aware people  decalgeometry was not chosen when i started because the user may want to move or resize the picture added  i choose to use a canvas as a texture because it seems softer on cpu and much more flexible  right now i have no performance issue with that solution  i just have problems with uvs not suitable for my users  for example lathegeometry  top and bottom side of cylindergeometry   in a near future i may have problem with simple deformations  à la sketchup  of a standard geometry  so a solution not focused on uv is welcome 
basically i want to render flat solid colored planes with no shadows  gradients  or textures 
ps  i have included a console log right after the init   function  which writes ltc_1 and 2 into the shaderlib  both ltc_1 and 2 are undefined  because three shaderlib and three module shaderlib are two separate modules  i think this is actually worse  i hope i'm wrong but i believe that any project right now that relies on examples jsm pulls two full threejs bundles  it works if you do   but that's no solution because 100  of all three extension in the eco system pull from 'three'

many monthes ago when groups was added to library i've found answer on so like that https   stackoverflow com a 49708915 4640932 in my app i have 2 meshes on the same position  1  for normal objects 2  for selected objects and when i need select some object s  i've exclude from render by groups some part of normal geometry and include some part of selected geometry  but when no selected objects i must show all geometry from first mesh and i use group from start to infinity  btw similar behaviour used in drawrange https   threejs org docs #api core buffergeometry drawrange if infinity is a problem   ok  i will change my behaviour to real count but it require more operations for calculate actual length
will do  +1 
sorry it's a huge non isolated pile of code  i just bypassed it  and i'll move on to something else  and while googling for this problem i actually found that i should have used another part of the api  the drawcalls     here is the removal commit  as the head of the trail  https   github com nraynaud webgcode commit 3f8463af8c4a7cc87fbef37d9d728caf6656f7c0 when increasing the size of an indexed bufferedgeometry representing a polyline  the error would pop  when checking in js  all the indices in the index buffer were smaller than the position buffer length  ie i had no overflow   as if the new index buffer was uploaded and the object rendered before the new position buffer was uploaded  you are welcome to close if you don't want to dig into my code

actually  this is more pervasive than i initially thought   it happens on more than nexus  there is a fiddle here  antialias   false   https   jsfiddle net 3s7ha8hq 5   antialias   true   https   jsfiddle net 3s7ha8hq 4  the green area should start fading to white from very near the camera plane  the fog effect gets pushed way back when antialias   true  this happens on the following devices i tested on    nexus 7  2013   marshmallow  adreno 320 gpu    sony xperia m2  lollipop  adreno 305 gpu    motorola moto e 4g 2nd generation  lollipop  adreno 306 gpu  this device works fine  huawei honor 4x  kitkat  arm mali 450mp4 gpu  
is there nobody else with this same problem 
   edit once i applied loc rot scale  exported as geometry instead of buffergeom  things started to work somewhat better   see edit 2  in the editor for the test scene  although the floor plane was invisible with 'skinning' enabled on it  and the animated objects seem to be in the correct place  i need to make two materials it seems  because skinning is not liked when there are no bones attached to the objects using the materials  i may end up uploading the original scene i'm having troubles with to see if anyone can help me figure out what i'm doing wrong     edit 2  i forgot applying location puts the origin to the center of the scene  so once i selected everything  put origin to center of mass  control+alt+shift+c with everything selected  the animated objects again move to near origin  and there's some nifty screen tearing going on as well   https   github com mrdoob three js files 1027677 multi_armature_test_scene zip  this is hopefully the new test files if i didn't screw up uploading somehow      edit apologies for the delay in response  this is a small scene with a single material and texture with a few primitives  two armatures  two rest poses and two animations embedded  along with the json output from io_three   removed old file     i think it's got flipped normals on floor  but that's my fault for sure  i didn't spend much time making it  but it sure highlights this issue i think when loading it into the three editor    test_screen_shot  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 76805 26430835 8fc7ec1c 40ad 11e7 85af 4f80b535e6e4 png 
i'm afraid it's not a very compelling one   i was hunting for a way to easily merge indexed  buffergeometry  objects together  and was testing if i could merge them as regular  geometry  objects as a first approach  the merge worked fine  but all the materials were set to the first material in the  multimaterial  for the  mesh  i subsequently created   the geometries in question use  multimaterial   
the project i'm working on can't really take advantage of much of three's built in shaders  but happily works with the rest of three's rendering logic  i've been interested in moving away from  shadermaterial  in favor of  rawshadermaterial   but doing so means i lose the ability to use  #define  and have to resort to branching in various places  i guess i'm expected to write my own shader framework if i'm going to ditch  shadermaterial    is that right 
im trying to load texture  map it on a plane in the texture's original size  and leave the rest of the plane in white color  so i use this          thats a little complicated  but do the job for small planes  when i tried this on big size   1000    1000   plane  the editor crashed 
i'll give that a shot and get back to you 
in the nrrd file you have two parts   a header with information about the type and size of the data and then the data  the data are the values of all the voxels in a parallelepiped whose size is given in a header  i believe we can return a typed array with all the values and a header object  from this volume of data  the user can easily extract slices in any of the three perpendicular directions   if you rotate the xtk demo after turning on volume rendering  you will see that the direction of the plans is changing according to the camera  marching cube can be used to extract a mesh  but i work in the medical field and most of the time we just want to display the three perpendicular slices  like in the xtk demo when you turn off volume rendering  le 1 mars 2016 11 21 am  "mr doob" notifications github com a écrit

haven't fiddled in ages  will try  but you can look at those two lines and it's pretty straight forward   
everything linux mint 17 3 repositories can provide  as i've mentioned  it was running   fine   on firefox last month  it runs fine in chromium now  what am i concerned is i don't know how many of low budget users has the same problem 
my project currently doesn't use the new material stencil parameters  i use the  maskpass  to apply post processing effects to portions of the screen  here's an example that uses  three  r106  https   vanruesc github io postprocessing public demo #pixelation
for now only the fiddle i posted above   updated here https   jsfiddle net b5uvqeh1 2   that show 30x to 200x speedup by just avoiding object defineproperties  this also apply to function prototype  where the function call time is reduced  by changing the fiddle loop cycle count from 10000 to 500  i belive at least 500 functions   variable accesses are made for a single frame   in the machine where i'm currently working on  i7 3558u    1 ms for loop b and  3ms for loop a in booth chorme and firefox and a 8ms delta in ms edge  the possible 3ms gain is enough to jump from 50fps to 60fps  so its a considerable performance boost 
i have no idea what else would need to be changed in the library  but in this particular function ray origin could be set in the camera plane by replacing    1  in   with   camera near + camera far     camera near   camera far  
yes  sorry  forgot to specifically mention that i was talking about convert_to_threejs py  my bad

 mrdoob  like you did  i observed running your example  and mine  in firefox did not produce a memory leak  it also appears there have been other issues reported of memory leaks in chrome's gpu process  which leads me to believe i found another instance of this  so  i filed a new issue with chromium here  https   bugs chromium org p chromium issues detail id 634012  mrdumb  thanks for posting your example  i didn't see a looping video inside  unless one manually replays the katy perry video  which makes it difficult to use as a test case  nice example though 
yeah sure  it's here  https   kentjames github io solar system  set the camera focus to anything other than the sun and try orbiting around it  you will notice that the lens flare stays fixed in a straight line axis like this sun       planet      flare i tried tracing it through the library and it looks like the screen position vector is where the issue is

thanks for your reply  i hava sent you an e mail with the fbx file  xd
 jostschmithals my gosh  you're right  i forgot that i had exported  and perhaps manually edited  the json file a long time ago  it used to include the following syntax  "position"   "type" "float32array"  "array"  0  30  29            "itemsize" 90048   i re exported using the latest blender exporter  and i got "position"   "type" "float32array"  "array"  0  30  29            "itemsize" 3   so yes  you're right  to calculate the array length  i should've been using  geometry count   2   instead of  geometry itemsize   2   i'm guessing r83 used to be more forgiving  glad to admit that it was an oversight on my part 
 mugen87 sure  i could probably tackle this next week 
sure 
do you mean other than 3js  i couldn't find anywhere else to load and test gltf files  but i exported the animation as an fbx from maya and it works when reimporting into maya   i then converted it to gltf with assimp

 mrdoob i tried to use objectloader at first but it didn't work with me producing this error     three objectloader  can't load       robot js  use three jsonloader instead    so i used jsonloader   and that is what is used in most of the tutorials i have seen 
thank you  that was fast  it seems to have fixed the issue with fbx models made from blender  but fbx models made from cinema4d are still experiencing issues 
not really  i'll see if i can find a file i'm allowed to share 
sorry for my poor english  well  i ment this post have enogh details  this code fragment  which need fix  when i give customblending parameter  this code first set normalblending  then do some check  if   blending     customblending     if   blendsrc     currentblendsrc    blenddst     currentblenddst       this may either enable customblending or not enable because some arbitrary conditions  then normalblending will be enabled anyway  in my view  need replace last "else" statement with "else if  blending     customblending " in order prevent this 
i tried resetting the zoom factor as 0 0 when it goes in negative  even it is not helping to resolve the issue 
providing a fiddle for it will be difficult  this guy faces a same issue   https   stackoverflow com questions 44373088 web gl rendering issue in chrome 58 and yes  it works fine with firefox  the issue started with chrome v58 and that too on certain android phones like mi  letv  it works fine with other phones like nexus 4 5 one plus 3 and many more

yes that does solve the problem 
thanks looeee  that's given us enough of a steer to get the animations exporting properly  when exporting anims from maya to fbx for three js  frame 0 has to be the bind pose  this must be keyed and maya must be on that frame when you export  it does not need to be included in a clip  do not let the exporter bake animation  all anim must be created at 30fps clips do not need padding or extra frames  if they do not look correct an export setting is wrong  below are the settings from maya 2017 u4   maya fbx settings 2  https   user images githubusercontent com 1826895 31382917 213832cc adb1 11e7 915f 34676300bc50 png    maya fbx settings 1  https   user images githubusercontent com 1826895 31382918 21546bfe adb1 11e7 954e d721d84c1d3b png  hopefully this helps anyone else that stumbles across this 
i double checked the remote developer console but nothing  as i used the official websites three js version is already 88  but the same problem is for 87  based on the webglreport com the browser supports webgl 1   2  for webgl2 it mentions that 88 of 88 functions are implemented    screenshot webglreport bt300  https   user images githubusercontent com 22236466 32481704 d8a06620 c394 11e7 910a 6e5a4b5dbd34 jpg    screenshot 1510039293599  https   user images githubusercontent com 22236466 32481709 dfc8334c c394 11e7 8bd7 17856b639ded jpg    screenshot 1510039349469  https   user images githubusercontent com 22236466 32481721 e7ea628e c394 11e7 8c0f 6959bdb11945 jpg

sure  i'll throw one together 
ah  because i don't know any better  makes sense now you point it out  but it's not obvious from a user's perspective  and it's not mentioned in the documentation for material  and a lot of examples contain that line  which i assumed was harmless   perhaps it could handle this case a bit more gracefully  either a warning or not randomly getting removed 
sounds very practical  reference card are though very minimalist  but would serve the purpose very well

wow  missing that three module js was not my greatest achievement today  it would help though  if inside the documentation   https   threejs org docs #manual en introduction import via modules   the import statement would be changed accordingly  or there was some sentence pointing to the existence of a special build for the use as a module  i think otherwise other people could fall into the same trap as i did   they might however notice the module file before opening a git issue   
thanks  it did fix my issue  although after loading exported model  objects of type three group are now of type three object3d  it makes no difference for me  but could you please explain why it was done like this 
is there some solution for this problem  this seems to be a little different from #15393  
yes  firefox does not have this issue 
the issues is  when i released all reference to webglrenderer  the renderer cant be gced  except you have disposed all the material you have used in this renderer 
i have made  a test  https   github com depickeresven threejs pcdloader memory  case so you can try to simulate it  you need to run a server that is located in the folder  node  you can run it by  npm start  the web app is located in the folder  webapp  you can run it by  npm run serve  the standard threejs library files are located in the following folder   webapp src assets js vue live threejs libs  the code above i was referring to  is located here  https   github com depickeresven threejs pcdloader memory blob master webapp src assets js vue live threejs init js#l85 l95    i tested my test case now it gives the memory error at 3 8gb see screenshot  i placed a counter in the number of requests he sends and now crashes he at the 297 request    crash  https   user images githubusercontent com 26543813 55460306 418bc080 5624 11e9 8a23 554d3a4a1e09 jpg  i use firefox developer as browser if you have other questions feel free to ask 
but it has loaded some  gltf files with  tga textures very well so i thought it would be a bug  to be honest  i used 3ds max + babylon plugin to export the  gltf file because the original 3ds max could not export  gltf files and the babylon plugin has no such an export option to choose the type of the texture 
sure  i'll do a pr 
i investigated it further  when i switched firefox version  nothing changed  didn't try to change mesa  because this can get messy because of all the dependencies  but with ubuntu 18 4 3 live  which has mesa 19 0  the problem also doesn't show up  ubuntu 19 10 and arch with mesa 19 2 both have it  but it only shows up in firefox  i'll report to mesa gitlab  because while it only shows up in firefox  it was caused by some change there  edit  here it is  https   gitlab freedesktop org mesa mesa issues 1991

yes i can work around the issue easily by just adding vertex colors to the meshes that currently lack them  or i could add such code to the loader that it would assume default color for all vertices  but this would bloat the file  i will look into the other formats  but i like the simplicity of specifying sharp smooth edges using per face vertex normals in obj

hello  apologies for the late reply  the link with the incorrect instructions to install the new firmware is here  http   arduino cc en hacking wifishieldfirmwareupgrading  and the github link for the code to install is here  https   github com arduino arduino tree master hardware arduino firmwares the url with the correct firmware code is  https   github com arduino arduino tree master hardware arduino avr firmwares wifishield regards  jeff on 9 march 2015 at 01 43  captcoonoor notifications github com wrote 
yes  looks like attachements filtered  honnestly  i'm not blocked by the issue   compile with ide1 5 5 works    my intention was only to report it for improvement for futur versions  i will try to get ifdef out and let you know later on 
no  it doesn't  i have a several arduino versions folders  installed one and few non admin   has it influence  i think it has  because i see  that there is ethernet version 1 1 0 in 1 6 6 library folder  i think that gui reads config from an old  1 0 6  installed version folder  users    appdata local      is there any possibility to change this behaviour 
when i close arduino and open it again  everything is fine again  i don't want to use line numbers  greetz chris
hi paul  thank you for answering  i tried it with bot original and clone  it was the same behavior  i tried it on either ide 1 6 2 and 1 6 3   it was always the same  later i will try to update the bootloader    best regards franz am 04 04 2015 12 47  schrieb paul stoffregen

i noticed windows was running slowly and using a lot of memory so i checked taskmanager  i can see conhost starting and stopping continuously in the 'processes' tab  when i close the ide  conhost stops trying to start and the pc goes back to normal so i'm guessing the ide is triggering the effect one way or another  many thanks for your interest  martin
 chris  a nice job  thanks  should we remove the spaces before end of each line 
maybe an additional script for those who do have the privileges  everything will continue to work the same way  but those who wish can get a shortcut to dash   also  why isn't arduino package updated in the ubuntu repos  
how to reproduce  1  install arduino ide v1 6 9 2  install mkr1000 board support from the boards manager 3  check that "basics  blink" example compiles fine for mkr1000 board  4  configure additional boards manager source  https   redbearlab github io arduino package_redbear_index json 5  install redbead duo package the boards manager 6  "basics  blink" example compilation   fails for target mkr1000 board    7  see in detailed compilation log  that the wrong toolchain is selected 
 matthijskooijman  ffissore yes  exactly  i have specified a   board structure  and it is not avr  so why is avr libraries included  and yes  i do have all necessary libs  since it works just fine when i use the ide in gui mode and select the generic board for that architecture in the menu and compile  then the correct libraries are referenced  from the gui console   the esp8266 package is installed from here  https   github com esp8266 arduino however  i have noticed something interesting  when i have opened and compiled using the gui  it suddenly works to compile from console  with the same arguments that did not work before   so the gui set some magical properties when executed that the console version inherits somehow 
that is a good question  i don't know the answer  i will need some more time to investigate this issue and possible solution  i found out that compiler java contains code that writes that "#line" into the  ino  i guess i could try to download arduino sources and modify that part and try something  i'm thinking to modify it so that it adds full path of  ino into the  cpp  do you know if that is possible   maybe that will help but i don't believe it is enough  it might be hard to come up with proper solution without breaking existing functionality  but let's see 
yes please 
makelangelo firmware was already fixed when i reported the error  add the keyword "static" to any method in the firmware and try to recompile

our system is set up that uses windows mandatory profiles and it uses environment variables rather than registry  we cannot execute any program using the arduino ide  for us to be able to use the arduino ide we need it to check environment variables first rather than the registry

yes it happens after some minutes of editing code  it happend mostly the whole time  i re installed the ide with same effect  am 01 02 2016 um 09 56 schrieb matthijs kooijman  ## grüße lars
it should affect both avr and sam  bug #4511 explains this issue in detail  here's an example snippet   basically  "this should not happen" when you're writing a c++  or c  compliant program  doing so is forbidden according to the standard  so the compiler is free to assume that it will never happen when optimizing the code  which happens with   o2  or greater  which is what arduino uses   gcc provides a   fwrapv  option to override this behavior  as i mentioned in issue #4511 and pr #4624  honestly i'd prefer this "bug" to be fixed rather than documented  but even if it gets fixed it might be important to document it in case someone's using an old version  ps  as i said i haven't physically tested this code snippet  although i did back in the day   and undefined behavior being undefined behavior it might be possible that it does something unexpected such as working 
hi  i don't have an aggressive antivirus  with regard to 'enforced protections' is this system integrity protection  thanks
no  i am just basing this on compiling a sketch i have had in existence since 2013 that uses the  oopinchageint  https   github com greygnome oopinchangeint  required by the  adaencoder  library    i understand your point  and since the changes came from upstream  will probably not get changed back  so i guess i will either have to come up with multiple versions of this sketch or provide my own dummy defines so that the existing libraries  not my own  compiles 
dear martino  thank you for your quick answer  double clicking reset button did work  the board shows in ide now  sorry i must have missed that information when reading your “getting started”  for the record though i include the screenshot from usb hardware tab  best regards  michal # “do or do not    there is no try ” yoda
the code isn't running in an isr  it's just placed in " init0" so that it's the first thing running after the bootloader  which in this case is optiboot 6 2   the code is "test_reset ino" from the optiboot project  if compiled as is using arduino ide 1 6 11 the function resetflagsinit   will not be linked into " init0" so the reset cause will never be available in register r2  as provided by the bootloader   you will always see a reset value of 0x0  removing the  currently commented  dummy line  which never executes because the reset flags will never be 0xee  forces the code to be linked and now you'll get reset value of 0x8 which is correct  wdt reset   you get the same effect if you remove  os  optimization    _here's the compilation output _ c  program files arduino arduino builder

hourly build seems to have solved the issue  thanks facchinm 
i've done that already  and there is no extra output from the console   it's like the debug program does not catch any errors or exceptions 
i suspect the problem is not in the particular libraries used  unless it's the serial library   i get the same error when i try to compile the following 
arduino genuinomega 2560  atmega 2560  and arduino genuino uno
yes  i can access the m328 with avrdude via command line with  p  dev ttyusb0 
yes  q2dg i changed the library to also cover the receipt of ir codes  so i created the irremotecontrol library  issue #6578

thanks cristian  yes you can  i forgot it 
sorry for the reply sir  yes i use the version from the windows app store  thank you for the reply sir  hope that the update fix will help

actually  i didn't run install sh at all  i just extracted the  tar gz  note there are no installation instructions whatsoever in the download page  and noticed there was an executable called "arduino"  so i launched it  and it worked  i do have processing 2 2 1  i'm not sure i ever "installed" that one either   so maybe at some point some "association" has been made between whatever binary is at the core of both and that icon  in my opinion there must be something deeply wrong either in the way ubuntu manages applications or in some or both of these two particular applications for this to happen  even assuming i did something wrong 
indeed  don't see how i could do that  i do not even manage to start the app using the start command at all  this is why i hate windows store apps on a pc

hi  i like the new interface  better than what it was before  and it was fairly easy for me to get around the code  afaik the table options such as collation  default character set  engine etc  only come in the end and are all separated by whitespace in a 'create table statement'  https   github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize query generator js#l11 https   github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize query generator js#l22 25 https   github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize model definition js#l54 additional table creation options could be separately passed inside options    tableoptions     engine   'innodb'  'default character set'   'big5'    
i'm working more with entity __factory associations  which seems to have about the same info as model associations  determining the relation type  one to many  etc  seems like a bit of guesswork  as there isn't any clear info on that  maybe just adding something like "associationtype  onetomany" to each association would do the trick  also  i noticed that many to one associations don't have the "accessors" array of functions  although they are later declared on the entity itself 
looks like it works as expected on master  thanks 
i guess people misunderstand  i was just wondering why sequelize source has little to none semicolons  i have to admit  i'm great supporter of using semicolons  heck i wouldn't mind to convert sequelize  however i have to agree that it is important that you respect some1 elses code style

 durango yes  i did install pg  i found the sequelize is not in my local path  what is the best practice   durango thanks for the hint 
 mickhansen i use sequelize 1 7 0 without  raw  true  has same problem
the above is just something i created on the spot  but definitions and associations would probably look like this 
nope  i'm afraid not  see my other issue  #944  https   github com sequelize sequelize issues 944  
current master branch
yep  it is a self association  same thing when i use through  as is   i get the same error    object groups_outsourcing_companies has no method 'init'   my group model is pretty big  but there's nothing really special about it  just lots of fields  an aftercreate hook  a couple of instance methods  not too sure what more i can provide 
yeah  i figured with the dao change  we might of have that  i'll have to refactor a lot of code  that's how i made it work before  i think i may of figured out why this is happening  in my controller  i have the following   so i tell it just to update the attributes that has been requested to be updated  so if i change another value in my hook  it doesn't update it  as it's not in the "object keys req body  concat 'id' " array  this behavior didn't happen before  probably because my values before was limited to the array i provided it  so if i added a key in the array  it updated that value because it updated everything in that array 
ok  working on it 
my mistake  it was indeed working   the issue stemmed from the process of updating the instance  which is another topic deserving of another issue  this can be closed  thank you for the clarification 
sorry guys  i installed the v2 beta by mistake  it works for 1 7 
seems like it might     support ident authentications  in which case peer authentications wouldn't be too far off
sure thing  contentblock 
i'll mess around with it a bit more to see if i can give a bit more info   i've not done much testing yet as far as tdd bdd goes  getting started with it using mocha chai  
so i'm using v 2 0 beta 2 at the moment     i figured by the time i am releasing the thing i'm working on that v2 is the best approach  
sorry forgot that  v 1 7 0 rc8 
figured out what the problem was  i was pulling all blocks from the table and one of those blocks did not have a worker because it was 'corrupted'  it's worker value was null so sequelize threw an error  is there any way to have sequelize keep going instead of exiting when it finds a null value like that 
v2 0 0 dev10 i'm passing the query through from the browsers query string   doing some transforming  what you are suggesting is not the same   getting all of projects that belong to user age   3  is not the same as getting all projects  then including only users with age   3   unless i'm mistaken the above syntax
e g  i have some models   i want to get followers  but use offset and limit  i want to get a object like    count      rows        
i am using postgresql 9 3 5 and sequelize 2 0 0 rc1
not by default  from the docs http   www postgresql org docs current static uuid ossp html   one has to install the ossp module which could do that  otherwise write a sequence which could handle that  but when i do that  how could i refference my sequence in the model definition 
1 7 0 rc3
http   sequelizejs com docs 1 7 8 usage#block 4 line 17
it may return whole rows  deleted ones  or specified columns   so it "behaves" same as  returning  in  update  this is very handy if you want to delete something and then for example send email based on deleted data   instead of fetching row and then deleting it you can just delete and fetch in one query  one server database roundtrip less  
sorry  i totally forgot about this  so it seems that this behaviour is intentional     in my opinion it is totally not intuitive and will cause more trouble than it helps  fortunately it is easy to bypass it like this 
no  i didn't  i do not understand what you mean  because your code is similar to mine  can write a complete example  please

mysql  i'm going to look into this more now 
model definitions with associations  abridged    i put a  console log  near line 1688 in model js  where the error message is emitted  and found that the  validateincludedelements    function was being called twice  the first time it was called with the include block that i passed it in the  find    call  the second time it was called it was passed the array   'groupsusers'   
tried it with version 1 7 0 and 1 7 5
i'm using 1 7 5  and my apologies  if i understand correctly the constraints should really only be defined from the belongto function  right  since it's at that moment being told which table is it's parent  that would make sense to me  but maybe i'm wrong  i've tried adding the ondelete option  but it doesn't seem to make a difference 
the version is rc8  postgres  the code is simple  for example a  b  you call b destroy    then a is deleted as well  however if you call a destroy    the error is raised up  i think maybe i override the destroy   method on instance  now it returns a promise 
 mickhansen no 
 janmeier sequelize 2 0 1
version 1 7 10 
i've modified the code since  but they're mostly just like this 
yes  i fear node inspector doesnt allow this  i'd like to get the results of the queries  it's convenient to check the result sets of queries as i type  maybe i'm the only one with bad habits    i confirm i see the generated sql 
i'm sorry  janmeier  my association between model z and x are fine  but between x and y are not working 
 mickhansen thanks for responding  which sql would this be  this seems to break before any sql gets involved 
i was deleting the db myself  but now i just set the option force to true but it is still not working  here is the updated code 
hi  i'm working at version  2 0 0 rc2   my model definition below 
yeah the code is very simple just define a model and do sync  so not much meaning  i just want to see if sequelize can be used in node webkit now i just use the driver of mysql in node webkit and use sequelize to generate the sql query statement 
sure thing  let's say i have the following model  but it doesn't work  and i can't find out how it should work 
we actually don't use save  so the way we call this is like such  we've been thinking of moving to using promises on the latest but that will take us at least a weeks worth of work to convert our entire app and a clear understanding of whats the best way to convert everything 
it appears to hang indefinitely  with some fiddling in generic pool js i enabled logging and it seemed to run destroy   once  but it does not seem to have destroyed that connection  so it appears the process is genuinely waiting for the connection to close  hanging indefinitely after sequelize close   fails to close it  rather than hanging on something else 
say i have this mapping  childobject belongsto parentobject   foreignkey  'child_id'  as  'child'    now say i've assigned a child object instance to a parent and now i want to set that foreign key back to null undefined so that the child still remains in the database but the parent won't point to it any more  i tried using parent set 'child_id'  null undefined  or parent setchild undefined  and then saving and my change is never persisted because the query that gets executed refuses to set that value to null  so to go around this i'm using sequelize query   with a raw update query and i was wondering if there's a way to do what i need to if sequelize is initialized with omitnull   true  would the alternative be to set omitnull to false and then run the  set   method with   reset   true    is the default sequelize behavior  when omitnull is false  not to overwrite existing values with nulls unless  reset   true  is specified in the setter 
 janmeier yes  in my specific use case an upsert hook would work  i have some functions that i need to run whether a model is created or updated  so i already have   model hook 'aftercreate'  myfunction     model hook 'afterupdate'  myfunction    but for certain use cases i need to do an  upsert  which means that neither of the above runs  so an  afterupsert  hook would be neat 
got sloppy while reading documentation  sorry for raising the issue and thanks for help
interesting thought  unfortunately  the answer is no  i only have a field called  language_id  in the  owner  model 
wow  that’s a quick reaction  thanks  i tested with sequelize 2 0 5  i think the test should check that the generated query contains the value as  in sql  
yes  i have set it to false so that table names are not created with quotes  which is kind of weird on postgres      on tue  apr 14  2015 at 1 43 am  jan aagaard meier  notifications github com
it's simply just a call like   but say for username i allow alphanumeric only  if i give it something invalid it will 'pass' and update the first name value but just keep the original value of username  maybe this is intentional but i think it'd be more helpful to throw an error and be stricter 
the model definition for loyaltypoint  thanks for the fast feedback   
the way i'm doing  tojson  definition is the following  so then there's any way to make it without  ssacl   i mean  i don't want those 2 values in any case  they're used only for auth and shouldn't be available for anyone  well  only for that auth part… 
i noticed something strange  in the log  setstatus  just take 22ms  when i remove the  setstatus   this transaction would take 50ms  and i removed the transaction  this part take more then 1s  and  setstatus  take about 20ms  when i remove the  setstatus   this part take about 50ms  i seem to find the problem    
my mistake  i had a    limit  10    in my query as well  still  i'd assume limit 10 maps to "select top 10"  which doesn't require an order by in ms sql 
## user js
thank you for your answer  i will try it on monday morning 
hello  janmeier i'm trying to add an object to an a collection in another object who has an 'hasmany' association  this is the code   in version v3 2 0 the adduser method send 2 queries   select     from user where projectid     and id is null  insert into user     this read is not necessary    because always returns 0 rows  in version v 3 3 2 the adduser method sends only one query    update user set projectid           where id in  null  the adduser method don't have to send an update in this case    why this "extrange" behaviours  thanks
when i do an order like   order  '"createdat" asc'  everything works fine  however   order   '"createdat" asc'   executes as  order by "createdat asc"  and throws  sequelizedatabaseerror  column "createdat asc" does not exist  the first case is not super helpful because we want to order by multiple json fields  lastname  firstname  
yeah already did that  thanks anyway
i have that left as default  i don't see how that could be affecting this as the query that sequelize is executing is output in the console as "select    from foo '2015 07 01' '2015 07 31'  " it seems that only affects results coming back from the db 
 janmeier  it's not working because postgres treats     as an escape character an thus looks for  foo    string  with percent symbol   it could be easily fixed by adding  escape ''   so  like 'foo   ' escape ''  will work exactly like sqlite equivalent 
internally i assume you will use a find or findall when a model is included  no  i don't think i should call the hook myself  but sequelize should be calling a hook automatically when i include the model  and my goal is to make the model include more associations  so afterfind is not an option  though while you're at it that could be added aswell  here is a code snippet of what i'm trying to achieve  so i suggest either having beforefind called when you include  or having a new hook to handle this 
teammates are on 4 1 1 as well  which is the weird part  officially  sqlite 3 1 should support node 4  but their travis build says otherwise  even though it installs just fine on my computer 
with navicat premium  gui the incorrect value is what is being returned from our api  the value in question doesn't go through any processing  it is just part of the model definition and the return values from the " find" method  i am testing my api with postman 
i see  so it appears that  sequelize mysql  is using  sequelize   1 7 x  as dependency so that's why  datatypes vitrual  is null  that should be the problem thanks 
sure  will do
that should work  although requiring an overwrite of native objects to make something work feels a bit hacky 
unhandled reqection sequelizedatabaseerror  sqlite_error  near "where"  syntax error
it would set the foreign key organisationid on products in this case but potentially any other value that was specified going through the  nested create code  https   github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib instance js#l719  i see that the include object is used to set the foreign key if another option was passed it could be accessed to set values 
you're right  i'll create a bug report over there  the problem is with multiple apostrophes by the way  not a single  edit  see https   github com brianc node postgres issues 934
it should be set to hst   hawaiian standard time  we have people in hawaii and the philippines entering in records  is there a sequelize settings that will store all records as hst

no  i need user role + opts  truly i can't imagine any good semantics for this  thank you 
we upgraded from 1 7 and fixed all breaking changes a couple months ago  we had run these commands successfully under the old api  but probably not with 2 0  this feels like pretty basic functionality  is the only suggested solution to upgrade to 3 0 and deal with the next batch of api and breaking changes 
 sushantdhiman simplifying the queries and reducing # of bytes sent isn't enough of a reason to add a couple lines of code 
i didn't have the text upfront  but i did some digging in the rollbar reports and narrowed the issue down to a string like this   ' u0000foo' 
i have tried the include multiple ways  the through breaks it  when i remove it  it doesn't access the skill table at all include      model   db skill as  'skills'    include      model   db skill   through  'userskills'   as  'skills'   
logged query      unhandled rejection sequelizedatabaseerror  the multi part identifier "offers id" could not be bound      the order clause is getting added in query twice   where is should be at the end on entire query like  sql query  order by id offset 10 rows fetch next 10 rows 
 mickhansen yes i tried  integer unsigned   warring too  i tried use sequelize integer   there is no warring  so i will use  sequelize integer  
 janmeier because it does not insert model id and other properties  let suppose this code  model build name "some name"  setrelation target    id and name will non saved only relation 
is it possible using
 felixfbecker nope  that worked 
options are    include   post     is a transaction the only way to do it  or can we validate both before creating either 
i would have to respectfully disagree as it causing a confusing behavior when something like belongsto follows said behavior when using as  in my example i have made the following associations     in this case belongsto assigns the attribute segmentid to companyemployee companyemployee belongsto team   as  'segment'       in this case hasmany assigned teamid to companyemployee team hasmany companyemployee   as  'segment'    its clear in this example that the associated foreignkey should be consistent  so either make all of them produce teamid or all of them produce segmentid  furthermore  i would still suggest that the foreignkey be segmentid  the aliased name  because the commonly expected foreignkey of a source table generally includes the table name in it  when using the alias it means that for all intents and purposes companyemployee sees a "segment" table and has no knowledge of "team" table  and the reverse should be true as well  as a team i am representing myself as a "segment"  there may be some legitimate case for wanting to alias a table without expecting the default foreignkey to be aliased as well but i can't think of a good one  it seems to be a completely internal effect without the right foreignkey alias as well  whatever the preferred result by the community is  a consistent result needs to be enforced one way or the other 
 felixfbecker i don't think i saw it documented anywhere  just how i would expect it to work   sushantdhiman thanks  i'll check it out 
 felixfbecker   when i call table sync  sequelize will create a table in db  so  i want you may add a similar func to create an udf  maybe createudf ' create function' 
got it working  my  app js  was not correct  this was my last lines in  app js    i guess the  matcher  was not needed 
 sushantdhiman the stored procedure actually sets a value to the output parameter  on executing the sp as a raw query only the select records are recieved in the callback  any idea how we get the output parameters set in sp  here is the code snippet for calling the stored procedure   sequelize query 'exec storedprocedure'       spread function outputvalue   records      console log records         error function err     res json err          
it would be nice if it does it by itself  if it needs the input object to have columns as its properties  i dont see why it shouldn't work with the instance if the model as it has those props  honestly  i didn't think it wont work  seems it can not read the pk from the instance 
yep  in the service layer of my application i just map rows  somthing like

 sushantdhiman  i modified the issue  the one that i created earlier   and then asked you if you will be kind enough to reopen it  after waiting a couple of days  if i remember correctly  pardon me if i don't   i created this new ticket because you never responded after you closed the original issue  yes  i am pretty sure that i am using mysql2    i   produced the entire code   that generates the error  i took the error screenshot and pasted it here because it has the entire stack trace  my only motive when i produced the image was to make it easier for anybody looking at it  to easily decipher where the issue is  as far as the node versions are concerned  please find both the node version as well as npm version below  node  8 4 0 npm  5 3 0
yes  i forgot what it was though  i might've been catching it  but i can responsibly tell you that it wasn't a bug   armadill odyssey
 felixfbecker   i assume you mean just the table  here you go    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 26221061 27024995 bd4e4ed6 4f50 11e7 8bf8 c0fa2c810de7 png 
 damianb sure  i'm aware of the glue thing  we use a different set up in another project but in this project here is our model  index js   i want to emphasize that the query works from  caregiverdevice  and couple of other models where we have  belongsto   so i guess the relationship works 
i tracked down the trojan to this file called "terraformer wkt parser"  https   www virustotal com # file 6f7811fc858fe96fa1aef6ddb741dffbaadd2455df228c9a0efbbdd8860be890 detection you can find this file by going to your node_modules    sequelize    node_modules    terraformer wkt parser so now i'm wondering if i can delete this file and still have sequelize working fine 
it's not always broken  and i tried from many different locations  when it's broken for me  the root page is working  http   docs sequelizejs com   but the others url are not  ex  http   docs sequelizejs com manual tutorial models definition html  today its working  but i got it broken many times 
oh  i see  sorry
the importing is handled by the file index js which is generated by the cli  associations are fine  if i call console log models  within the association block  all models are accounted for  however  if i try to define a scope using include that's where things start breaking down  you should get the same error i'm getting if you try passing undefined as a value in the include array of the scope definition 
i just meant debugging in vscode using hapijs lab test library  with a small number of tables and models on a toy database  as opposed to a "real" legacy database with a few dozen tables  if i recall it turned out i actually been executing the same sequelize define   code multiple times  it was a case of 2 tables with the same name but different schema owners  again  apologies for the fuss 
 simonschick   hi  here is  table a is associated with b with key id1  table b is associated with c with key id2  a hasmany b  b hasmany c expected query result 
it's just a simple code   after this the table does not change  it remains the same 
off course   simonschick i have three   models    ### question
my initial though was that this happens automatically using this   associations  is there a correct way to do that 
yes it does  papb
at first it is documented  but in general i can have multiple associations with the same class like 
 papb   hi  unfortunately that is not a trivial task in my case since there are too many breaking changes to be able to switch to the latest sequelize version and test out the problem  would you have links to any  dummy  sequelize project that uses the latest sequelize version  
after further testing  it looks like the problem is the length of string  i changed column to string type  i did the update from graphql playground and got error  there is no problem when reading the long string back from the database 
i have updated the issue
sure but tomorrow  it's 2 am and i'm kinda sleepy  but thanks for fast reply

 papb thank you for your reply  the    flat   true    comes from my experience with django  i use it all the time because of its convenience and calling  findall  with one column in  attributes  is a common case  laravel eloquent orm also has this kind of feature  i did some searching and found some  many  devs also want this feature like me     use include to return an array of ids  https   github com sequelize sequelize issues 5217     sequelize return array with strings instead of objects  https   stackoverflow com questions 33576129 sequelize return array with strings instead of objects     eloquent orm laravel 5 get array of ids  https   stackoverflow com questions 34308169 eloquent orm laravel 5 get array of ids  i still prefer to implement it  any suggestions for me 
i'm new to both sqlite and sequelize so i can't suggest the best approach  i did google a little bit before submitting my suggestions and they did make no sense    sqlite doesn't support to drop a column or fk    oh    crap    so the only suggestion that left on my list is  parse the fk constraint and delete rows ourselves in the right order  to this suggestion  i added the note  before googling   "at this point  it should probably be a user addon in a different npm or the user should switch to on delete cascade" so i totally agree with you about the feature label   if you still go ahead  and if there is nobody that already did this somewhere   after thinking about it my recommendation would be  close the issue  i should have know sqlite limit 
thanks for your response  unfortunately my schedule has changed  i'll be busy with other projects in the foreseeable future  so won't be able to work on this anytime soon  maybe next year  to be decided

 seberg  frombuffer  only works if you support the old buffer api  i wanted to retain shape information so i implemented the new one  strangely enough even though i have the old buffer methods  numpy still complains  i was assuming that numpy should directly interpret what i passed using the dtype that is passed   np asarray buf  'complex128'   should be equivalent to using  view    instead of performing the conversion to  double  double  first and then typecasting  but i guess this would break conversions  i'll use view then  btw  this could be related to a few issues  #2465  #2213

ok  i will do it soon  thank for the reply 
you are right  that was only a warning  the output posted is all that i get executing the line above i've found the problem  the option '  requires' is causing the problem  passing '  require' goes ahead and work as expected  actually according to python docs the correct parameter is '  requires' and not '  require' https   docs python org 2 0 dist creating rpms html
ok  i see your point  however can't see why it behaves differently for different empty arrays  e g  getting the minimum for  axis 1  and  axis 0  in #2670's example   both are empty  still the minimum will be either an empty array or a  valueerror   to be honest  i would be most happy with a  nan  as a result to  min       at least it seems more reasonable than an error

 ewmoore i understand your concern  but at the moment the docs appear out of sync with code  and that doesn't seem right  i think we need to make it clear what we mean by  usable  and  machine   once we have clear definitions of those  we can then determine whether the doc and or the code needs to change  for example does the term  machine  refer to just the base architecture  or the software compiled for it  if i understand  juliantaylor's comment correctly  the architecture should always support subnormals  however it depends on the compiliation of the software as to whether the end user can use it or not

not sure if this is helpful  but the memory leak also scales with the degree of the polynomial fit  8th degree polynomial fit ends up using  11 gb instead of 6 
in this case  the norm function returns a float scala  in my opinion  it should take care of the overflow  just like the square operation shown below  i understand why it does not  but it's not convenient for the users and is not documented  in  3   a   np array   0  0  256   dtype np int16  in  4   a  2 out 4   array  0  0  0   dtype int16  # overflow here is expected in  6   a 2   2 out 6   65536 # no overflow in  7   type a 2   2  out 7   numpy int64 in  8   type a 2   out 8   numpy int16

sorry  my comment "special case of an algorithm that generally works with n    1 dimensions" was unclear  the example i had in mind was implementing the gauss newton method for nonlinear least squares curve fitting   it would be better to use a solve  but suppose we are being sloppy 😉   the algorithm looks like  def gauss_newton x_data  y_data  param  curve_fn  curve_jacobian_fn   iters   20 for i in range iters   residual   y_data   curve_fn x_data  param  j   curve_jacobian_fn x_data  param  param   param + np linalg inv j t dot j   dot j t dot residual   return param where  curve_jacobian_fn  should return the jacobian of the curve function with respect to the parameters  evaluated at each data point in  x_data   in this case  when the curve function has a single parameter  it is natural  in my opinion  but maybe i'm wrong   to write  curve_jacobian_fn  to return a 1d array  then  j t dot j   is like  14 i tested the tuple index bug in 1 11  you are right  it is replaced by the "must be two dimensional" exception

the fused function is in third party code  stripped down to  numfoo pyx  in the linked gist  it's that during the fused function's dispatching process  which is entirely inside cython's control  something causes an exception inside numpy's internals  it looks like it is related to dynamic creation of user friendly looking wrappers of c functions  but the traceback shown in the issue looks like the sort of thing that ought to happen upon importing something  when both numpy's python layer and its c layer have both been imported already

wel  if you want to use the python included  locale module  you can do this  so at least at my pc  ubuntu 18 04  german  python does not read the lc_numeric from the bash and therefore there it seems that there is no automatic way to adapt the parsing process to the local number conventions  and i don't know how other linux distros windows macs handel the locales  but to switch the topic   pandas  http   pandas pydata org pandas docs stable reference api pandas read_csv html  has already the feature    pandas read_csv "test_data csv"  decimal " "    i asked for  so perhaps you could take some inspiration from them 
thanks for the response  i'll give it a go  the fix seems quite simple  any gotcha's you're aware of

some supporting but not conclusive evidence that this is a numpy issue  not a python pickle issue  is that if i try to do something similar without numpy  it works reliably 
no  but ill try  thanks

hi   indeed  percentile is elmenet wise   when considering  q   which in our case is  np arange 0  1  0 01    100   i expect the output to be sorted because  q  is sorted

so i managed to solve it  and am no longer getting the message  i tried a lot of different things but think what solved it was that i installed visual c++ build tool 14 0 which as i understand it is needed for pip  i am fairly new to python and programming  so maybe someone more experienced could confirm if this could be the solution or if it was something else i did  it works in either case now 
this command is working  the issue is that i'm not able to import numpy and packages dependent on numpy in python through pybind11  any other packages such as "requests" is loading successfully 
hi  both the argsort   and the argpartition   methods allow me to extract top k elements  my request was that since this is a common scenario  could we support this using a single method call  user simply calls np argmaxk arr  k    np maxk arr  k  and gets the k largest elements in sorted order

hmm   this seems to be a python version issue  i made a fresh install of python3 7 6  instead of 3 7 3  and compiled numpy 1 18 1 with respect to mkl just as before but this time all tests passed 
 mattip this is the  link  https   docs scipy org doc numpy reference generated numpy broadcast iters html#numpy broadcast iters  to the broken documentation 
so how can i fix this error  by updating the accelerate backend  i had a search and don't think i can update that for my macos 
we worked around it by assigning the result of the controller's method to a property  and doing ng repeat against it  i find it a little strange that ng repeat evaluates the collection portion of the expression more than once  i expected the collection to be evaluated once at the beginning  and i expected the result to be used in all the iterations of the ng repeat 
hey igor  i can reproduce pretty easily  i'm using eclipse  mac   as sanity check  i tried it on vim and that worked  i have seen eclipse sensitive to non ascii chars in the past  not sure how to remedy other than forewarning eclipse users and recommend using a regular text editor as a means to the end  which is something i do a lot these days  thanks   dan
well i have at least one other person in this thread who also thought it should work the way i do  as well as someone talking about ugly work arounds to make it work this way  i think our way should be supported  https   groups google com forum  fromgroups# topic angular 817hmpb8czg i find the currently supported sort of isolation scope to be pretty useless  it would be much more useful if it isolated the directive from the template  rather than isolating part of the template from the rest of the template 
unfortunately not  we've had to consider this not possible with angular projects that require ie8 support  on nov 7  2012 8 48 am  "evaneus" notifications github com wrote 
nvm it's already been fixed in master 
 davidjnelson this is the right context since all other directives do work absolutly fine  plus the compile service bootstraps the template 
i kept receiving a chrome aww snap  after finding out what an aww snap could be i was introduced to chromes profile and timeline tabs in the dev console  it showed the heap size growing as time passed and garbage collection wasn't able to remove all instances  i made sure there were no connections to objects etc and finally found that article  once i changed it to settimeout garbage collection was able to happen correctly  sorry for the lack of technical terms  i've only delved into this the last week  on 06 11 2012 1 13 pm  "igor minar" notifications github com wrote 
i always assumed event delegates must be faster and take less memory  i made some simple tests and it turns out my assumption was totally wrong  the performance of both event delegation and directly binded event handlers was almost exactly the same in my test  thanks for the quick response  i should have researched more before opening this issue 
thanks  i think i need some more information about how this works first  i opened a thread on so  http   stackoverflow com questions 13558989 angularjs resource and dollar sign in parameters further explanation would be helpful 
 pkozlowski opensource i'll do that  i also noticed that a 3xx response never comes in since the underlying xmlhttprequest transparently follows the redirect  so i ended up using a different response code 
 pkozlowski opensource i would expect there to be a facility similar to  exceptionhandler that would let me handle errors like this 
interesting   route object on next and current objects has controller  reloadonsearch and templateurl properties  next and current objects have params  pathparams  scope and  route  so they are not the same  in the plunker the app opens default route on the initial load  in  routechangestart i get  current   undefined   correct next   defined  default route  and doesn't have  route which i believe is incorrect  when i go to any other route  let's say i click on the "page 1" link in  routechangestart i get  current   defined  default route  and doesn't have  route which i believe is incorrect  next   defined  page route  and it does have the  route property which is correct so current and next objects in  routechangestart    do have the  route property if we are on a regular route   don't have the  route property if we are on a default route this behaviour is inconsistent  expected behaviour   route property is always present 
for invoking almost anything  i have yet to see an error thrown when the case doesn't match  or mismatch as it were  i'm creating a simple example now  edit  also  just to make sure i'm being understood  the problem is not that it doesn't work  that's expected  the problem is that no error at all is thrown when a user makes an error like that 
yes  i think it should go everywhere as long as there's an initial value in the ngmodel  on fri  nov 14  2014 at 2 07 pm  narretz notifications github com wrote 
of course  adding a scope variable is fine  but i'd much rather prefer do use the model itself to do this  i could just return  data  from my model  but then the following thing may happen    scope model getitems   0  x   5    while i would prefer to set data to it using setter methods  of course i control the whole application and i'll be careful not to do this  but it's just about the fact that returning the internal data through a get function automatically makes it susceptible to writing operations  i was only curious if there is a way around this  that's all 
the difference with  ng if  is that this will update when the expression changes 
would hope one could add  validator methods on a formcontroller  similar to ngmodelcontroller except that possibly no value would be passed  data would be brought in through services or a non isolated scope  to have a way of separating this logic from the controller  which could get bloated  run these checks when form changes and not on form submission or via explicit  scope  watch  and hook into  error to be able to show error messages  form level check are used to validate that information is congruent throughout the form    if a child has a birthdate that is earlier than the parent   dynamic list of people with relationships    if someone tries to make multiple withdrawals worth more than a maximum or more than what they stated they would withdraw   dynamic list of withdrawal slips   sum  
i needed to make it recompile everytime because the twitter library replaces the original template that i set inside my directive  i found that using   interpolate  and  ng bind html unsafe  made it work without the extra    watchers   since i'm manually watching the 'text' and 'element' scope variables  but thanks for the clarification  it made my experience with angularjs better   
it affects email and required fields
 pkozlowski opensource   i'm indeed talking about the  http requests that download partial html  the views content is dispatched among various html files in order to keep them tidy  and we'd like to know when all ng included views are loaded in order to reveal the page only by then  instead of seeing them add up one after the other when loading   http interceptors could be useful  but they are too broad for the use  we don't really want to intercept all http requests  only the ones requested by nginclude  hence the idea of catching some events notifying us that a new nginclude http request was made  incrementing a counter for each include  and decrementing it on  includecontentloaded  we could then assume that if the counter as reached 0 and stayed there for a certain amount of time  everything is loaded and we can reveal the whole page  i believe such an event would be useful in such circumstances and maybe others  but please let me know if there is another way to achieve the same goal 
 shepheb i will try to check  fastclick js  on weekends and post feedback 
oops  sorry  i get it now  everything is perfect 
yeah    i encoutered more than one strange buggy behaviour  in cases which worked just fine while testing it with pure css with  hover    but it's gonna take a while to extract it from the thing i'm working on   so yeah  eventually  just not now 
 emils " in this example  'few' is ambiguous in english  but serves as an example for other languages " so  in another language  such as polish  there could be a translation for "a few" items 
exactly my point  jquery behavior and angular jqlite are not equal  when you call  angular element input   triggerhandler "change"  somedataobject  and jquery input  triggerhandler "change"  somedataobject  jquery returns this object as onchange argument while angular completely ignores it  reason is as described in my first post concatenation between array and object 
http   plnkr co edit b6cipquyo4yytcavkoxv here it is  but i can't reproduce it on such a small scale  it could be related maybe to sliding 3d animations on switching between menu pages  i will try to enrich it with animations to get closer to what we have in our app  otherwise i can only send you link where to see it live  thou obfuscated  so no debugging would be possible  
 caitp the message in the block in not showed  there is a discuss here http   docs angularjs org api ng directive input number step to reproduce 1  add the validation for your input type "number" 2  type words 3  the message in  span    tags is not showed
i finally found out the issue  if i directly assign the returned data to  scope products  then there is no problem  but if i use jquery concat function  then the result is repeated one more time 
i don't see any glitching in your non angular example  so it is an angular problem  the doc comments for addclass in angular animate js say that  after the animation completes  angular first removes the  add and  add active classes  and then adds the unadorned class name  so there's a short window of time where the element doesn't have any classes  the comments even call this out explicitly as step 7   and that's probably where the glitch is coming from  is there any reason it does things in that order  it seems like it would make more sense to add the class first  and then remove the  add variants 
i haven't reproduced it with chrome and firefox  i haven't tested with other ones 
correct  it is not a bug  this is a request for comments concerns  on mon  sep 16  2013 at 3 13 pm  pete bacon darwin  notifications github com
for example eval    afaik ng csp mode prevents angular from using eval for ng    inline handlers  so it looks like csp mode isn't active 
hello  my use case is a bit strange  i have a mapping of  number  to  string    and as you can see  the comprehension permits filter chains  not just plain expressions  really nice  and another thing  i've noticed that  expression  is parsed as an  assignment   https   github com angular angular js blob master src ng parse js#l490 so the following function call expression  myfunction myvar   3   would also be valid  i don't know about you  but an assignment expression as a function argument seems "stranger" to me than a filter expression  i also found  filterchain  in  primary   which allows me to do  setvalue  value   int     https   github com angular angular js blob master src ng parse js#l601 so you can call a function with a filter expression if you really want to  but it's ugly  from my experience with top down recursive look ahead parsers  no other stuff would break with your proposed fix  i'm not a hundred percent sure  but i don't think the grammar would allow for any ambiguities that would break previously correct expressions  so  to sum it up  i know that my use case is strange  but i've shown that there are other "strange" use cases that are already possible  and i think there's no real danger of breaking existing code  so  if it's not too much trouble  please create a pull request with your proposed modification  if not  i could create one myself  but i've just created my github account and i'm pretty sure it would take me significantly more time to do so  thanks 
no  it interrupts the script and log to the console 
be happy to but there are a lot of moving parts  unless you want something specific i'll start with the actual page contents where the links do not work  before javascript is fetched and executed  https   gist github com pferrel 7073819 after javascript execution  https   gist github com pferrel 7073845 if you click   the link works but other non angular page links do not
 heikki yes  is that an issue 
for me it is the same in ie10 and ie11  result is empty  
hmm for example   anyway is that issue pr welcome 
this is something i have expected  however  in case the backend and the angular app are running on different domains subdomains ports such behaviour might be required  i am still able to make the calls by using   http defaults headers common "x csrftoken"   cookies 'csrftoken'    before each call  though it would be much nicer to be able to set it via  httpprovider 
good question    did not have time to look through the full cost of step through it   but the  http and  httpbackend code is not trivial sure to the coalescing of different caching and other cases into one code line    but google chrome and node server don't log see request when halting in debugger on  promise then i had hoped somebody could either tell me that i am definitely mistaken or it's by design somehow   that would speed up debugging      original message      from  "wawyed" notifications github com sent  ‎08 ‎09 ‎2014 17 32 to  "angular angular js" angular js noreply github com cc  "matthiasg" mgt576 gmail com subject  re   angular js   save resolves before network request  #8978  what is triggering the resolve if not a xhr response  — reply to this email directly or view it on github

 vojtajina that was almost it     it was angular js that was out of date  it turns out when bower installed angular growl  it did a resolution to angular 1 2 1  thanks 
 matsko i don't think it's an issue  seems to work fine now 
actually it seems like it is my fault since promise from one call is somehow returned in second call ie  i get stuff1 and then stuff2 and in stuff2 then i get stuff1 results  why is so   i guess that api def can hold only one promise result at a time  
in chrome  if there's a  min  or  max  attribute on an date input or  input type number    the native datepicker number picker widgets impose some restrictions  for example  if an  input type date   has a  min  attribute of  2015 01 01   you won't be able to select a date prior to 2015 01 01 in the calendar date picker 
 gkalpak i would expect clicking on a link to navigate to a new page  this does not happen  all that happens is that the location bar changes

i'm very pleased to see a fix for this in the works  is there any possibility this will end up in the 1 2 x branch  or is 1 2 26 going to be the final version of 1 2 with no future updates 
i have tried to do a fresh clone and build but "npm install" is choking on ""git   github com vojtajina " as i can't use "git" protocol from work  i replaced "git" with "https" in package json as well as "npm shrinkwrap json" but for some reason that failed as well  it appears as though this link to new git repo is added only today  i will have to try this at home where i will be able to use "git" protocol  if possible  i recommend changing the repo url to use https as "git" is more restrictive 
well it's a cordova app for android so in this case the browser wold be the stock android browser  by the way  the funny thing is th works just fine  using port 443 
it is failing with ie8  haven't checked other versions   pawel  i use resources for each webservice on my app  it would be inconsistent to use http for a few corner cases like this  but to me  the main problem here is the poor debbuging output  it would be more helpful to have angular clearly stating that you should not use primitive types because debbuging this under ie is a nightmare because it throws unhelpful messages "headers is undefined" 
definitely  i'll see what i can do  also  thanks for the workaround  i am doing something similar for the moment  thanks again
i don't think the core need these functionalities  i'd rather see it as a core's branch  something like angular js engine or angular js server 
i created an oo service that is instantiated in the controller  and passes the form in as one of the arguments  example

i'm trying to spy on a service method being called once something has happened in my controller  but every guide i have followed doesn't seem to work 
 narretz not sure what code i had since it changed  but it was with 1 3 14 i believe 
i would say that the order is not really important here  the nullification happens every time an event gets dispatched  and not during the library load   instead  i would suggest nulling those properties only when they fail the  hasownproperty  check  because   that   would cause a memory leak  not my event prototype based solution  
sure that wouldn't be a problem  when is good for you

i'm using chrome browser  and it's work fine in 1 2 x version   i don't understand what you don't understand  it's very simple  in version 1 2 x the 'active' changes effect on the ng class  inside the template  in the beggining     when the control is initialized   when the ng repeat apply on it   because this line   ng init "nav    nav activeindex   0"  only the first directive get the  active true  and become a purple and the rest  active false  and the got the black color  when you click on the directive it's become  active true  because this line  click "nav activeindex    index"   and everithing works fine    in 1 3 x    when the control is initialized and ng repeate apply on the directive   the  active  for all directive is   not true   and   not false    this is my problem  i don't know why  and therefore you see only white  because the template is without any background color   only when i click on it the  active  is updated and make the color changes  ostensibly this bug don't have any relation to ng animate  but if i   delete   the nganimate dependency everything work fine

i can't let angularjs creating my object implicitly  because  my ngmodel looks like this   it's an object inside an array  but angularjs is only able to construct an  object   if  phones  is missing  as can be seen on plnkr   this is also somewhat inconvenient and makes my back end break  if it looks like an array access it should construct an array  if necessary  i'd open an issue for that but i guess that would be a breaking change  thanks for your hints 
i'll try  but might be difficult due to i found it in a large enterprise app when i updated to 1 4 0 so i had to revert back to 1 3 15 again 
this issue is reported by our external tester  i will modify angular animate js with this logging and create special app version for him  we will hopefully get better info about related node 
 lgalfaso trying to create the plunkr i figured out the mistake which is not in angularjs    thank you anyway   
i tried to reproduce it in a simple scenario and i can't seem to  my app has many other directives and they just wouldn't render once i had this issue  if i ever find out  i'll update  thanks
it's hard to trigger browser autocomplete in a plnlr or similar
two ng if's  no server side load  no directive  inside each ng if has a list of object loading its ng repeat on a "ul" html list  but a very small list of items  just 3 to 5 items   when i use ng show  everything goes faster  but still more slowly then chrome  i am using material angular  using  angularjs v1 4 4 material angular v0 10 1
the problem occurred when changing the input type of the hour and minute field of the timepicker to number instead of text  maybe it has something to do with the model of those fields  however  it would make sense to have those fields as number inputs  what else could you put there      it also brings up the correct keyboard on phones and tablets 
what do you mean with 'behave like'  changing the parameters from length begin to start end as in slice  i just looked into the implementation and as the filter internally uses  slice  anyway there seems to be a bug in the calculation of the  end  param  when using a negative  start  parameter for slice  end  needs to be negative too or omitted  in my example above 5 and  5 result in  end  to equal 0 and  slice  returns an empty string 
sorry for being unclear  i believe it shouldn't throw an error for this case  i faced this issue when testing a custom directive  as i am adding messages from multiple files  i e multiple   div ng messages include "   "   div    i would like to test that they're added  and that they're added in the correct order  for the first case  just testing that messages are added from some custom sources   i just fill one of the sources with messages and leave the other ones empty  it's easy to workaround  i can just add   div   div   to the 'empty' sources   but i wonder if it should fail at all 
thanks for reply  i have created this plunker  http   plnkr co edit un9xbtrm1yqg4hubedza p preview currently the app is crashed  by removing 'ngmock' the app come back working as expected  what do you mean i shouldn't inject ngmock in my real app 
hello narretz  please find the demo on the plnkr  this web page needs to be viewed on the ios 8 phone mobile device  let me know if you need any info  thanks http   plnkr co edit slsoqq p info
it's just a minimalist example of the problem  an error thrown during a digest doesn't allow angular to know that it's no longer in a digest 
yes  good call  short version  instead of
yeah  sorry  i was looking for a way to just make this value available from the directive itself 
 keykrusher makes no sense  because i have the code divided into many different pieces  but i can try to explain what is happening  because i have custom directives like ng dropdown  i needed to connect angular form validation to the selected values  i only managed to make it working by adding hidden input with it's model and then calling  validate of this input field directly from dropdown on update callback
the specific usecase i'm looking at is a registration form with a username field  while the user is typing  it should be checked if the username is unique  of course we want to use a debounce here to not send a new request on every keystroke  while the debounce is timing out  however  we want the submit button to be disabled  since it cannot be guaranteed that the provided username will be unique  not disabling the button during this period results in a brief  300 ms  but real period of inconsistency  setting up an async validator to run the uniqueness check provides us with the   pending  property on the  ngmodel  we use this flag to disable the submit button  the debounce option doesn't provide any such way to signal it's state  however 
this bugs are very tricky  and as they are not often they can mess up some things very badly  i think that even impact on copy performance  deep copy doesn't have to be fast  right   it should be reliable 
thank you for your prompt message  i test with angular 1 3 20 and angular animate 1 3 20  and also with angular 1 4 8 and angular animate 1 4 8  unfortunately the same bad behavior occurs

i feel like an idiot  why i couldn't tell it was a function when it literally says 'function' beneith it  i do not know  all is fixed  non issue can be closed  thank you for your help  gkalpak 
 lgalfaso actually i did some more research in to this and the problem was most likely caused by my  rather complex   hacky  setup  i'm gonna close this so no one else spends time on this   
dynamically created directives as   body   childs  i use them in production as video holders  they can be closed and as they was added dynamically i must manually destroy element and his scope  on destroy i need to cleanup some external libs usage  so i use  ondestroy hook  also current behaviour is invalid due to discrepancy between same outside  logic     scope  on ' destroy'   and   ondestroy  perceived as equal things with equal behaviour 
tested with macbook pro   os x el capitan 10 11 3  15d21     firefox 45   throws "error  class constructors must be invoked with  new "   chrome 50    i am using beta channel  throws "typeerror  class constructor controller cannot be invoked without 'new'"   safari 9 0 3   throws "error  cannot call a class constructor" the injector has "isclass" method which returns false for native class  but  do bindings should work differently using "real" classes opposite to transformed to es5  if my application use this behavior to initialize controller properties  when i switch to native classes  it can stop working properly 
i don't need it in my app  i was just following the docs  https   docs angularjs org api ngmock i understand now that i load the library only during running tests  e g  via karma runner  right

 gkalpak yes  you are correct  seems to be a problem with some older versions of ipad only  i will close bug  thankyou 
indeed  the attached pr would break this behavior  personally  i would consider the fact that this behavior works now is more of a curiosity than a feature  especially so considering that  if transpiled   minified   under strictdi  the derived class will not be given the base class's  inject property and you'll have an app that works in dev but not in prod 
thx for the response  the concrete use case is writing a library in which we do not know the hashprefix set by the developer  config block of the application is done after the config block of the depending libraries   the library needs to interact with an embedding rich client  which has to set the route paths as full fragment for interaction with the spa  e x  #  page1 or in other applications # page1   as the hashprefix can differ  the library needs to calculate the full fragment from the url  the available routes are then communicated to the richt client so it can change the route via the browser path of the current application  thx 
ok  suppose we have two pages  let's name their profile and community    profile is located in http   example com profile and contain     sorry for my english 
your plnkr is an accurate representation of the issue  i'm passing an instance of imagedata  not canvas  to   state go   which eventually passes it to  copyrecurse   as does  angular copy   i also confirmed functional equivalence between your code and my code in chrome 57 and firefox 45  in both cases  chrome 57 throws the error  while firefox 45 does not throw any error  in fact  in firefox  the data appears to be fine too  more to the point  is  imagedata  a type that  angular copy  should be able to handle  i mean   copyelement  sets  needsrecurse   so in  some  cases  it returns a reference to the source  rather than trying to copy things like primitives and known immutables  but for some reason  that logic isn't extending to imagedata correctly in chrome 57 
will try later  thanks 
nah  that explanation works for me  i'll take it back to my bosses  👍
 narretz in our app we have a drop down to select country  based on country selection we display different information for that country  the information contains data for month drop down driven by country   by default we are initializing default month to show the default view  additionally on change of month we fetch data for selected month  now user changes country to see information of other country and again we are fetching new set of data including months but at this moment ng change handler of months automatically triggered by angular and this is the whole problem   by maintaining the same reference of months array its not triggering the ng change handler but this seems less obvious awkward solution 
i guess it is at compile linking time of the input  here is a test case    bug case zip  https   github com angular angular js files 2428150 bug case zip 
oh maybe this is just my poor memory  i thought i remembered chronotanks being able to chronoshift onto infantry because they were crushable  maybe i'm just thinking of the chronosphere

because then i would have to change all the weapons that already exist and add wall as a target  and that seemed klutzy  if someone had made a mod they would have to update their weapons to let them shoot at walls  guess it's a good thing no one plays cnc

cjshmyr  yes it is correct and not an error  but the  maybe  4 orca fs will not be build  when the fourth migis holded in the build qeue  in ra1 its also like this behavor  you can only build 3 migs when you have 3 airfields   
i remember when i was messing with the msam and mlrs thing being all ocd about it  i came across the same issues  i thougt the icon in bits was mean't to just plain override the original 
they might be a good scout if they were an early game unit but i'd build a helicopter before a chronotank any day 
well then the different versions would just pile up unless it uninstalled the old one too  but ok 
i dunno i cant get it to happen again either  maybe i was out of money for that moment or some shit

unfortunately not    i had not even thought about asking  not to mention  i had not a way to ask  is there coming a complete bug report system any time soon  such that would use a hash code for each game and when a crash occurs  hashcode so its easy to see which players played in the same game   the crash logs are automatically uploaded from all users at the next startup of openra   shouldnt be too hard to implement  and should speed up bug fixing too 
yeah that would be okay too  or simply automatically install it

 henrytheslav i was thinking about that  but wouldn't that be cpu intensive  you'd need to calculate the distance every time a unit makes a sound  also  where is the person listening located  if you take the center of the camera you might not hear your units getting attacked on the other side of the map  would be an interesting gameplay mechanic though   if every actor is listening  you have to calculate a lot more distances  or maybe have a second  smaller  invisible  "sound " shroud where units don't make the sound 
 pchote windows dpi setting is "standard size  96 dpi "   obrakmann where is the  settings yaml  file located  aha  i changed the window resolution to 800x600 and now the artifact is   gone    then i changed the _desktop resolution_ to 800x600 and restarted openra  the problem is back  so that fixed the issue while in window mode  the difference is that the entire window including borders did not fit inside the vertical desktop resolution  perhaps that was the cause    workaround   with the openra window resolution at 800x600  i then changed it to fullscreen and restarted  the  entire  issue is now resolved  also  since this workaround i was able to reproduce the issue in window mode by using an y resolution above screen height  but not any more in fullscreen mode  where i saw the black bar  that suddenly works as it should

well dogs aren't shooting something explosive so i don't know why they would cause an explosion  the same could be said for zombies ants too i guess  this was changed when grens were changed to always explode  i think the 20170523 release  it went unnoticed i guess 
no  only this  just stumbled over this     but i'm not 100  sure if the fix is ok and also may the old version is more faster cause there should be no actor twice     may we can break the recursion after finding the first match 
the user name has been edited out here for reporting purposes  and i did try to delete the logs and openra folders manually but the problem persists 
thak you  reaperrr  openra starting  but i have other problems with video  i open a new thread

well seen  i copy the game to my home directory   home paul  and it work there without the workaround copy of the directory 
thank you both  paul  i'm sorry i missed the latter part of your message in that issue about the compiling page  installing libsdl12 2 0 0 and libopenal1 fixed this  i will check to see if i have the rest of those packages  again  thank you guys for putting up with me xd
red alert allied campaign 06a has it as a secondary mission
mitchell  ok  i did a fresh pull and that didn't help  i did find why it wasn't working  apparently i have to set the project directory in the vagrant file  the value doesn't matter   config vm project_directory   " something" can you reproduce it by removing the project_directory setting 
sorry  i'll try to explain better  if you go into your vm directory and type "vagrant reload" in your terminal your vm will reload  right  but imagine if you go into your vm directory and ssh into your running vagrant machine to get an access to the shell  vagrant ssh command   there's no way i can run a vagrant ssh from there  that's what we are trying to do here at my job  let me know if u know something we could do   
it's consistent  tried 4 times in a row and got the same error  never saw it before upgrading to 0 6 3  i'm on mac os x 1 6 4   ruby 1 8 7  2009 06 12 patchlevel 174   universal darwin10 0 
me too  i saw this just once but it stuck really hard    only reboot of host solved this problem  after that i've never seen this again this package compiled successfully with the same parameters  
no  together with it  the 'knife bootstrap' way also doesn't let you run 'vagrant up' multiple times  which is also not handy  i'm currently more thinking into the direction of implementing an auto install of chef when the binary is not installed 
thanks for your answer  here is the vagrantifle included in the box 
is this released  maybe i need to update my gem  should have looked myself before i opened this issue    
i have tried this one on 2 different networks  in 2 different countries actually  norway and poland  so this doesn't look like dns hick up to me  i'll upgrade to latest virtualbox and report back 
thanks  i will try it tonight and get back 
yes i will revisit this when i've tried the new "lucid32" box  guest additions fix  tonight  maybe it's related

stack trace after "enabling host network   " 
it's showing up for me now that i'm building a ubuntu 11 10 box  but it wasn't when i was building a centos 5 7 box  not that it should matter  odd 
yeah  sure    here you go   thanks for looking into this  greets  oxy
my understanding is that the root account doesn't have a password  eg  it's locked   however the   vagrant   user has  vagrant  password  if you login as   vagrant    you could unlock the   root   account and give it whatever password you wanted using the following command   sudo passwd  u root

filed https   www virtualbox org ticket 11976 against virtualbox  hopefully this can get fixed   
 awole20 i need multiple settings for a single vm as described in the above scenario  in that case i need a base vagrantfile with no provisioning and two additional ones that contain provisioning settings  local and server   i would then merge one of them depending on my environment  on the road with no network connection  disabled provisioning   in the office with connection to puppet master  and in the special case that one will want to modify and test puppet configuration  a local puppet configuration  the goal is to increase code reusability 
here is the vagrant_log debug output  https   gist github com bartmeuris 71353db039334267a35e
i've  reported the issue upstream   net ssh net ssh issues 92   but the issue still remains in vagrant  i find that i can work around the issue by stopping my agent process  but that's far from ideal  perhaps there's something vagrant can do to work around the issue until it's resolved in net ssh  for example  since vagrant already has the key  it doesn't really need to use the agent at all  perhaps vagrant could disable agent support  at least for the management processes so it runs like it did in 1 0 
as you can't see other users vms with "vboxmanage list  xx " it seems that the solution is going to be hard to find  i see 2 options     add a flag  or config option  in vagrant to disable that cleanup  this could also be done at confirmation on the destroy dialog    remove the cleanup  probably not wanted 
yep  sorry for not doing it in the first place  https   gist github com thasmo 80755160f3f11686a987
hi  sethvargo i should have specified  i did a  vagrant plugins update   with vagrant telling me all plugins are up to date 
here is  https   gist github com krolow 914e88c9ad5b6940b8a4
yes  i ended up using veewee  then another script based on veewee  the issue was an incompatible ruby install 
this might be bad example  because you can probably override the puppet_server  or any other attribute  for that matter   what i'm ultimately trying to solve is in cases where some of my hosts should have a set of provisioners x  and another group of hosts with provisioners y  for example  i want some hosts to provision with some inline shell provisioners and puppet_server  while others might provision with different inline shell provisioners and a puppet manifest  or something different altogether  i'm currently digging through the code to see if there is way for me to get access to  and thus delete modify  the configuration objects for the individual vms  and maybe look at building a plugin or just some function to do what i want to do  but i was hoping this would be something that could be implemented in the core  easily  and thus be a bit cleaner to work with 
 tmatilai are you talking about   vagrant vmware fusion  
 sethvargo it actually does not break but the symbolic link does not work on linux guest  https   gist github com lmayorga1980 e4d2f05e97724a409862  vagrantfile  the following structure is a puppet module that installs ruby on different platforms and we use r10k to bring down third party dependencies    screen shot 2015 12 22 at 9 39 08 am  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3172378 11957461 e4524ad2 a88f 11e5 9637 971a774cabd1 png  it seems that it cannot find the ruby class   after vagrant ssh i could see that the symbolic link did not work within the vm    screen shot 2015 12 22 at 9 45 55 am  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3172378 11957633 d97ba7e2 a890 11e5 877e 21aed899774e png 
the issue happens only when i set the working_directory attribute either with   tmp   or  c  tmp  syntax 
1  create foo box file 2  run 'vagrant up' 3  run 'vagrant destroy' 4  update foo box file 5  run 'vagrant up'    at this point vagrant does not download unpack the update newer box file  it uses the cached version which is a pain if you are iterating on a box  it would be nice if there were a flag like   force download to update the cached version 
i found out that all i needed to do is use both the public and private keys i found here  https   github com mitchellh vagrant tree master keys it worked well after

here's a stderr log of a vagrant up command taken with vagrant_log debug  https   gist github com keunwoo 530e55bcb8663dfa5c38 the vagrantfile was prepared as follows  1  in an empty directory   vagrant init precise32 http   files vagrantup com precise32 box  2  edit the following line   config vm network  private_network  ip  "192 168 200 1"  3   export vagrant_log debug   i am using msysgit bash for my command shell   4   vagrant up 2 vagrant keunwoo 2013 07 29 1436 log  also  after further testing  i find that the defect is nondeterministic  or the behavior depends on some variable that i haven't controlled for  i have repeatedly tried the following procedure  1   vagrant destroy  2   rm  rf  vagrant  3  edit the ip address in the vagrantfile  4   vagrant up  i don't change anything else in between runs  i observe the following outcomes  a  sometimes the host interface's ip is set to a different ip on the same subnet as the guest ip  this is clearly the desired behavior  b  sometimes the host interface's ip is set to the same ip as the guest ip  as reported in the original ticket  c  sometimes the host interface's ip is set to an ip on a different subnet from the guest  this is no better than  2  as the guest will still be unreachable from the host  it is possible that  b  and  c  occur more often when the final component of the configured ip address is 1  there may also be some hysteresis  sometimes when i get outcome  c   the bad ip address is the host ip address from the previous  destroyed  vm  when i get some time  i may experiment more to try to isolate the cause between  a    b   and  c   for now  i would advise anyone who encounters issues like this to manually edit the host interface's ip address as a workaround 
i did it in command prompt 
sure  here's the relevant portion of my vagrantfile   as you can see  the only parameters i'm actually passing to the  get_url  module are  url  and  dest   yet ansible complains that i'm passing the  couchdb_bind_address  as a _parameter_  kind of weird  as i said earlier  my playbook works fine with vagrant 1 2 7 
i did it  output follows  note  the machine went into "guru meditation" mode  after the vagrant up failed   provider virtualbox  that probably cause the second error  cant unlock or do something with it in virtualbox  i have to reboot the system 
i deleted all folder  vagrant and it didnt help  this is my vagrant file 
doesn't deliver a log file  i assume it's meant to be in the same directory as the vagrant file  on 8 january 2014 16 42  mitchell hashimoto notifications github comwrote 
sure  you're suggesting a different host machine running a different installation of vagrant  let me see what i can gather on this 
thanks for the quick response  your given keywords helped me to solve it with some googling  sadly i did not know what exactly caused it to work  but what i tried is   tried  vagrant share  after that again and   it works        i removed   etc ssl certs vagrantshare pem  and executed  sudo c_rehash  etc ssl certs   again  so i got the state i had before  when it was not working  but surprisingly  vagrant share  still works  so i really don't have clue what did the trick in the end   however  thank you and keep on the great work guys 
sorry i don't understand the question    i'm trying to understand the vagrant code in the docker provisioner  the part where it tries to determine if docker is available on the vm  it seems to think that docker isn't installed 
i saw a couple behaviors  first  one user had a directory several levels under is home  then had a "projects" library  when under this directory  the machine hangs at boot  the debug log showed it repeatedly trying to ssh to the guest  and failing  moving the vagrantfile to another directory solved the issue  second  the vagrant file was in a directory  and it worked find  however  when that directory was added to the "documents" library  and accessed that way  it could not be deleted without being first moved  with a series of 'permission denied' errors when a vagrant destroy was issued 
yep  that's it  embarrassed i didn't find that it via github search   disappointed 
1  make sure your base box is not installed 2  set box_url in vagrantfile 3  use vagrant berkshelf with chef solo to provision vm 4  vagrant up  which downloads the box and builds the vm in one execution  in 9 out of 10 cases it didn't mount the cookbooks shared folder for me  however  when the base box is installed  everything seems to work fine

whats the location for the debug log 
crap  i meant virtualbox  not vagrant  sorry  just from the virtualbox menu   virtualbox check for updates
it just happens with my boxes  not sure which exactly actions cause this  but here is debug log  https   gist github com mkuzmin 1670b4550d42557e8c62
i'll try and get to this as soon as i can  have a few pressing commitments to finish up before i can install uninstall plugins
vagrant  1 6 5 vagrant vmware workstation  3 0 1 vmware workstation  10 0 3 build 1895310
i will  i assumed that the "www getchef com" was coming from vagrant  thanks again for being so responsive 
you can see the spelling is correct above from the ls output  here is ls  l showing the permissions  vagrant is being executed by the alterian user  ls  l   boxes centos 6 5 400 box  rw rw r   1 alterian alterian 377446400 nov 5 02 47   boxes centos 6 5 400 box
yep 
restart does not help  i tried it few times  workaround for this problem is to change configuration of the default virtualbox host only ethernet adapter to have   in this case  vagrant matches default adapter as applicable for work and so use it instead of creating new one 
if the docs had shown their version today  i _could_ have noticed a discrepancy between the version i'm using  1 7 2  and the version of the docs  post 1 7 2   i understand that this is normally not necessary  but it helps prevent confusion in case of error 
yeah  i found it in  opt  for some reason my find wasn't finding 
seemed to work  thanks 
hi  sethvargo  thanks first for your answer  it's very appreciated  here is my gist   https   gist github com coolfarmer 8f9f17a8b35a59a75a2c i don't have found the solution  i hope you can tell me anything i don't already see on google    
 sethvargo yes  you are right   vagrant is the default shared folder  i didn't found any document told me that can't compile in shared dir  e g  when i compile libmcrypt  when i make   thank u very much for your help 
tomcat that contains app war  but i want to be able to mount my war from windows   so from containers perspective no change but from content we have new war  i need to ability to remove container and run again with new compiled war sent from my samsung device          original message          from  seth vargo notifications github com date  06 08 2015 22 58  gmt+02 00  to  mitchellh vagrant vagrant noreply github com cc  defender adam spektor gmail com subject  re   vagrant  add remove api to config vm provision type  "docker"  #6062  hi  defender thank you for opening an issue  what kind of containers are you running that need to change on each iteration  — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
what if you have multiple boxes  why did vagrant ssh work to each of them  on wed  may 20  2015  06 32 seth vargo notifications github com wrote 
this is working now 
imho  it is not  it appears that his need was starting n of xyz whereas this matches with the basic philosophy of  "once you or someone else creates a single vagrantfile  you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work " where the entire system is upped in the sequence required  the difference between this concept and that of the current implementation is that now we would have to disable parallel booting in order to satisfy dependencies so long as we add the vms in the order required  my suggestion would allow vagrant to determine which vms would need booted in what order and allow parallel booting when possible 
host is ubuntu 14 04 with a 3 19 kernel  i didn't want to use vagrant 1 7 4 and vbox 5 0 because of an issue with nfs  #4476  it is good to know that it is not happening with those versions  maybe i change my approach  use rsync for instance or install guest additions manually and make an image   my vagrantfile is https   gist github com hectorcanto 14d34d59f23da84ce1fd the gist has a excerpt of the prompt  i won't debug it today  maybe tomorrok  thanks for your help 
i'm trying to use vagrant to test my ansible configstack  so terraform isn't an alternative here  i will try to reproduce this without using ansible   provisioning  currently i guess it's a virtualbox networking issue

thanks for reply and running the test  i've upgraded vagrant to v1 7 4 and virtualbox to v5 0 0r101573 and it's still the same  it actually hangs at the same point that you provided the last line   is your script actually finishes the execution  which means going back to the shell prompt  which i believe it should   or it's expected behaviour that the ruby process is in endless _waiting_ state 
 sethvargo sure  where can i see how to run in debug mode 
thanks loiclavoie  i'm a little confused  i have virtualbox 5 on my computer  on which i installed centos 6 4 am i supposed to install virtualbox again on the centos  sorry for this n00b question
ok   i will do
yes   i have admin privileges  chef client is 12 5 1
if it is not installed by default  then no  trying these commands produce error messages   vagrant box add hashicorp precise64  this command was not invoked properly   vagrant box add hashicorp precise64 https   atlas hashicorp com hashicorp boxes precise64  the box failed to unpackage properly  please verify that the box file you're trying to add is not corrupted and try again  the output from attempting to unpackage  if any   bsdtar  error opening archive  unrecognized archive format
hi  sethvargo   thank you for the welcome message    i installed vagrant with the ubuntu package manager  apt get install  y vagrant'  but it seems that the version of vagrant that comes with it is very old  so  to fix this issue i installed the latest version of vagrant via the  deb file provided in the vagrant's download page 
hi  the vagrant file is at https   gist github com csogilvie 24fa3915ba3c012eaa49 note that this has a block for aws in it as well  but this is   not   being used in this case 
 sethvargo i also tried that but i am getting the same error 
not sure what other information i can provide   i run the exact same commands as you and  ssh  simply hangs  i suspect this is because of the virtualbox network not being brought up or routed  what's the output from your  ip addr  and  ip route  on the host system  and just to double check  you are also using debian 9 on the host system  right 
vagrant file   only after that did i get the error in the issue
okay  but "just works" implies that vagrant should do the same thing in most circumstances  if i run vagrant halt  my environment should halt and stop using resources  also  we don't use boot2docker  we use coreos for the docker host machine  and while that's still a relatively low resource vm  i still don't want it running in the background all the time  if i open a pr to stop the docket host machine after vagrant halt finishes  possibly with an environment variable to opt out of that   would it be accepted  i've got most of the code working as a plugin already and there's not a lot to it 
https   github com mitchellh vagrant aws issues 444 done
the problem was with plugin  removed the vagrant digitalocean plugin  0 7 10  and worked  thank you   
here are my steps  windows 7 x64    installed a version some months ago  deleted the installation kit from the download dir  last week decided to upgrade  so downloaded the latest installation kit  started the installation  it detected there's an older install and asked for the old installation kit  the one downloaded a while back  try yourself the upgrade but first remove the old kit  maybe it's a problem of the old kit  now fixed 
 sethvargo i can confirm this does not happen if vagrant berkshelf plugin is removed  so is it chef or vagrant that is now confused about where to get home made cookbooks 
 sethvargo that does make sense  but having a variety of exit codes is not unheard of  eg  nagios checks  i don't think exit codes and human readable output should be conflated  or that exit codes should be abandoned altogether  if we are going to require parsing of string output instead of relying on exit codes then we should have a machine readable status like    json

hi  sethvargo  thanks for the quick reply  config ssh pty   true did not help  testing that out did get me thinking about alternate ways to achieve the same aim  in my use case  i only need to   skip once something in provisioning has failed in order to troubleshoot  we use the hostmanager plugin and we have an inventory file  so it becomes a simple matter of running ansible playbook outside of vagrant e g   ansible playbook  i inventorydir playbook yml   step  u vagrant   ask pass  so  now that i understand that interactive provisioning is not supported by vagrant and i have a workaround  i'll go ahead and close this issue  thanks again   david

i think i can do that but how can i run this test  can you give me a hint on how to run this test  thanks 
good catch  chrisroberts  my mistake  i reran after correcting the vagrantfile and    of course   it works without any issues  updated the  log file  https   gist github com mbbroberg 1af0b8c0634bcd1944f74b15cd6a1d64   closing now that i can't reproduce it 
i cannot use vagrant at all  either my machine freezes  or i receive this error    vagrant up  also freezes anytime i am creating a vm from a vagrantfile
works with 2 0 3  thanks  which commit fixed the issue

thank you  briancain for your attempt on reproducing my issue  unfortunately  the issue persists on my setup with the correct quoting  both with  "  and  '    maybe i'm the only one struggling with this issue  i created a  gist  https   gist github com szamuboy fbcadfb79d7ad1abea1137a3269a1bda  that shows the issue in more detail 
nope  i have 3 vms  the problem is with one  i didnt change anything in the vm os settings  ubuntu 16 04  since last proper start and it suddenly doesnt want to start nicely  i've already attached the details up above  i've originally created it using this tool  https   puphpet com  i've put all these files here  https   drive google com drive folders 1nstu4c6brancfwlxber4bvobefz kt2t usp sharing what's more interesning  when i copied this config  change vm name and shared files destination and created vm from scratch everything worked well and the new vm starts properly

does this happen every time you bring up a guest    yes  do you have any other machines or instances of vagrant running    no  have you tried running vagrant outside of wsl  like in powershell    i tried running with windows 64 bit version of vagrant but there was different error output when vagrant tried to ssh to the guest machine      default  importing base box 'centos 7'        default  matching mac address for nat networking        default  checking if box 'centos 7' version '1902 01' is up to date        default  setting the name of the vm  set_default_1560395951567_31314     default  clearing any previously set network interfaces        default  preparing network interfaces based on configuration    default  adapter 1  nat     default  forwarding ports    default  22  guest     2222  host   adapter 1      default  booting vm        default  waiting for machine to boot  this may take a few minutes    default  ssh address  127 0 0 1 2222 default  ssh username  vagrant default  ssh auth method  private key timed out while waiting for the machine to boot  this means that vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within the configured  "config vm boot_timeout" value  time period  br   if you look above  you should be able to see the error s  that vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine  these errors are usually good hints as to what may be wrong  br   if you're using a custom box  make sure that networking is properly working and you're able to connect to the machine  it is a common problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes  verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly  as well  br   if the box appears to be booting properly  you may want to increase the timeout  "config vm boot_timeout"  value  debug output https   1drv ms u s alvgho4ejwrwk0ivymnme5fhmvgk

it looks like this was the result of a restore from an automated backup where artifacts were included for some reason  wiped them out running uninstall through the 2 2 6 msi and it ran cleanly 
on mint 17 1  gcc version  ubuntu 4 8 2 19ubuntu1  4 8 2  i run it as   edit  actually i just tested with onlysafecode   false as well as onlysafecode   true  same result in both instances  not sure how it worked for def  
 fowlmouth it does   varriount the idea is to generate an error with a message containing all the symbols that have neither been referenced nor excluded  this simplifies the task of making sure that a wrapper is up to date with the associated bindings 
i would be satisfied if it just displayed error and refused to compile the "continue" statement on such fake loops where it is not implemented 
graphic pipeline which takes a set of transformation matrices  if you know them all in advance you can avoid runtime calculation of result matrix  possibly a database transaction executing several sql commands  if you know all of these commands in advance you may check their validity against the database during compile time  mixing of compile time and runtime parameters looks like a problem 
error was at this line    yamltag t   returns a tagid while the other option returns a  string  
no  see my above example  it works with the c back end  i named it writefile nim because that is what i was having issues with  but again  now with a different file name  same results 
darn  it did work  actually  i've been using 0 dimensional arrays for the past couple months  then pulled the latest  devel  branch hoping it would fix some obscure code generation bug i was experiencing  a couple months ago i switched from using tuples to arrays to represent n dimensional tensor indices  using tuples required a lot more code generation  making the switch let me compile my test suite in  0 3 seconds instead of  10 seconds   it would be great if this could be supported at some point  0 d arrays come up      when scalars interact with tensors  e g  via  promotion broadcasting  http   docs scipy org doc numpy user basics broadcasting html      in the base cases of operations defined recursively on arbitrary rank tensors  e g  printing  folds reductions  index transformations   though i understand the "low priority" tag given that the manual doesn't actually say this should work    
i don't know  but i think when setposition   is available  something like cut   should be possible also  at least i needed a cut operation for a string stream recently  but indeed maybe using just a plain string would have been the better solution  i used string stream  because i saw some people using it  one of these was jason m  for his smart gi work  and i think that i should better not admit that i had some trouble understanding the streams manual at all    for example when flush   is necessary  or if first closing the stream and then writing string to file  or first writing to file and closing finally 
edit from varriount  error output is here  https   gist github com varriount 7b80f292b21a8d5de7bb
still occurs with the revision you specified 
 def   yes  i should have mentioned that it simply depends on whether a subthread terminates before the main thread  if the subthread runs indefinitely  everything is fine 
i tried to find it  but even this is tough     the exact example i have given also seems to fail with fairly old versions of nim  i have some other variants of this failure  i'll have to see if i can bisect them  maybe it isn't a regression after all  and i just happened to run into it much more often now   
can be reproduced on devel  git hash  5334fd453317fef04ea929fe4a4f4f2e0f6f5dbb make sure you use c++ backend   nim cpp  r    and  as an additional detail  i use macos and  clang++  to compile the generated code 
of my msgpack nim library   https   github com akiradeveloper msgpack nim  the latest 6e0d873f275af0469b868747946ba012ff111c2f is broken when we run  make quickcheck   the task first generates random test cases and feeds them to msgpack library  so whether it fails or not depends on the randomness  i narrowed down the problem and which i showed above is the minimum case to reproduce the problem  this problem didn't appear at mar 25  so some degradation can be suspected  since  f       is accepted by the compiler there is no way the third case  g  0         isn't 
this is when building the example server  that contains all the features  the same happens when building a smaller application   nimble todo    i have not been able to isolate where the failure comes from yet  both examples can be tried by cloning the repo and running  nimble server  or  nimble todo  respectively 
i will try on monday
version 5 3 0
as a quick fix on my code i am doing this   not the pest idea as it uses exceptions as part of the work flow  there is also the  memfiles  http   nim lang org docs memfiles html  but i did not have the chance play with it yet 
here you go    2015 06 19 14 55 34  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7340772 8261034 6aff0f4e 1695 11e5 83f9 7a59bce6454c png 
well it cannot be old  since i installed the freebsd vm yestarday and built nim from source  i will try to reproduce it with a simpler example  however the problem comes with the cpp compilation  so i don't get whats the matter with c arguments   varriount 
i don't think the referenced issue has any more details about this issue   define private public  the  still unreported as of now  os x issue is unrelated 
i was linking initially this can be a feature of distinct but on second thoughts it is better as part of effect to track units and measures 
i thinks the best would be to see what other languages to and adopt it to nim  https   en wikipedia org wiki aspect oriented_programming  https   en wikipedia org w index php title feature oriented_programming redirect no in the case of nim it is best to implement them through extending the macro and template feature 
 let  produces the same error as  var   both inside and outside the parallel block   const  changes the error to a disjoint error   1    1  not disjoint from  1    1   
apologies  i forgot to mention this is only with the  cpp  backend  the  c  backend works fine  unfortunately  my project depends on the cpp backend due to various external dependencies  i verified this to still be present with #head  1 3 1  and the cpp backend in use 
i use nim 0 11 2  and want to write a app to parse command line args  so i use docopt lib  but when i compile the source   i get the error error  redefinition of 'util'  so   i turn to use nim on github   the devel branch  and the error gone  i dont know why  please close this issue 
the point   a larger subset of nim stdlib and ecosystem being usable in environments where gc is not acceptable  eg  domains where only c  c++  rust or ada may be used  it would be like "  gc none" that always becomes a compile error if a given function has that pragma  but you're right  given that "  gc none" is available  it's a lot less relevant  people can make github pull requests  or make their own modules where "  gc none" doesn't give any warnings  for those kinds of environments  thanks for the reminder 
 araq could you please elaborate  i'm not sure i understand what you're referring to  are you referring to this line in  produceproc    my guess is the   n  creates a thread local string that then tries to get processed in  consumeproc   causing the thing to fail  or did you manage to spot something else  i have to tell  errors like this are super easy to make  just like in c   and this makes nim quite error prone and hard to use correctly in multithreaded scenarios  unfortunately 
well  nim has object inheritance  and being able to make a copy of an object is one of the more basic things you could hope to do in a system with object inheritance  if nim is going to have barriers to basic uses of object inheritance maybe it should not have included the feature    edit  it has been explained to me that you can just do this with deepcopy  so apparently the language does support this  oops 
yes  the header files are installed   sfml is installed via  doas pkg_add sfml   this test is also disabled on freebsd for similar reasons  and is also disabled on windows 
 andreaferretti  the thing is  it's not even ambiguous in the test case 
linux works on windows
say i want to support asciidoc nim doc comments  or github markdown  or something else  all start from plain text  code already exists to parse and format from that  and the structure captured in the html is not the structure i want  i think it would be cool to write some code that generates the complete documentation for a project including the index  i have some ideas that might make it better than what's currently available  to do that i need more control over the formatting and i would like to work in plain text  as written in the source  until the end when it gets converted to one or more final output formats 
 andreaferretti the output loses the backticks around    which causes a weird parsing error  separately  it isn't usable for this specific purpose because it automatically imports all of the current module  but i think there is a general issue with its handling of backticks 
 dom96 yes  in terminal works fine  i think it must be moved to vscode   here  https   github com pragmagic vscode nim issues 85  is another issue for std io and vscode 
i followed https   nim lang org install_unix html  i installed gcc via yum  y install gcc before hand  i though nim was interesting and wanted to give it a try  please don't allow a failure on such simple task make a bad taste of nim  if there is a way to produce more informative message  let me know  thanks
have you ever used matlab c shared libray and mex functions  making matlab extentions will become easy with nim mex tool and grnerated matlab code can ve used in nim applications 
i can step over c# code from f# 
yes  the issue was i hadn't done  nim c koch  in a while  it works now  thanks 
should just be a static block  i believe if i understand you correctly  e g of usage   i'll try at some point today build install latest nim manually and see if i can get any different results if i missed something 
why would that be a problem 
no  i mean a predict function  for example  if you want to draw the segmented space  http   en wikipedia org wiki file k_means_example_step_4 svg
let's bump our lowest supported version of matplotlib  matplotlib 1 5 1 is too old  y'all never thought that you'd hear that from me  right  
i've added a pr  here  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 1345    gaelvaroquaux  i've checked out the very latest version of the code and the problem is still there  so i think my pull request is still valid  i've looked over it now  and it seems that the code for precision and recall were recently updated  as well as the code for auc   but not the implementation of  precision_recall_curve   is that right  the change i made applies to  precision_recall_curve  only  i also added a test based on the example above 
so far it seems to have solved my issues  because we have had a few unsuccessful attempts to solve this  i want to do more testing before saying i am happy  but my intuition is that this problem has been fixed 
0 16 1  has 0 16 2 been released  
i still get it with the newest numpy and scikit  happened on the first  make  during nosetests  and then i had to run it several hundred times to have it happen again   um  i'll try to debug it more 
upgraded cython  0 19 1 is the latest released cython    anyway  i tried with cython from git and it still fails 
import numpy as np from sklearn import metrics y   np array  false  false  true  true   scores   np array  0 1  0 4  0 35  0 8   fpr  tpr  thresholds   metrics roc_curve y  scores  print thresholds  " n"  tpr now calculate the tpr for the thresholds  tpr_correct      for t in range len thresholds    tp   numpy sum  scores    thresholds t     y  p   numpy sum y  tpr_correct append 1 0    tp   p  print tpr_correct the script shows that an easy fix is just to reverse the thresholds array 
i'll have a closer look later  currently i've got the following evidence  1   y  changes at  this line  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob 733629d256abaf9a31d6e6305f859768432907ed sklearn ensemble forest py#l222   what goes into the  _validate_y_class_weight  is  it is again the first 10 labels that are predicted correctly  and all others are predicted as the second label  with  y    ch for ch in 'bbbdefghijklmnopqrstu'  classes     i get a bunch of  d s at the end of the array 
that’s exactly right  one of the utility classes in skll was writing out dicts with zeros  computed from an array using  todense     and we assumed   based on past behavior   that dictvectorizer would do the “right” thing there and give us a sparse array 
i used the windows installation from sourceforge  http   sourceforge net projects scikit learn files   the version i chose was "scikit learn 0 13 win32 py2 7 exe" though my windows version is 64 bit  my python version was 32 bit  so i guess i was supposed to install scikit 32 bit version  thank you so much for your prompt reply 
yes it ran    successfully   
i think it is the issue  i was unaware what numpy was  thanks a lot 
i want to use it in the final step of a pipeline with other steps needing  y  for training  the small patch above seems to do this fine  since number and mean of labeled clusters is known by training   now that i think about it  transform  also can be a valuable component for gmm 
the default behavior in matlab and r is to give the sample stdev var cov with dof n 1 the default behavior in numpy is to give the population stdev var cov with dof n the cov functions in scikit are always with n and do not have an n 1 option the fast_mcd paper  http   www geo upm es postgrado carloslopez papers fastalgmcd99 pdf  seems to use n in the determinant evaluation and n 1 in the reweighting 
 lesteve my apologies  the reason i uploaded a pickle is because the error wasn't deterministic  it was discovered while writing tests for the mice pr   x  was generated with  and then split into  xtr    xts    y  inside of mice   this  https   github com sergeyf scikit learn blob a8dcdbf815c6b65a559bdecc7bfd267b61f2c5fa sklearn preprocessing tests test_imputation py#l441  test was failing only sometimes  maybe 1 out of 10 times  when  ardregression  was added alongside the other two regressors  it would be quite tricky to make self contained code to get it exactly because i'd have to gut the mice internals to do so  and stick it in a while loop  is it possible to use a safer file format  perhaps if i saved a zip of csvs 
it doesn't work  the problem seems to be in  scipy misc imread   it returns this   which is not was is expected  e g  a numpy array 
the example below will throw the error i mentioned  i tried it with bernouliinb and gaussiannb   for the last line and get the same results  this seems to be a simple case of unadjusted string formatting

 oiah i re install the whole python package and it works now  maybe there are some mismatch or mistakes when you modify the code just try to re install packages and compile seq_dataset pyx before any modification of it 
they are a useful output if you want to present the results to a non technical audience and don’t want to explain entropy    
i've observed this only for the dense case 
hi amuller  this is not related to the random seed or the random data  it reproduces every time  for me   regardless to what is plotted or what the data is  my original code uses fixed random state and data generation is much more complicated   here is a deterministic version of the code

i just tried to install anaconda on a fresh vm and did all of my install as sudo using only conda and everything worked fine this time  and i could correct my installation   i think i used pip back then  thank you
i will try to get a minimal working example  although i find it difficult as i see no pattern yet  that is  the experiments for which it does work and it doesn't work look similar to me  
 amueller i cannot install 0 17 because of #5904
indeed  the main issue is that given two trees with only  min_weight_fraction_leaf  and  min_samples_split   the two trees grow differently because there are times where  n_node_samples   2 min_samples_leaf  but  weighted_n_node_samples is not   min_weight_leaf   this is in contrary to the idea that they should give equivalent results in certain cases

hi  fayeshine thank you very much for your reply  the training time of r and python should be a little long  24 hours or shorter than that in r or in python  sorry i could not really remember the exact number   there are over 10 thousand different combinations of hyper paramters values  btw  all r python codes are available at https   github com xueyan2015 python_r      fayeshine commented 2 days ago this may need a comparison on the implementation code  even the blas library may give different results  however  can i ask the training time of r and python 
yeah  it's a large df  hundreds of columns  with two dtypes   strings  and  floats   the first stage of the pipeline takes care of one hot encoding the strings  and then attaches it back to the original df  the numpy array that is passed to the last stage of the pipeline is pure  float64 s  the pipeline itself seems to be okay as the  fit    predict  and  predict_proba  methods work fine on my input dfs  it's only when i pass the pipeline as the  estimator  argument in  rfecv  that i get the above error  one caveat is that in my custom transformer  i haven't implemented  get_params    and  set_params     could this be causing the error 
if line 816 is wrong  then  line 815  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob 706b45e03e0a4e8aae08560853eba7b6c4853b5b sklearn manifold t_sne py#l815  probably should be changed as well  seems like  min_grad_norm  is also not working 
hello  thanks for replying  this is for dev and contribution  1  i downloaded from git into a folder scikit_learn 2  i followed all the hacks top distutil to put vc compiler for python 2 7 in the path    i checked with scikit build from appveyor logs   the differences comes  compile was done in command line from this folder  cd  _devs python01 project27 scikit_learn sklearn2 python setup py build build_ext   inplace   compiler msvc   it seems that the build "string" did not copy and paste this part   'sklearn _'  would you get an idea in which file the compile string is built  so i can check why this string has issues 
thanks a lot to lesteve and chaitya62  it works well 。

hi  please try the following code 
i guess it's the only way to do it  note that i have no idea how this mloss org works  i was just pointing out the outdated link  thanks for responding 
 tomdlt  tguillemot correct me if i'm wrong  i don't think the following will work 
the ovr method is just to make a stand alone example  my real use case is to use one hot labels with neural networks  but i wanted to give a simple example using only scikit learn  feel free to add a better toy example 
 lesteve can you please also specify what needs to be done for precision  or should that be as is 
instead of having cross validaton error as a function of training example to have it as a function of number of trees  sorry for not specifying this  the idea is that the number of trees are an important parameter in a random forrest regresion  it is insidefull to be able to see the classification error as a function of the number of trees to see if one needs more trees or needs to preform early stopping  to me it seems somehow less important to see the cross validation results as function of the number of training samples  since that is not often a hyperparameter i can choose 
my_pipeline   1  transform   would be great yes  it would probably need examples because    1  is hard to google  regarding feature description  currently i am using  this code  https   github com mratsim machinelearning_kaggle blob master kaggle 20  20001 20  20titanic 20survivors kaggle 001 python magicalforest py#l526  to get feature description + ranking by tree ensembles  it walks through all transformations in a pipeline  the main issue is inconsistency between  onehotencoder   active_features_  and  labelbinarizer   classes_  at least  furthermore for n category features  labelbinarizer  return n columns except if there are 2  it returns 1 column only which tripped me and others edit  this should probably be discussed in another thread  also you probably referenced the wrong issue  2013 
the reason why i did one hot encoding first is exactly because of #6967  and the fact that i had nans in both categorical and numeric features  it did not occur to me  that i can first remove nans in the categorical features  then apply the imputer  and finally the one hot encoder  it's a bit convoluted  but it works  i might try to submit a pull request myself in the next few days  if you think this is easy enough for a beginner in scikit 
i will open a pr with the improvements of the doc  i investigated the code a bit more  i think that when  output_distribution 'uniform'  the statement  l2250  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob cd8fe16 sklearn preprocessing data py#l2250   is not needed as for a uniform distribution on  0  1  the quantile function  ppf  is the identity function  in this case the implementation would just compute the empirical cdf which would correspond to what i think it should be doing  unless there was a reason to use  ppf  even for the uniform output  cc  glemaitre  ogrisel ps  i also had a look at the  quantiletransformer  pr  this is impressive work 
fixed  personal experience is that instead of install all required library one by one  install them in a bundle such as anaconda is easier 
given that you contributed the most  i will let you have the honor     
 gaelvaroquaux yup  it only occurs with n_jobs   1  fixing the errors with the invalid y does not change it  however  the scoring fixed it  had missed that i hadn't updated the scoring   jnothman thanks for that  this was the issue  not entirely sure why this brought out the issue though 
 nicolashug that only fixes the problem half way  setting  labels   resolves the "not enough classes out of fold" case  but the "not enough classes in fold" case is still a problem 
the sklearn __version__ is 0 19 1
sure  am at work but can tackle it this afternoon  will write accompanying test
i stumbled upon it myself with some data but by preprocessing i got the result i needed  i was just confused by if it for a while  but as mentioned maybe i should look into improving the documentation
my dataset is private  besides  it weighs several gigabytes  furthermore  i don't think examining the dataset is going to enlighten you all that much  especially as i have recently noticed that changing the hyperparameters can sometimes cause the error to appear on a dataset that previously allowed training with no problem  based on  jnothman's observation i have added  if len terminal_region     0  return  after line 385   terminal_region   np where terminal_regions    leaf  0   of       sklearn ensemble gradient_boosting py#l385   https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob master sklearn ensemble gradient_boosting py#l385  i confirm that with this change i can train the model on my dataset without any errors  if i undo the modification then  as before  model fit throws the above error 
 jnothman i can only offer a simple fix for this problem  since this is a small mistake if i'm right  maybe you can just accept my patch or take it as a reference 
https   gist github com chriskamphuis bd261c02ec79ae045ff8b8bac2fc8d41 the data is actually 130k lines  however i included the first few hunderd  i found that when using this data the results do in fact actually differ  however using the total dataset it does not  the whole dataset is downloaded here  https   www kaggle com zynicide wine reviews downloads winemag data 130k v2 csv 4
i don't know what it is other than an observation  i found the memory leak thread first  but then realized it could be more things  that's right  n_jobs 1 does not have an issue 
absolutely   not on master however    currently i put it in #11950 for now because there was no use elsewhere yet  but i can make a separate pr for that  it's adapted from some code of loky  essentially loop over dynamically shared libs to check which blas   openmp is loaded and then use the appropriate method to dynamically set the max number of threads they are allowed to use 
 fit  sets  daal_model_  attributes storing library objects representing solution   estimators_  is a property  that constructs the list of  sklearn tree decisiontreeclassifier  objects  reconstructed from  daal_model_   the reconstruction is expensive  so i am caching the result in  _cached_estimators_   the question really is why does  predict  call  estimators_  property code  it turns out this was happening during the call  because that explicitly accesses  estimators_   so i suppose i should not be calling this method 
 rth sorry  i can't download all the dataset  it's to large as well as forbidden  but i can run code on it for anything you need  my code is something like this   i can get the correct answer  plz tell me anything you need  i will run the code for you  thanks very much 
my use case for the repr is pretty niche  but i felt a sk set_printoptions threshold np inf  would be useful generally as i'm sure theres other places these thresholds are used  say printing an estimator   i was working on something similar to tpot  where sklearn pipelines are evolved  deap  the evolutionary package  uses eval to recreate objects  so the repr is invoked here by default to make a new estimator  i have it working with my own _pprint function  but the reason i wanted this is just so i could get the repr easily for lambdas  without redefining _pprint   i agree  in 99  of cases the eval repr combination is not the best approach to recreating objects  but in this case its most inline with the existing deap design which has to be able to deal with all types of classes  not just sklearn  
 aishgrt1 all the coding for this issue  including comprehensive internal testing  is already done in pr #12319  could you please have a look at pr #12319 and comment there  i would love to have this finished while i may still remember the details 
 ogrisel using my example above with  n_estimators   20  and varying  n_jobs   it looks like you are correct that  2x memory is used  independent of  n_jobs   that's not too bad  actually  for some reason i thought it was worse  also  i can confirm that with threading backend and  n_jobs   20   the memory increases by only  4   i thought i had checked that earlier  but i may have been using an older version of scikit learn  sorry for the false alarm 
the problem actually comes from keras  not skl  my bad  please close this issue 
 rth it was intended   dtype none  should preserve the data type  and you can't force finite values on an object   dtype object  also fails  i've updated the example code 
my sklearn version is   scikit learn 0 19 1  
from what i saw    those stats are computed very frequently during tree queries  checking a parameter each time would remove most of the performance gain  we would check a boolean at many places instead of incrementing an int    the solution would be compiling a tree query with or without stats  but it cannot be handled with directives like  #ifdef and compilation arguments in cython  without an additional preprocessor like this one https   github com interpreters pypreprocessor   therefore i would need to duplicate some tree query functions and use them depending on the this parameter  to make the test outside those for loops instead of inside 
oh  sorry  i forgot about this part  i have uploaded my sample database  here's the link  https   github com wrdcz lfw_p blob master lfw_p zip  you might have to change the path at line 17 of code i have posted above  thanks 
this is my partial code  i can not show all my code because it's against company's rules  please understand  my dataset with 16 million samples and each sample have 150 dimension  i can't provide it either  the parameter i used in minibatch kmeans are as follows  seed   1 batch_size   5000 the code 
i cloned the source code from github and build up a scikit learn project locally 6 months ago  the project worked untill i updated it to the recent version on github  also  before i updated the project  i had my python  numpy  scipy  matplotlib  pandas and joblib all updated to the latest version  so i am not sure why i still has this import error 
i dive into the function  in fact   sklearn decomposition pca  uses  numpy linalg svd   https   docs scipy org doc numpy 1 14 0 reference generated numpy linalg svd html  so is not a pca but an svd  the  data_matrix  is not standardized so probably is the covariance matrix  two years ago i presume i got different results because of the fact that it was an svd so i thought it was thte correlation matrix  i don't think it's correct to say that it's a pca when it is  in fact  an svd  i hope some developer will clarify this point because i have to use it for a publication 
as mentioned  the issue is on the 32bit version only  without stratify the method is returning sensible results  i e   80000  2   20000  2 
i am doing this in order to get the shared components between two views of some data 
hi  i'm so sorry i'm not able to reproduce it
i'm currently setting things up locally for contributing a pull request  if it's ok for the core dev team  i would first look into fixing it by remembering the  remainder  transformer's columns as column names  instead of indices  if names are provided  this should in principle fix the issue without needing a column order check  and we would not have to remember the column order somewhere to check it later  
sure  i just wrote down the data shown in the plot  the first column is w i_p50 2 and the second column is m_star  so you can take log10 for both of them and then make the plot  ignore the condition  want   i have removed those unwanted points in the txt file  thanks for help  i truly appreciate it   mstar wp50 txt  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn files 3420037 mstar wp50 txt 
i executed it within pycharm  using the integrated viewer  and in an terminal to save the graphic with  plt savefig 'test png'    i'm using matplotlib 3 1 1 
yes  go ahead  i did not have time so far to look at it  i am unsure  since i have not studied the theory  but maybe there is a bigger issue with the nystroem implementation  giving  n  features to nystroem  it still produces  n  features with   fit_transform   only now the features are of a different dimensionality   n_components    i was hoping nystroem would actually only store compute a kernel matrix of  n_components  x  n    see storage and complexity  https   en wikipedia org wiki low rank_matrix_approximations#nystr c3 b6m_approximation  in its current state  it seems you still reach a  n  x  n  kernel matrix  which defeats the purpose of using nystroem  right  for example  nystroem should make it possible to do kernel ridge regression with many training examples  large  n    which would typically be very expensive  maybe i misunderstand how it is supposed to work  the example on scikit learn actually increases the dimensionality of the features from 64 to 300  https   scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn kernel_approximation nystroem html#sklearn kernel_approximation nystroem which seems like a strange example to me  the score is improved  but this is not an application where memory or complexity is reduced 
 jnothman   no  i have not reported this to spicy  but i will within the next 24 hours
i get the same behavior regardless of the parameter i pick  all other tree based classifiers i have used work as expected  this is the only one producing this bug 
i've pip installed joblib  0 14 0 and the error still reproduces  though it seems to be somewhat more intermittent  if you are trying to reproduce you may need to run the last cell a few times before the error is thrown  i've updated the github repo to use 0 14 0 if you'd like to try to reproduce the error yourself 
hello  ahmhashesh  i've submitted a  pr  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 15579  for this issue and it would be great if you could review it  still  do feel free to provide your own implementation as well    best regards
thanks   jnothman for your answer  i think with mwe will be more clear  basically  i want to use gridsearchcv   for the hyperparameter evaluation of clustering in scikit learn in an automatic way  here is a mwe   so  to fix that  i suggest that  silhouette_score    could return   1  in both extreme cases 
i try to install via pip   conda   now working with dev version  but in 0 22 its the same problem
i think the main case is that a matrix of zeros _is_ the confusion matrix in this case   confusion_matrix          returns a 0x0 array rather than error which seems to be the correct behavior  i'm a bit unclear of the condition being checked  https   github com scikit learn scikit learn blob db85b1264c5b0d24a944a9312c4f5a0cb2b033c9 sklearn metrics _classification py#l279  it seems the condition to check to raise a value error should be something like  any y not in labels for y in y_true  or any y not in labels for y in y_pred    currently if values appear in  y_true  or  y_pred  but not  labels  they are silently ignored which violates the expectation of  confusion_matrix  that  np sum confusion_matrix y_true  y_pred      len y_true  
anything goes  buy numpy arrays are obvious expected result 
the hyperlinks are now working great  however  switching theme is now broken  it displays a blank screen 
pretty sure i figured it out  will submit a pull request tonight 
yup confirmed to be a issue in alpha 2 and pre3  also visible on the latest test page  see fix here  https   github com collinreisdorf jquery mobile commit 13cf04089f865640f487d775b68b36e5cba46e89 i also sending a pull request with a fix for that  and #469 https   github com jquery jquery mobile issues #issue 469
the problem has nothing to do with hashes in the url  consider the following code  which reproduces the error   while writing this little demo  i found that the error is actually caused by the combination of setting ajaxenabled   false and the dynamic base manipulation  if you run this page in a browser which supports dynamic base manipulation  such as chrome   you'll see that clicking the "next" button will cause an error  if you load this page in a browser that does not support dynamic base manipulation  such as firefox   it works as expected  the link will cause the hash to change  which fires the hashchange event  which causes jquery mobile to advance to the next page  the reason the error is happening is because the  base  href is set incorrectly when the browser supports dynamic base manipulation  if you hover your house over the "next" button in chrome  you'll see what i mean  for example  if you were to copy the code above into a file at http   www example com test html  the "next" link in chrome would point to http   www example com #page2  however  it should point to http   www example com test html#page2  this is because the  base  href is set to http   www example com  in browsers that support the dynamic manipulation  therefore  the browser interprets a link of "#page2" to point to the directory  not the file test html  when the user clicks the link  the browser tries to load the new url  rather than just updating the hash so the hashchange event doesn't fire  the  base  href should point to the full url  so  in this case  the  base  href should be http   www example com test html in order to function properly

hello  i've tried it again and it fails again  actually when i try the 1 0a1 demo it works fine   maybe this is because the proxy of my mobile provider is between

yup  i tried with file     and on a remote webserver  same issue  http   epitech rihan fr epimdp init html
no  i don't think it's about the url type  it works when i set the method attribute explicitly  method "get" for example

test page  http   jsbin com omacox 144 it's much better than it was  the only browser where i'm still seeing the lag is android browser for ics  on a galaxy nexus   and then only after the first open close  given that the background overlay is optional  i'd say that's good enough 
it happens for both  i updated the demo here  http   jhaag us tip jquery
this is testing on a motorola droid 1  with android 2 2 1
using the latest works for me too    
curiously  window location hash seems to be empty  1  after body load  2  before link click  and 3  after link click  that's not normal  right 
i've tested it on iphone 3g safari and windows7 safari 5 0 3 
sure  just copy the code in the documentation for inline buttons  that's it    see here http   jsbin com ahari4
to the extent that reworking my code  to be correct  worked  yes   
thought you might ask  can i pm you the address  it is a private server 
i unfortunately no longer have access to our touchpad because it was an evaluation unit from hp that had to be returned  if i post on a server or as either a jsbin jsfiddle i don't have any way to verify that the sample correctly demonstrates the issue on that platform now  i have currently moved the additional resources into my head template to work around the problem as this seemed to work fine on the touchpad before we had to return our unit 
what i have found is that this issue is eliminatd if you use either jquery 1 44 or jquery 1 6  and it works fine

the following line is causing the problem    mobile changepage    '#login'    transition  "pop"  reverse  false  changehash  false     and the error given is  mpc trigger  "beforechangepage"    jquery mobile js 2922 uncaught typeerror  cannot call method 'trigger' of undefined no problems when tested in ff5 and android 2 1  thanks
will have a look but not sure if they work with phonegap  the problem has always been there
here you go  http   jsfiddle net hamutsi pwetd  i currently use there 1 0a4 and the listview   works fine  when you change it to 1 0b1 or b2 you see it stops working 
i am trying to post a jsp form without ajax  for example    form name 'test' method 'post' action 'test jsp' data ajax 'false'     input type text name username     input type password name password     button type submit name submit  logon   button      form   this form has to be submitted without ajax  since i have mentioned data ajax false  but it is still submitting as a ajax form  it was working fine with alpha jquery version 
perhaps that wasn't the best example    it seemed to illustrate the problem on my desktop browser  here's a simpler example  i'll also update the original link  http   jsfiddle net yzubs 2 
hi  yes  i'm still seeing this  tested just now after clearing browser cache history  i see this problem reliably on these devices platforms   ipod touch running ios 4 3 5  8l1  in safari  ipad running ios 4 3 5  8l1  in safari  ios simulator with ios 4 3 2  8h7  in safari  nexus one stock browser running android os 2 3 6  android emulator with os 2 2 and stock browser i have not tested with ios 5 beta releases  this problem does not seem to happen on desktop safari or firefox  fyi  others are reporting the same  here on the jqm forum where i also reported this issue  https   forum jquery com topic navigation issues on ios android with latest builds thanks  chris

i copy and paste the exact code from https   github com jquery jquery mobile issues 2190  android native app works  that is not my problem that i encounter  my problem is that when i add the following line script type "text javascript" charset "utf 8" src "phonegap 1 1 0 js"   script below the head tag to enable phonegap functionalities  after then  the android native app exit when click close on the dialog  http   www phonegap com start#android please copy the sample markup and code from issue 2190  add the phonegap library file  then run it in android emulator in eclipse  you will see that problem  jqm dialog close all native android app  ps  this problem only happen in a native app  desktop browsers all work fine

http   jsbin com omirod 43 look at the addressbar after clicking link one  going back and clicking link two  the address bar is pointing to #somepage id 1 
i haven't had time making a test page  but i have been working a bit more on this issue  and the difference between the pages is that  when the back button is working  the page is loaded by a javascript function calling    location  attr 'href'  url      and when the back button is not working  the page is loaded by a plain   a href "   "   tag
ok i updated your template with a simple test page  let me know if you see the problem  you can also see the issue at http   imc heroku com debug using ie8 
it is an iphone 4 with ios 5  remember zooming in is not the problem  zooming out is  if you zoom in on the list itself then try to zoom out it usually takes 2 3 tries to get it to work  to replicate    load the page   zoom in on the list so that one or two items take up the screen   let go off the zoom in gesture   try to zoom out
i refactored a bit to put the  html links from the ajax lists into my index html so they're hash links  with the latest jqm js and css the fixed header still isn't showing up if i back up when i've been scrolled down the list a ways  as of 5 minutes ago  confirmed working on the 1 0 jqm still 
i don't know if a is bin will work because its a custom build of jqm  i did do a little testing and if i add all the main components in the section with core it works so i think its a dependency that is not set  i also tried with 1 1 and got the same error  ill try and get something togeather when i'm back at a pc  on 28 jan 2013 19 11  "ghislain seguin" notifications github com wrote

hi  i confirm  the output is the same on 1 0 and 1 0 1  in fact  in my taphold event  i performs a call to the simpledialog2 plug in http   dev jtsage com jqm simpledialog demos2   code  lastselectedproject simpledialog2   'mode'   'button'  'headertext'   'information'  'buttonprompt'   "select an option below for '" + lastselectedproject children " projects title"  text   + "' project"  'zindex'   99999  'buttons'            code  so my guess is that in 1 0 1  the plug in disrupt the event so when taphold is called  next event is ignored  and with 1 1  rc1  the event is still delivered  so  i didn't notice the problem before upgrading to jqm 1 1  is it possible that the plug in disrupt events delivery   can you confirm that you can reproduce the problem with simpledialog2   about the behaviour  i think that is a taphold event is delivered for a component  a tap event should be dismissed to prevent such problems  no   thanks for your help
hi and thanks for the response  phonegap is down right now so it might take me some time to create the test files  as soon as it goes up again  i'll attach both the link to files and a compiled android app

hey todd  you can find a reproducer here  http   jsbin com aciwof 2 i've found the issue appears with both 1 1 0 and latest  but only when using jquery 1 6 4  which   as the documentation suggests  is supported  using jquery 1 7 1 works  so this is either a jquery bug or a jquery usage that is not applicable with 1 6
hmmm    to the first comment  you'd need an image on the server for the header which via phonegap works for all orientations and devices  in theory  so there's no size   it does have a max size in the css  but it's 100  basically otherwise i think  it's just really hard to squeeze all my non disclosed plugins  css etc  into your "test page"  i've taken a quick try and nothing is working with 1 7 2 on that test page   all i see is a spinning icon and the footer up top   i've been using a variety of things    fluid css like this     media only screen and  min width  481px    etc   lt link href "boilerplate css" rel "stylesheet" type "text css" gt   lt link href "css my_fluid css css" rel "stylesheet" type "text css" gt   lt link href "jquery mobile 1 1 0 jquery mobile 1 1 0 css" rel "stylesheet" type "text css"  gt   lt link href "css themes privateclientsstuff min css" rel "stylesheet" type "text css" gt   lt     if lt ie 9  gt   lt script src "  html5shiv googlecode com svn trunk html5 js" gt  lt  script gt   lt   endif    gt   lt script src "jquery mobile 1 1 0 jquery 1 7 2 js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "jquery mobile 1 1 0 overrides js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "jquery mobile 1 1 0 jquery mobile 1 1 0 js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "greensock tweenmax min js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "js utilities utilities js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "js myadnetwork 0 1 0 js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt   lt script src "js privateclientplugin 0 1 0 js" type "text javascript" gt  lt  script gt  well i'll burn an hour or two trying further but i doubt i can help you reproduce this  obvious to me and seems like a major  bug   i'd assumed someone in the forum would be well familiar with this problem  and a couple of weeks would result in something more    again my first impression is headers and footers should only exists once and be static and the content changes  it's seems like an after though  wasteful as it's duplicated and redundantly hacked for headers   footers to work  it appears as if they actually disappear after not animating to reveal a duplicate header underneath  so it seems static headers and footers is totally being done wrong  if it's static there should be only one entry needed  i think that's at the root of it's dysfunction  cause it clearly doesn't update the content section's top after the image in the duplicate banner loads resizes  stomping over the content area  
 mauriceg  i updated the issue by using on   instead of live    same problem on ios  works fine in chrome  firefox and safari on my mac  "anywhere" means anywhere else than the test div  e g  the nevermind div  the header or footer as well 
 ugomobi i know that its use may not be the standard  but i prefer a controlgroup instead of multiple buttons in the header  to make it more compact  especially if i have left buttons  right buttons and title  maybe there should be a common solution to position elements to right or left in the header  such as a data something instead of a button related class  or maybe renaming the class  i'm not sure of it    anyway  your solution seems ok to me   
 ugomobi jasper  the galaxy s ii is stuck  "no update available"  at android version 2 3 5  please bear in mind that this manifestation on the galaxy s ii is one i submitted because i can repeat it at will  and i know you guys want that for a bug submittal  but there is a bigger bug i've seen on the samsung galaxy sii  siii  note ii  htc one x  and google nexus 4  thus far of 13 android test phones i have   where all my menu buttons can freeze from time to time  however  i cannot reproduce the issue at will  unfortunately  so i cannot submit it as a bug report to you  as far as galaxy phones  i have a galaxy s  sii  siii  s4  and note ii on my desk  all upgraded to latest android os they can run  is there a way you can look at my phonegap app if i send you the download link  with it  the general  bigger bug will manifest itself from time to time  but with no guarantees when  but the galaxy s ii specific bug is 100  repeatable  if the user goes to certain scrollable screens  like my about or help screens  for instance   they will get stuck on it "forever"  with the navigation buttons animating and sounding  but not navigating to the target screen  until the user scrolls it all the way to the unscrolled position and then presses a button  at which time the app will navigate right away  i believe the galaxy s ii specific bug and the bigger bug are related  please let me know if you want me to send you the link for my beta version app  i probably should send that to you in private  however  since the app is in beta  if you have a galaxy sii to run my app on  this would really help a lot to let you see this issue in action  my beta version app uses phonegap 2 9 0 and jquery 1 9 1 and jquery mobile 1 3 1  thanks  jack

when you rotate the view in the windows phone emulator from landscape to portrait the screen don't resizing well  the footer fixed in lanscape doesn't work well on windows phone 
i fixed this by making the entire site ssl so no switching between http and https 
  deprecation   simply means that the feature will likely be removed in the future   you should be able to expect for it to still work correctly in the current version  it's unfortunately that api documentation has not been updated for 1 4   makes it kind of hard to decide what's a bug v s  unsupported feature that has not been removed yet  btw  the workaround for   mobile changepage   is to call  pagecontainer  "change"  to  options    on the pagecontainer widget  if you use the default container  you would call    mobile pagecontainer pagecontainer  "change"  to  options

i knew you would reply about the test page  i will try to come up with something but not sure if it works the same through a web app as it does through a native app  in the past i had to turn on hardware acceleration in the android manifest to get decent speed results using parts of jqm  unfortunately if it is only native app related  a test page will not work to show the issue i am having  i will see if can come up with a jsfiddle to see if i experience the same delays  do you have a link to a jsfiddle that has jqm 1 3 0 rc1 to use 
it doesnot work in chrome but works in firefox and safari browser
my apologies  there is no bug  it's just that some fields are pre filled hence the clear button appear  and sopme are not hence no clear button    sorry for the noise  this is a non issue some of the samples on 22 february 2013 20 54  jasper de groot notifications github com wrote 
thanks  i think i mean framework    you can get an example by copying source code from multiple pages demo eg  from 1 3 0 beta or rc1 demos  and changing stylesheet and script link to v1 3 0  changing css back to rc1 makes things working

tested in the android 4 1 2  standard browser and mozilla  and the assembly phonegap  if quick swipe  there is a closure panel  however  if slow swipe  is what is shown in the screenshot 
as you can see in the code i provided  the markup is generated  not hardcoded  i only use  and then i use handlebars js   ember js to create a button  the code worked fine using the previous jqm 
it does also happen with the latest source  if i can do anything else to support you finding the error please let me know 
recently on  1  iphone 6+ w  ios 8 1 2  ipod touch 5th gen w  ios 8 1 i noticed this awhile back on other ios devices with older versions of ios  but can't remember exactly which ones  i did not try other ios devices recently than mentioned above 
thanks for quick response  the result page response from server i'm getting is approximately following http   jsbin com ofuhaw 1344    the problem is that i have limited access to actual device  so now i cannot say for sure  also it seems that the main difference with the above code is in jquery version  could you check  does changing jquery 1 8 0 min js to jquery 1 9 1 min js fixes the bug  if yes   that is the issue of nuget jquery mobile package  not jquery mobile itself

this happened with cordova as well as non cordova cocoon build  not doing anything unusual  by inside the archive i just mean that the html file is packaged into the ipa file  like any hybrid app  i mention cocoon because they also offer a "launcher"  which is a build using same configurations and presumably the same ios components  but that lets you specify a url on launch to load the html5 app remotely  when run this way  the bug does not occur  hope that clarifies    all needed info should be in my initial description  as i think about this  it may not be a jqm bug so much as a webview bug  the links to "#" should obviously know that they are to the current document  the problem is that they are not being treated that way 
by including the css i got it working  however  i still have the problem with a bigger project and i can't find a way to incriminate properly jqm  jquery or simply ios9  if someone could help that would be great

well the issue still exists  but i was just able to get it to work by deleting  tmp npm   then trying to install again and repeating the process until it worked  this isn't an operator error  i was just able to mess around until it got to work  do you still think it would be a good idea to close

here you go  edit  looking at this    it's not much of a test of the two environments etc  not sure how to make a _real_ test of this sort of thing 
 aheckmann you can see it here  https   gist github com 2958796
yes sure  sorry for my importunity please 
just tried with 2 6 2  also 2 5 7 had this issue as i think 
well    it would be difficult    in general i do a several tasks  like   saving some fields of a document instance and the problem occurs when removing    however i didn't have the bug earlier    then the following change i have made  from  1  define schema a 2  define schema b  having an array of schema a 3  define schema c  having an array of schema b to 1  define schema a 2  define schema b1  having an array of schema a 3  define schema b2  having an array of ids of schema a  then i populate them     4  define schema c  having an array of schema b1 note schema b1 and b2 have exactly the same structure  except the difference of the definition of the instance of the array to schema a  then i define schema a  schema b2 and schema c to have model instances  then i have a schema b2 type fetched and populated document to be pushed into the schema b1 array of a schema c document  finally i do certain manipulations  and remove the item from the array     its a bit complicated  i'll try to create a test case later 
i found out why it didn't work  my schema didn't contain the name field  i added the field and it worked  the reason i didn't discover this earlier was because apparently you can create new documents without the schema being complete 
yeah sure  the code i'm working on currently is delivering advert playlists to cinemas   we get multiple playlist feeds coming in from different upstream sources via multiple cron jobs and then these trigger a job per playlist to actually do the outbound delivery down to individual sites  fairly easy  no concurrency problems here yet  but we also have another cron job that rounds up playlists that need to be removed  i e  we don't get them from the feeds any more but they're still sitting in the cinemas themselves  and this is essentially continually running so might occur in between the read and the write of the scenario listed above   slim but i'd rather be sure  and this job essentially just updates the state of each playlist in this central location  strange as it may seem we need 0 items in a playlist because often they'll send down blank playlists as placeholders for individual cinemas to place local advertising in  another scenario i've found this to be a problem is when trying to do a put request with raw form data  if the nested list has no items then no key is sent from the form  schema example  let me know if you need more  it's slimmed down  syntax may not be 100     the playlist attribute is not actually required in this example to my understanding  not sure if there is a way to enforce a minoccurs maxoccurs  would be useful to know if there is a way   however if you supply the full schema  without the playlist attr  the playlist will remain there because it always does  set and not an overwrite  
productschema   new schema   _id  objectid      options   i've snipped out fields not used in the above query for readability  from a business rules perspective  products can have between 0 and 4 images  although we do not enforce this through mongoose 
i create file test js with this contents   node js version is 0 8 8 when i install mongoose from  git   github com learnboost mongoose#master  error doesn't reproduce 
mongo 2 2 mongoose 3 3 1 aggregation keeps throwing the above error for every collection  not sure where to start looking for details for this

yes  same behavior in the two previous releases  i've been trying  and i keep hoping the next release will fix it 
 aheckmann i need a maximum length maxlength  validator for string fields in schema  each string fields have different maxlengths  so i need a common validator for maxlength with length of string need to be passed to validation function  so that i can control maxlength of different string fields from common validation function  not by writing different validation function for each string fields in schema 
no  i ended up getting the entire subdocument and deleting the parts i didn't want to pass on 
sure  it happens when i try to save the user model  which normally works just fine  
thanks  vkarpov15  i've realised the error in my ways  for some reason i thought  model update  returned a promise instead of a query  i am  in fact  using  mongoose promise   require 'q'  promise    that was a typo on my behalf  i've tested and it is in fact working correctly   sorry about the confusion and thanks for pointing me in the right direction    finally  i also noticed that  http   mongoosejs com docs api html#model_model aggregate says it returns   aggregate  promise   when in fact  it returns an  aggregate  and you need to do an  exec    to get the promise  should i create a pr to change this documentation or is there a reason for this  thanks for brilliant library and the quick response 
because it is an existing distributed project  written not only on nodejs  scheme has already been defined and everything is already running 
my aggregate function is  translated from coffeescript     i'm just doing a count before the aggregation  if this is still not obvious  i will create a dedicated code to reproduce more easily the crash 
sorry  i try to explain the problem   as you can see  my schema has one non required field    parent   in mongoose 3 8 24 if i try to save item like this  it works fine    i agree  parent is not defiend  his value is equals to  undefined   but  normally  mongoose ignore this field and don't try to save this value in mongodb if field is not setted
well  i'm using the post save as a place to update some related models' data based on the last saved values of the parent model  i'm not really happy with that  but the children need the info to be up to date and i thought it'd be the safest way to do it  so i don't have a strategy of how i want to handle the error that happens in there yet  i'm just cognizant that there could be one  and so the app needs to be alerted to it  we might end up retrying or doing a transaction rollback or something  not sure yet 
mongoose   3 8 8 i tried updating to 3 8 13 but still i get following error
i have a sharded cluster with 2 shards and each shard have 1 primary   1 secondary and 1 arbiter  am using mongodb   3 0 5 and mongoose 4 0 3 version  when secondary instances are down and when i query from mongo shell with readpreference as secondary   am getting error message as 'no good nodes on rs1'  the same error gets displayed through mongodb native driver  but from mongoose am getting success result  hence i doubt if readpreference works or not with mongoose
i guess it was because of different versions in mongoose dependency  i just can't reproduce it after unlinking and full reinstall 
 alabid yes in my case mythingcontainer things is populated  do you mean push   is not supposed to work with populated arrays  here's my code  a building is a specialized group  and a residence contains an array of group objects 
not embedded  it is a reference  when i call populate on a query i get the result i want  i just need the same thing without calling a query to the db     i am creating models from a cache and need to construct them and populate them manually 
i have updated the schema and still getting errors  my schema and code to save now looks like this   so  not sure what i'm doing wrong and everything seems right  any help insight would be appreciated  thanks 
hi  using mongoose version 3 8 19  unfortunately this trick  code user addresses 0    address toobject    code  does not work  the error is 
hi valeri here is the snippet
oh damn  totally my bad    still makes me wonder why such a query is accepted though  and why it worked for the first 5 queries 8 
mongoose version is 3 9 7  yes  it works fine without node inspector 
hi   the connection code is   mongoose connect util format " s  s_ s" config db mongouri  s config db tenantid  replaceall ' ' '_'   config db name  function err   where mongouri   mongodb   hostname1 port mongodb   hostname2 port mongodb   hostname2 port 1  i have tried supplying options with replicaset   but with no use  2  i have tried not using "mongodb " in the second and third hostnames  but no use  yes  i can able to connect to replicaset from shell  thanks in advance 
that is exactly what i would expect  thank you  i prefer the way you have it implemented  no fields are marked as modified initially  it would be handy to have a second parameter which would flip that logic  for example  my front end code keeps track of dirty fields and posts only those fields to the update service  my backend assumes that any fields passed to it are modified and should be persisted to the database  i know not all services work this way  but it is certainly a use case and would save me  and others  from looping over all the fields  can you give any insight on how validation would work  what if i hydrate a document with only modified fields per my use case above  will validation fail on non hydrated fields  thanks 
 vkarpov15 you are right  it works out of the box  i was in the middle of refactoring while i play with new mongo 3 0  anyway  i knew that you works at mongodb inc and are a maintainer of mongoose project and node mongodb native  mongoose has a dependency of  mongodb  2 0   is it ok to work with  mongod 3 0    is mongoose always going to sync with the latest greatest feature of mongodb 3 0 and onwards  i recently noticed that  mongoskin  is not being maintained and looking for maintainers  i am afraid if i bet too much on mongoose  then it happens to be like  mongoskin  project  i am sure that  node mongodb native  is officially node js driver repo by mongodb inc  but i love the mongoose schema concept

i've replicated the issue with test cases  and now fixed  in the pull request referenced above pr #2732
last stable version 3 8 24 and the latest version 4 0 0 2015 03 11 18 56 gmt+01 00 valeri karpov notifications github com 
i have set a simple unit test on a test model  this is the model   best  carlos 
mongoose 4 0 1 iojs 1 6 2
the  callback  function was never called  and the return of  mongoose connection db eval  was  undefine    vkarpov15
well it looks like the issue was resolved somewhere along the way  because the test failed at the time and it doesn't now  merging the pr wouldnt hurt
it looks like this  not sure if it helps   process finished with exit code 8
it appears to be  lib error js' line 11  where it used arguments callee  i'm using mongoose 4 0 2  node 0 12 4   harmony and   use_strict is turned on
given   as you can see  the error returned by  update    is only for the first encountered error  so you don't get to see that there are other errors that need resolving   save    on the other hand provides an object containing errors for each property

i get a complete request from browser  so i simply pass req body to the profile model  so i wont need to set   any array  i give you a rough example   now as i already have a request which in the form that i can directly use in my model  i dont need to set    so for this purpose i need to use markmodified multiple times  which is quite painful
holy crap  meant to put this in sidekiq's issue queue  don't know what the heck i was thinking  brainfart  apologies   
sure will do give me a few hours
 vkarpov15 i appreciate you tagging it with help and question  but i found the issue  express in our code is using the default mongoose connection to store session info  which was causing the problem  after creating its own connection  the times went back to normal  i hope people can benefit from this problem

3 8 25 i could try to update to 3 8 34 
yep  having the mongoose doc available in  result value  when  rawresult  true  should cover my use case  thanks 
thanks for your reply  i can confirm that the document is not being deleted from the database at any stage  we have some static configuration schedules in the database  to dictate when certain tasks are to be run  and when they run  we update their  lastrun  timestamp and that's all that happens  this happens with a regular   save    call as per the above  moreover  we've had this setup running for more than 2 years now  with various tasks  but this error only occurs with this one particular task  and only started happening in the last month or so  without us making any changes to the task  so it seems like the problem may lie deeper  we are running on mongod version 3 6 11  mmapv1  at the moment 
yeap  i have a model named conversation which is transversal to any model  i defined it like this   no more code than this should be relevant 
you're right  i upgraded to last version and it works fine now  any other potentially dangerous behavior that we should be aware of  just want to make sure we are using mongoose in the safest possible way and avoid undesired massive updates removes  i appreciate the prompt response 
version    3 8 8  
apologies for the late response  vkarpov15 ill test it out with 4 2 3
oops  sorry  https   github com spamguy diplomacy blob master server models season js
thanks for looking into it  lineus  i don't think this validator should be called at all  it's a validator for the  whole  array   and you don't have the whole array here  just some of its elements  the only validators that should be called here are the validators for individual array  elements   also take a look here  https   mongoosejs com docs validation html cheers 
it's causing a lot of a trouble  javascript has no reasonable way of creating an execution context  the only existing api that was available in node js was deprecated a while ago  the only way to implement transactions in js is to pass along the transaction handle manually  which gets incredibly hard in complex systems  all methods have to be transaction aware  mongoose implemented a nice approach  it's possible to associate a transaction with a document instance using  doc  session handle   and it'll automatically use the handle for all  doc  related queries  it allows writing custom schema methods that simply retrieve the current handle using  this  session    and then they pass it along  it works nicely  but unfortunately breaks for subdocs as described in the first post  it's even more confusing when you create a document using mongoose from within transaction  its handle is associated with the doc automatically  but it's not available from subdocs  cc  vkarpov15  i think you originally added the   session    helper 
i upgrade code from api docs   doc invalidate 'size' 'must be less than 20'  'customkind'  14     doc validate function  err      console log err       prints     message  'validation failed'    name  'validationerror'    errors      size      message  'must be less than 20'    name  'validatorerror'    path  'size'    type  'customkind'    value  14

yes i was able to execute the same query in monghub actually 
i solved my problem  and your suggestion to look at registering models helped me to solve it  apparently i was registering a model in an included file prior to attempting to apply the global plugin  this prevents the global plugin from being applied  i moved the global plugin near the beginning of the app  and now the plugin is applied to all models  thanks for the help 
answer for 1st question is  unique id's are  place_id     lat lng   2nd question's answer  using model save   inside an async loop 
 vkarpov15 i have been storing an array of document and some of the elements in that array are already present in mongodb  now i want the old one to be replaced and the new one to be inserted just by one command  i came across  update  query with  upsert  option but not sure if that's the perfect way of achieving that for an array  after some search  i came to know that  dropdups  is deprecated in newer versions  so its not working now  just let me know if there is any field i can add while creating schema or a command for achieving the same for saving array of documents 
 vkarpov15 this is weird  your test fails for me using 4 9 0  i think i'll have to investigate further 
 vkarpov15 i don't think there is any issue here  i think what i'm remembering is wrong  apologies and thanks for the help

thanks a lot for the answer  i've fixed it in  this way  http   stackoverflow com questions 38609323 handle mongod stop with nodejs and mongoose   it was not an mongoose issue but the lack of my experience 
sneaking to close issue  such dishonor 
yes sir  like this   my goal is that any subsequent request to mongo going down will fail immediately
ah sorry  forgot to clarify in the text  it's only in the subject  i am encountering timeouts after a rather short time  1 minute or so  
exactly like in the example  that's why i left it out   i will close this since it seems that like it's not reproducible  since i cannot post my whole project which is quite big  i avoided the problem by not using  mongoose createconnection   i solved my problem another way with still using  mongoose connect  
i'm using version 1 0 3 of mongoose dateonly  both dateonly and mongoose dateonly has not been updated in a long time  i've tested to verify the odd incongruities between your results and mine and i've found that with mongoose   4 11 2 the result is always set on the current day date  ignoring the value passed in dateofbirth  for a test i've set my system date and time in the future  august 24th 2018  and the result for mongoose 4 11 2 was  while on mongoose 4 11 1 the result was coherent with the one presented in my previous post  in my tests i've only changed mongoose package version  while using the latest for mongoose dateonly 
i'm pretty sure it is related to https   github com automattic mongoose issues 1987  but i didn't see any mention of it in the release notes  as for recreating it  i used the code from https   github com simonholmes getting mean tree chapter 11  i added the following script to a scripts folder in the project to illustrate the change   result with mongoose 3 8 0  deleted created distance  1 7453292699914073e 9 result with mongoose 4 8 5  deleted created distance  0 011131884616932194
was mas my mistake  there was something wrong with the code  thanks a lot 
the connection is being created using something like this 
yes  we define our hooks before calling mongoose model  
here is my schema  it is very normal  i debugged the code of moongoose  moogose put safe  null without setting it  is there any way to remove this  
i wish i could but unfortunately it seems environment related so i can't even reproduce in local   
 vkarpov15   my webpack config ts   that you spoke of  still didn't work 
i'm using bluebird  and i just have ssl true
i am exporting the connections using  module exports conn1   connection1   i am also exporting the mongoose instance using  module exports mongoose   mongoose   then i am using them in my model file as such
for some reason i can't reproduce the error  i do notice that err and myobject are null  perhaps an idea if the object can't be found that the err object contains an actual error for example  "can't find object with id" i am used to working with java and empty error objects when there is an error is a wierd thing  perhaps it's more normal in the javascript world 
i tried two different methods  the strange thing is it doesn't reach that part of the code  atempt one   var db   mongoose connect config db    options    user  'username'  pass  '_password_'      function err    if  err    console error 'could not connect to mongodb '   console log chalk red err           atempt two look like   in other words  it's not bootstrapping to the authentication methods 
 vkarpov15 apologies for missing this  we didn't find cursor   to be a drop in replacement  mainly due to this issue  https   github com automattic mongoose issues 8039 and the cursor   method operates orders of magnitude slower than stream    likely because it still appears to load only one single record at a time  we are currently running and testing at version 5 7 0
i'm not using or calling ensureindex   anywhere in my code  see below                                                                     var mongoose   require 'mongoose'   mongoose promise   require 'bluebird'   var fs   require 'fs'   var uri   'mongodb   user password domain com dbname'  var optionsssl       read in certs   var connectionoptions       specify connection options including optionsssl   mongoose connect uri  connectionoptions  function err    if  err   console log err                                                                           i also feel that this is a strange behavior  may be this has to do with the   mongodb server version    i am using mongodb server version  3 4 9 
no  i mean if you made debug  you can see the arrays attached to the mongoose model are mongoosearray objects  but the arrays inside those mongoosearray are simple array objects 
sorry but i think you missed the point   userid in this example is an objectid  but i need to compare it against an array of object ids  i e  find documents in users collection for any of these users    when i pass an array of object ids via an api they will necessarily be considered strings  if i recall  mongodb will handle an  in operation against an array of strings gracefully i e  coerce them into being handled as objectids  this request is that mongoose do the same 
hello my friend  i installed version 4 13 9 mongoos that you corrected this item but i did not answer my problem is mentioned in  this link  https   github com automattic mongoose issues 5986   too thank you   
i had no regex setup  basically a schema and model  thats it  when i ran nodemon index js the error illustrated in the picture would come up  after deliberating for a while decided to remove line 203 204 from semver js file  another error message prompted my to take a look at line 232  i removed it and the result was mongoose connection was initiated  i no longer have the code  as i decided to just use mongoclient instead
 import  decimal128  from "bson"  ends up as  const bson require "bson"   and  bson decimal128  i wouldn't say this is a mongoose bug   changed the title already  what is strange though is the error message claiming that cast to _array_ didn't work  
api is not es6+ friendly  code itself is not written in es6+
i was defining it in the schema with the expectation that it would apply it at the collection level  example   i have enough information now to continue moving forward  thank you for the  mongoose connection createcollection    tip
its going to be difficult to share our webpack config as its a huge project  but i'll see if i can come up with a simplified one that will reproduce this  though i suspect its due to the size of the project and resulting source map files that causes this to be such a clear issue  so  new error    is not actually the slow part  its the   stack  calls on the error  as the stack is only generated when used because it is an expensive operation  so we generally don't have this issue very often because the stack is only needed when there's an actual error in the system where we need to report the stack trace  typically no worse than once every few minutes and generally much rarer in production  in the case of the   save    call every mongoose write  a new stack trace is getting generated  well two actually  one for   __ saving  and one for  originalstack    our system does many writes  usually a few hundred per second  so even in production the extra 10 20ms adds up really quickly  i would guess even if we weren't using webpack  there's still the 10 20ms hit here as a stack trace on a minified file  without a source map  would be similar to a non webpacked stack trace in terms of this performance hit  i do understand the value of having the  originalstack  for debugging purposes  and this is why i suggest a flag  as it could be handy for many people to switch this off in production to give faster performance while switching it on in development for easier debugging  as for the  parallelsaveerror   this one i'm not sure what the solution should be to have a similar purpose to what is intended  though i do note at the moment as far as i can tell the error is not actually used anywhere  and the   __ saving  value is practically ignored  but i presume its also a case of handy to know about in development and possible to switch off in prod  or at least in prod  generate the error when it occurs giving a less useful stack trace  but still letting you know it has occurred in prod 
sure  i hope this helps  though the schema is generated by typegoose 
 vkarpov15 hello  sorry for such late response  i figured that out  yes  its was problem with schema  by the way i am wondering why there is no option for not specifying replicaset when connecting to multiple ip addresses like it was in 4 5 8 version  i am exposing kubernetes cluster and when i specify the replicaset cluster changes the host addresses and everything is being screwed
yes   i want to to skip incrementing updatedat for a special update  for example    case 1  user login action   update the "updatedat" and update other field case 2  user logout action    don't update the updateat but also update the other field how can i achieve that  many thanks 
 vkarpov15   i tried that too but it was also not working as it returns date in "thu oct 18 2018 12 07 34 gmt+0530  india standard time " format where i'm storing date in iso string format i e "2018 10 18t06 38 01 709z"
hi  mhombach sure  given the following schemas 
it seemed to be a transienttransactionerror  solved on stacloverflow  thanks
here you go 
i'm afraid not   my local mongodb has been misbehaving  which is why i saw the exception in the first place  you would need a db with socket timeouts in order to repro   i don't have any code executing  just an idle connection  
schema looks like this  but the bug only happened for specific documents     800 count query result
in my controllers i am updating the data using the   finbyidandupdate     i am giving option   overwrite true   so that if i don't pass any field object or array  it should become empty instead of taking previous values so if i pass overwrite true in options it is overwriting both created_at and modified_at instead of updating only modified_at

if i have logs per  branch   review app environments  i would need to edit my code for each an ever new branch  how would you make sure the registration only happens once  imagine if it bases on client guid's     a new client  would have it's own collection  i would then need to check if the registrations for such client already existed or not     _5 minutes later i wrote the text above  a solution    _ from your comment i started wonder and i've tried this successfully   and i got it to work pretty well    just wish i could do the same  check for model availability  without the try catch     but then again  we're kind'a used to when it comes to async await as well thanks  vkarpov15
splice did get fixed  but unshift is still showing the same behavior as before  here is a second test for below that snippet https   github com automattic mongoose commit a3ab3a65d361eff6e39ef79dcdbd3ac7a11de5b1 
of course  it's a major security issue  for my use case  i receive the info used to create the document from user input so a hacker could screw the database by manually supplying the _ids it's easy to validate this but it doesn't make sense to be able to modify something that is automatically generated  i assumed that it works like sql auto increment and would just ignore the supplied id  it only makes sense to accept the field when i explicitly add it to the schema  i hope that you revise this and only allow modifying the _id if it's included in the schema just like other fields 
sorry  my mistake  i'm trying to find the field with object data array like   list     name  string  cost  number  quantity  number     by string value  that is not good  i should request it like this   somemodel find   list     nin    null  undefined             it related to this issue  #7242 thank you  i close this issue

i've installed the downloadable build  i'm a composer noob  command line noob in general  so i need to wait until updated build is available order integrate the changes manually   
that's true mark  updated my issue 
results are the same in both chrome and firefox  your expression works  so apparently the regex engine we're using is not pcre compliant  i see that  d is not supported by posix  or gnu grep   though it's a pretty standard usage in my experience  validating a phone number gets pretty verbose without it and it's certainly recognized by any recent version of javascript  is this an extjs issue  if we're stuck  i guess this would be an option   convert pcre to regexp  https   www npmjs com package pcre to regexp 
askarii submitted  shaun mccormick wrote  as for site_url we removed it after seeing that it didn't change anything  so its the modx default now 
skndn60 submitted  yes  i mean the menus in the banner of the manager  "home"  "site"  "components" etc    they are a pain as they pop up immediately as you pass over them with your mouse  generally with these kind of menu bars  they are designed to have a short delay before they pop down out to prevent unintended action 
ok  can be closed  thanks 
gadamiak submitted  giving a second thought on this  i agree that behavior requested should not rely on container setting  the better way is to rely on the alias setting  which would make it consistent with other resource types  modweblink should use its alias  like other resource types  while it's ignored  thus in example above  the news weblink should present alias content for the url or the target's when alias is empty  combined with the current container setting it will give full control on the url behavior 
pyrographics submitted  i set up a new content type for jpg images and added that content type as the form customization default value  just to note  the manager correctly replaces the normal value  html  when you switch to the page settings tab before creating the resource but if you just save the resource without first switching tabs it does not 
strangely  yes  i can create a new template and specify an existing static file 
trianman submitted   else    fixes this problem but on the http   rtfm modx com display revolution20 input+and+output+filters+ 28output+modifiers 29 there is no one word about obligatory usage of  else eg   but it doesn't matter  the erroneous behavior occurs also with  show   hide   userinfo modifiers  the matter is the modparser  look at this lines   pre   tagoutput   this  processtag  tag   processuncacheable   if    tagoutput     null     tagoutput     false      removeunprocessed     tagmap  tag 0    ''   processed++    elseif   tagoutput     null     tagoutput     false     tagmap  tag 0     tagoutput  if   tag 0       tagoutput   processed++      pre  modparser intends to have  tagoutput   null with  removeunprocessed  true or  tagoutput     null our situation produces  tagoutput   null with  removeunprocessed   false maybe we have to fix the modparser not the modoutputfilter  something like this   pre   tagoutput   this  processtag  tag   processuncacheable   if   tag 0       tagoutput     tagmap  tag 0     string  tagoutput   processed++      pre  but i'm not shure because i don't understand quite well the meaning of  removeunprocessed

hi  i did exactly this  also in different project  in all the projects with 2 2 15 happen this and doesnt work  earlier versions 2 2 15 its ok  any idea or maybe a problem with 2 2 15 
in previous versions of modx    2 5 4  there were no problems  after upgrading to 2 5 4  the error 200 ok message is back when the user is going to a resource to update  see the forum for more info about this error  many had this problem in the past  i also  when checking 'view_template' the error is gone  to me that seems like a bug

no  just a https rewrite  worked fine before upgrade and haven't changed anything 
sure  but it doesn't matter what header is set     just do a post to somewhere using an array as json content  you'll see that e g  the content type header  application json   set by the preparepayload   method  gets cleared by prepareheaders    it simply creates sets a new array instead of adding its headers  that leads to a  default   form related content type which is send to the server  which isn't correct 
 joshualuckers  mark h thanks for the questions  turns out the client had a plugin installed on the server to help with caching to speed up the load time and it was causing the problem  i'll close out this issue 
it is not a requirement to be on packagist we can still require modx using other composer methods  i think that is a matter of configuration  they managed to do it with wordpress  for example  https   github com roots bedrock

 jonleverrier in the screenshot you posted  you can click on the image in the upper right of the sidebar and it will show a popup image preview at full size of the image  i'm thinking a double click would just open the same popup  further  that popup shows the full image but has scroll bars  maybe a slightly improved image preview popup is in order  like a full size lightbox for example  double click needs some kind of behavior  i mean  it is actually doing something now  it goes to this blank page  maybe in the past this had a different behavior  why the blank page  regardless  using the same popup as the sidebar is an easy button fix perhaps

hi mark  just for clarification  there is an "orthographic agreement" for all countries with portuguese as primary native language that is implemented for several years now  the objective of this agreement is to have all countries writing on the same way  so i believe that there is little sense to talk about portuguese from portugal or portuguese from brazil  or angola  or mozambique  etc   please consider changing this to "portuguese" only  i am also willing to help with this translation  portuguese is my native language  so this portuguese translation will be the same for pt pt and pt br lexicons  i will try to be as generic as possible trying to avoid expressions that can be typically from portugal as there are some relevant semantic differences from portugal and brazil  as an example   but i can check and continue the portuguese translation that is already visible in croudin  thanks

almost   the ipython script has   so it seems that ipython is adding the two extra paths at the top  one of the weird things is that one of the paths it adds it doesn't really add  but just moves it to the top   site packages   while the other shouldn't really even be in  sys path

i would like to get some information about each engine on startup and store it in mongodb for later use  engine_id  hostname  arch  os  proctype  nbits  procspeed  ncpus  ncpucores  memory  load  address  pools   depending on these information  i can give tasks to specific engines  when i try to get these information via dview while long running tasks are already running  my client is blocked   gets a timeout  that's why i would like to get that information first  before allowing the controller to give tasks to the engine  i will try out your hint  but i guess that the engine isn't registered at the time excuting startup_script   startup_command  which would mean that the engine_id is unknown 
sorry for the long delay  i'm now using your mergekernel branch  but i can still reproduce this problem  an aborted task still seems to stick to the engine and can't be resubmitted because the hub thinks it's still inflight

indeed  those lines are just redundant  and removing the sys stdout assignment in init seems to fix everything  it makes debugging possible  and also fixes the original issue of output not printed  i suppose you only cannot put print debug statements inside the inner part of  process_input_line   but that is already the case right now   thanks for looking at it  will do a pr for that

i was recently accidentally updating via pip even so i usually keep up to date via github  could it be that  i'm not sure i understand your question  my understanding of the deployment processes is rudimentary at best  i'm quite angry at myself to have potentially messed up things with pip     i will try a 'clean'   
i was more 'shocked' that i get an error using a method that was 'on offer'  this is an interesting expectation change on my end over the years  10 years ago i would totally expect that the user has to know when how to use a method  but this days  with dynamic object manipulation depending on contents  i'm kinda expecting that a method on offer doesn't bark at me merely for using it  but instead friendly lets me know that it's of no use to me  though i see that a thrown error can be much more useful in a bigger application  maybe my opinion on this is skewed from too much interactive working  you could always return a dict of lists  with the lists having only 1 element  there are several packages out there that follow that paradigm  well  i'm not sure what i meant either with tuples     i think i just cannot think in terms of actually being interested in the engine number when i was not interested in what goes where in the first place  having used a load balanced view that even does not give me that control  so maybe one should rather question the existence of the method like this in a result object coming from a lbview 
the current documentation says otherwise  see here  http   ipython org ipython doc dev interactive htmlnotebook html i'm not just suggesting to guarantee that it's importable  i'm suggesting that it guarantee that the specified cell structure will actually be respected  of course  if you want to guarantee even more  what    that's fine with me

the engines are on a different computer and the engines use the default working dir  whatever is used when running the "ipcluster engine" from a comandline  just to make it clear  my "project" consists of two files  functions py and main py  running main py with a above code worked before the change but not with the change from #2395  if that's really the intended change  then how would one split code into different files  do i really have to put every function into main py  from my current understading  both of this is not possible    splitting the remote function into a different file  this issue   update  ok  with   interactive     running a function remotely which calls a function from the same file where the function comes from https   github com ipython ipython issues 2473#issuecomment 9200719 so splitting code and organizing it is actually not possible at all  your remote function must be single function  or use code from installed libraries

i get the above error on load  i get the following error on save  unexpected error while saving file  02_pandas ipynb pop   takes at most 1 argument  2 given 
i wasn't quite sure how much information i should include so i probably over did it  but that aside  the main reason i ended up working on this is mainly because i _thought_ i needed to use it  so at the moment it might not be absolutely necessary in my use case  however i have implemented a case in which one might want to add a  slope  attribute to a  group  object containing a series of shapes to rotate them a given number of degrees  i've demonstrated this with a  notebook  http   nbviewer ipython org github rmorshea misc blob testing docs svg ipynb  in cells 13 and 14  in this particular case one probably wouldn't want  slope  to be an attribute that would be common to all  group  objects

just have elasticsearch_http with a dns host parameter that either can't resolve or say you change dns to something else  it kills logstash  but what if you had multiple outputs  getting error is good about can't resolve hostname but to stop logstash might not be the best error handling for this output 
perhaps my thinking is just incorrect  i wanted to see how the system would behave if we fell behind in indexing  the setup is syslog traps etc    ls no filtering     rabbitmq    ls filters     es we have multiple indexers pulling from rabbitmq and i've been trying to expirement with load performance tuning  to make a long story short  i found the no_ack    true setting on rabbitmq input to considerably improve performance  with no_ack    false getting above 1500 sec or so in this setup was difficult  with no_ack true i was seeing 7 8k sec without missing a beat queue remained empty  however  i was concerned that i _never_ saw the queue in rabbitmq fill up  so i wanted to confirm that if indexing fell behind the mq would fill up  and things wouldn't just fall over  atleast with no_ack    false i would see the mq fill up during heavy load  and we'd eventually recover  i was trying to confirm if no_ack just had _that_ high of a throughput or if something was wrong where ls would crash instead of messages backing up   it seems to be the latter     my understanding is if filter workers backed up that ls should stop receiving input  thus the mq should begin filling  correct  what i observed was kibana showing me getting farther and farther behind vs current time  meanwhile the mq showing 0 in it's queue  eventually the above oom happened and the mq began filling  unfortunately the workers never recovered  since i am using no_ack    true all messages in logstash not yet processed multiple hundred thousand  are lost forever  i tested this with a 2gb and 8gb on a jvm  in both cases  ls consumed every possible message from rabbitmq until it reached a critical point where it no longer received messages  nor processed what it had already slurped up  perhaps the issue is ls will do this behaviour and thus oom  instead of stopping consumption of events

having to add a new source each time is kind of a time wasting for users  with corporate proxies  you have either to handle the authentication for only those url  or indeed upload the file manually on the internal binaries server  the url format is different from the others  sometimes there won't even be an associated hash with each binaries  and so on  speaking about the general case here  didn't check yours yet   my point is those "central" servers are so much used that i can't why an oss project wouldn't push his releases there  it's only some hours  maximum  work  but would definitely be useful for many a user  le lun  27 oct  2014 22 52  jordan sissel notifications github com a écrit

yeah  we need some degree of it  end of the day as we're using a common platform for plugins we need some validation to actually let inside our system only logstash plugins and for the online installation we actually do the validation across the wire _before we download_  the problem that happen is that this is actually slower than download

i guess for me  i'd expected how to configure logstash to send this monitoring data to kibana to be in the logstash docs  i looked in the kibana docs as well tbh after i couldn't find it  looking in the x pack docs  to find the details  was the last thing i thought to do  but that's the way my brain works  "i want to configure logstash to show up in the monitoring tab in kibana  so i should consult the logstash docs to find out how to do this"  i'm not suggesting moving or duplicating the details in the x pack docs  but maybe just a link with some text like "looking to configure logstash with x pack monitoring  go here to find out how " or something would be useful

thanks  colinsurprenant   using your debugging steps i managed to pinpoint the issue  turns out my date block was duplicated in the logstash config  one per filter block   after removing the duplicate it's processing the timestamp correctly  afaict with test data   will try the newly crafted config on a dev instance and will let you know if there's additional issues down the pipeline 
 purbon i agree idempotent updates are important and i think the   version flag should solve it if we resolve the conflicts within the update operation  update or uninstall dependent plugins   the current way to install a specific version of a plugin is to uninstall all plugins that depend on it first  then uninstall the actual plugin and reinstall it with "install   version"  uninstall command user feedback is another item  success and failure  +reasons why  should be clearly displayed and i'm +1 on more feedback here

hi   although conf is huge here is relevant to the above   template used is the default with logstash  dns filter   the geoip ip and geoip location are the only one which are causing conflict  i have even tried disabling one of the custom geo fields for transaction thinking it might be causing conflict but it does not  default index logstash    is in place so default template should pick up  help would be appreciated   vik
seems that 2 1 does not terminate in this case  i actually prefer the 1 x behavior since it's much easier to detect that a process went away with an error than detecting errors in log messages  but i can see the reasons not to  maybe terminating after a certain number of errors would be an option  but that's not what this issue is about 
sure  here it is    input data are regular applications logs   auth log    syslog    access log    error log  and the likes   which are successfully parsed by logstash 
so when you run "  plugin pack"  do all the dependencies get in to the tarball thats created  try this   install logstash output webhdfs or logstash output s3  while on a host that has internet    create the pack   plugin pack   untar the pack and look for those plugins and those plugin dependencies next  on the offline box  copy the plugin pack tar gz file over and install the pack  "  plugin unpack  pack  tar gz" then try a   plugin install   local logstash output s3 or webhdfs

 purbon when packaging a software for a specific system  it's considered best practice and good citizenship to conform to the "local" policy  that way  sysadmin who install the package are not surprised by unusual configuration of log conf bin … paths it also helps standard tooling support the package  for example logrotate  pid supervision  binary protections  configuration backup…  suyograo i was suspecting that this work would be underway for v5 but i didn't search enough  thanks for pointing to this guide 
the root disk filled up on all logstash nodes causing multiple services to stop working  including file completion in bash and compression of rotated logs  we will be disable log compression from now on  at the high speed errors can be generated  rotating and deleting uncompressed logs is at least guaranteed to work  whereas compression would fail to write to a full disk  there was also increased memory pressure at the same time  i believe from buffering oversized messages in memory  leading to processes dying and failing to restart as well as fork   and mmap   syscalls failing  but this was due to our configuration  not logstash 
unfortunately nothing  root server logstash # journalctl  u logstash service    logs begin at sun 2016 10 16 10 37 00 cest  end at thu 2016 11 10 22 07 09 cet     nov 10 22 07 09 37 97 136 10 colo transip net systemd 1   started lsb  starts logstash as a daemon    root 37 97 136 10 logstash # and no log file touched in  var log logstash got it working on another centos 7 install    so probably some other misconfiguration on this server  since release 5 0 is out now  i might try that one and see if that works
 untergeek control did return back to the console   bimalm thanks   i had other messages in the logstash plain log which were burying the errors  is the previous functionality available to be set via the config where if there is an error in the config it is displayed to the console rather than the log file  this would allow the issue to be presented in one location versus needing to check in another spot 
here is the ls config file pipeline batch size  2 pipeline batch delay  20 queue type  persisted queue max_events  0 queue max_bytes  2gb queue checkpoint acks  2024 queue checkpoint writes  2024 os that i am using is ubuntu 12 4 and i am just running one ls instance in the same box
logstash takes about 9   10 seconds to shutdown for me  i don't think waiting forever is a good idea though  so perhaps set it to 15 seconds to allow for a little more time 
hi jsvd  i am able to resolve this issues by following this link https   www elastic co blog logstash lessons handling duplicates thank you 
thanks 
just to clarify  plugins trying to do work on empty batches is the symptom  not the actual problem  what i observe is logstash doing work on empty event batches  passing them through the pipeline including any filter plugins  this is a waste of resources and that is  in my opinion  a problem  for a  completely idle pipeline  https   github com praseodym logstash filter multitest blob 65b6905ae6d9683e8cb1b66bbd00e39f08579082 pipeline http conf  i see 100 300  multi_filter  invocations per second  with logstash 5 6 3 consuming 5 40  of a cpu core doing exactly nothing 
nvm  thanksanyway   
hi  unfortunately that didn't work  i've looked at the ruby template for the logstash config and it appears that the module's listener is only instructing the netflow codec to handle v5 and v9 flow records  i guess this is more of a feature request than a bug 
i am using 6 1 3
no problem  thanks for working on it  we're hoping it solves some of our memory gc thrashing issues not having to convert to from rubystrings etc when calling our  java based  input receiver that causes connections to time out  ssl clients to die and a lot of other weirdness  my thinking was around being able to use the streaming api of jackson  i believe codecs also return a  map string  object     to avoid the extra  map  allocation that gets dropped when it gets converted to an  event  for the rest of the pipeline  there's also usecases like i described in #10350 with codecs that define  format s that  if they want to follow the same api contract when converted to java plugins  will need to allocate temp  event  objects to use  sprintf 
 jarpy what do you recommend as an alternative 
 jsvd i use neokylin operating system and cpu  mips64el   the source code of logstash does not seem to support mips64el
sure  i renamed 'satoshidice lessthan 48000' by adding an 'x' to the end of its label  
correct  typically you read shared libs and other files needed outside the jail  then you reduce privs  that most easily happens in process  same pattern as several other "reduced privileges after point x in program" security measures 
no change with an empty datadir  the only error that seems likely to mean anything relevant is this  error  fetchinputs     ecd2af2deb mempool tx prev not found ff6fe0fe69 error  ctxmempool  accept     fetchinputs failed ecd2af2deb then again  that may just be network debug stuff 
0 8 0  i tried deleting everything except wallet  no help 
i mean with keys in the keypool  when i try the gui requests i unlock the wallet
i deleted addr dat  this is the output now   i have an intel q9550 cpu  four cores  downclocked to 2 ghz  and my home folder is on an intel x 25m ssd  this was never a problem with versions before 0 4  the main window appeared instantly back then  blkindex dat is 254 7 mb in size 
right now i'm doing this in python  from jsonrpc import serviceproxy access   serviceproxy "http   127 0 0 1 8332"  pwd   raw_input "enter wallet passphrase  "  access walletpassphrase pwd  60  so all that shows up in my buffer is "walletunlock py" but it should be possible to simply run "bitcoind walletpassphrase" and have it prompt you to enter the passphrase rather than demand it as a command line argument  on mon  oct 3  2011 at 10 49 am  nils schneider   reply reply github com wrote

yes linux
i was thinking a gui option in bitcoin qt  does  datadir need to be specified with every run of the program  or does the setting get saved somewhere 
 marcofalke https   github com bitcoin bitcoin issues 9409 heads in the same direction  indeed this idea was inspired by reading the irc discussion  however  this proposes a particular feature where instead of querying a wallet for it 'pruned' state  instead you are querying a key if it has been associated with pruned transactions  just a natural extension i suppose 
i'm talking about the official 0 6 rc4 build  can you point me to the code or the  reg file that is used by the installer version for creating the protocol handler  it could well be  that my manual aproach  see above  is not perfect  as i took a mozilla how to as information source 
updated initial posting 
take a look at  walletview  createactions    for example  it's nearly identical to the stuff in bitcoingui cpp  and now even behind after #2428  try a diff and you'll see  and seems to be not used at all  because i have the new tab namings + that export stuff not working anymore 
if we soft set settings in optionsmodel  that will cause trouble with the networking related parameter interactions  think about  listen or  proxy for example    i stumbled upon this while looking into adding listen to the gui 
of course not

hmmm i will try  reindex    i was going to try and do a build from github but apparently the "build project in qt creator" step is missing some key parts because loading up qt creator and telling it to build would just say options were not configured  mixes   or something like that     sorry for repost this computer was signed into another account and i didnt realize it  
code has been rewritten  when i get to a computer i'll close this and put in a pull req  on apr 20  2014 6 16 am  "pieter wuille" notifications github com wrote 
i believe the behavior should default to only spending confirmed outputs  as suggested by deathandtaxes here  https   bitcointalk org index php topic 339802 msg3653378#msg3653378   a minconf optional parameter with either a default value of 0   to retain the existing behavior as default   or 1 to ensure that no unconfirmed outputs are ever used to create transactions when the "sendtoaddress" method is invoked  regardless of whether the transaction chain is being generated incestuously by outputs within your wallet  you may also wish to consider some of the additional recommendations proposed such as setting a min fee for all transactions as the default 
chris  i do  i installed beforehand via "brew install boost"  any other ideas 
bitcoin version 0 8 5 windows 7 64 bit it happen after reverted back to older amd graphic drivers at least ccc 11 1 and opencl 2 5  there is a possibility my system may have cause this  i will do a reformat and get back to you when the problem is the same  thanks 
i'm not very happy with the    notify options  i thought that you could access the ws mechanism by the same authority and add a path or scheme urn of "ws"  for example   i think the best way to implement ws support would be to use the    notify options as a fundament and build the ws as a layer on top of it  what do you think 
i believe it would be good to have a more elaborate specification  in a bip like format  why are there bip's  but the basic protocol is not codified  at any rate the old repo can be deleted then 
the crash seems to be easy reproducible  i just reproduced it on another machine with a similar configuration  the crash is in the main thread  but there are no symbol files  i'm not sure if the dump helps you much  are symbols available somewhere  the  debug log  https   0bin net paste swrzqddrlj+9ypx5#o ix5+q4yaolg38momrqfrrn4eq119rprmmmgbnlitg  has nothing interesting imho  below is the main thread call stack  bitcoin qt exe 0000000001c2535c   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000001c25e47   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000001c1481b   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000002086d54   unknown  external code  bitcoin qt exe 0000000000cb4532   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000000c7fb6c   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000000c747c4   unknown bitcoin qt exe 00000000020883ef   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000000c713b5   unknown bitcoin qt exe 0000000000c714c8   unknown  external code 
i don't know  i just read that bitcoin qt is now splitted up into an cli version and i think i have to change some small parts of my monit scripts    nothing big  but i have to spend some time   a 0 8 7 version i probably could just drop in    but thanks anyway for the informations   
this is the full config log  http   pastebin com ubcubcgv
i installed boost from brew install too  i think i have problem with the path  on my  bash_profile maybe   my coworker has the same osx version and he did not have this problem 
i installed boost via brew  1 55 0_2   i ran   configure   with boost  usr local cellar boost 1 55 0_2 to ensure this version of boost was used  i get the same error if i use the boost in  usr local include   not sure which version of boost that one is  
 jmcorgan  the main point where i think the c++ wrapper improves readability and robustness is through type safety and raii  instead of passing around  void   for the zmq context and socket  you have a typed object  e g   zmq  socket_t    and instead of manually calling an initialiser and a destructor for it  this is done by the language   including a guarantee that the destructor is called  which might be forgotten when using the pure c api  especially with things like multiple returns in a function or exceptions   if there is no longer a big reason not to depend on the c++ wrapper  then i can simply prepare a pr that changes to it and then we can judge based on that how much it simplifies the code  or not  
that's a clean build of openssl against which bitcoin is linked  it doesn't appear to be relevant  from further testing it looks like some sort of bizarre race condition in the boost test framework itself  if i pass    catch_system_errors no   which is supposed to make it dump core on a segfault  then the test passes  without it  when this defaults to yes  i get the segfault and core dump  a more verbose run is   since this is _probably_ a bug in boost rather than in bitcoin  and i have a workaround available  i don't really expect any further action  but i'm presenting it here just in case it _is_ a bug in the bitcoin tests and that isn't obvious to me for some reason 
i probably have run bitcond on clearnet before  so it is possible that someone knows my ipv6 address  however  shouldn't discover 0 preclude them from connecting to my node 
all tools installed with homebrew  here is  make  output  https   gist github com mikach a1951216c981c73a347d protobuf version  2 6 1 
the error is similar with kvm  added workaround in the issue devrandom gitian builder#84
os is windows7  bitcion qt and blockchain are on an 3tb usb drive  until this week it was working just fine  i am able to access al the data on the disk 
bitcoin conf prune 25000 i deleted the debug  i can try again if you think it should be working and it's on my end 
 laudaa that's what i meant 
i believe the rpc server is also holding on to old queried data as well since bitcoind is consuming a lot of memory on my machine which only happens when using it a lot    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 872832 8783040 2dd47dc4 2ece 11e5 9b5b f88cd1cd7a02 png 
tried 0 13 0rc1 and 0 13 0rc2  same problem it seems  below is error from my 0 13 0rc1 build attempt 
the problem is there's no libevent develop package for rhel 7 2 so i built one from source  i installed the epel rpm for libevent itself  but there's no devel rpm so i uninstalled and built everything from 2 02  iirc  source  maybe that's where the mismatch happened  unfortunately the docs are for fedora only so while i try to screw around with   configure parameters i couldn't make it work  maybe it'd be better to try with fedora rpms  i'll try that next

its not high cpu  my machine is idle  it seems to kick in after left running for some time  so i leave bitcoin qt running overnight  and come back the next day and i can no longer right click my desktop until i close bitcoin qt and reopen it  could it be io locking from network  my connection is not consistent  so frequently offline

nucleul bitcoin versiunea v0 11 0  32 bit  bitcoin core how many time need wait for this confirmation  why is so long  what need to do  how can have my bitcoin back or how long need to wait for confirmation now i have 3 days
there might be more implementation details to reconsider than a change for the data type of two variables  do you see the need for any more source code fine tuning for such an use case 
#7447 fixes my issue  more specifally  running  pkg_add openssl  and adding   i usr local include eopenssl   to cppflags worked 
uhh its 11 2 but i just updated still getting the same error only difference is it says line 1977 instead
yeah   conf   datadir  and  pid are teh params i want to “hard code” for the app bundle 
oups  thanks 
 fanquake it's a raspberry pi 3 so 1 gb of ram
no  only the regular "windows security" virus protection that's built in to windows 10  let me do some further testing on another machine and see if i can reproduce it and compare it to the offending machine 
fwiw  i've restarted the node multiple times now 
compiling with qt5 now   this is probably it  thanks for the quick response 
 laanwj thank you  i have write a program with boost lib and debug it successfull  this problem bothers me several days 
i have placed this file to depends folder but i still got same errors maybe i need somewhere to unpack this file  
v0 13 2  and gentoo linux  there was no such window visible  i was running bitcoind  not bitcoin qt 
yes  i believe this is an issue with latest wsl  it was working a week or so ago

here is a gdb session with the crash and backtrace  this is the current git  freshly compiled on openbsd 6 1 current amd64 
 laanwj i don't  static analysis only  in that case  perhaps an exception should be thrown in the calling code in case  chainactive tip    returns  nullptr   the condition in the  while  loop checks for  block    nullptr   hinting that this situation is possible 
 huhorler see #11526 for the instructions on how to acquire the visual studio solution and project files  they have only been submitted as a pull request at this stage so are not available in the main repository  if you just want to take a quick peek at them you can use the git command below from your bitcoin core repo   git pull origin pull 11526 head

 meshcollider thanks for your fast reply  actually i am a student and new at cryptocurrency development   beepmagnet is just a cryptocoin which i took to learn for making a window wallet like  exe   if i am going to build some other cryptocoin likewise in bitcoin also then also i face same problem   so can you help me please to find out a way to short out this kind of leveldb problem    
 jonasschnelli   at least a shared object i could do direct commands instead build a url in java for example   and don't need to always wait updates from who build java prc commands  make forks to update or just look to another one in git hub  you can use the same base in bitcoin cli but just make a sharedobject where can return commands in string json  well   you know what you could do  i just came here with a suggestion 
point taken  but i am running bitcoind and can edit the  conf file  some other threads such as the one below lead me to believe changing the   dbcache   level might help  however the strange part is it is only crashing upon reaching 100  sync  when memory usage should be much lower  https   github com bitcoin bitcoin issues 14345

unfortunately    but my solutions is to remove  fieds  array from  find     and it's usually helps 
 markstory i think the client should use the content length  if set in the response header  to determine the end of the message body 
this happened to me when i pulled data out of the db and passed some field values to __    the first argument happened to be null  the db allows null values as defaults   so it's not a matter of throwing notices and fixing my code  this only came to light because of a null value in my db  i know about the array signature  and that's what i switched to  but a null first argument still shouldn't negate the rest of the replacements  if the value is null  i'd expect the respective  s to be replaced with an empty string  from a api standpoint  i'd rather be forced to use the array   signature and be sure it's safe than having to test and "fix" my first argument before passing it to __   
yeah probably  but it is basically due to the new travis issues around https   travis ci org cakephp cakephp builds 31619305   thus i opened the ticket here 
if it cannot be handled by our testcase wrapper or by switching to a non erroring closure handling  then we might have to 
  auth_sandbox auth sandbox  vs expected   auth sandbox auth sandbox  same with all actions appended and with prefixing    admin auth_sandbox auth sandbox   vs expected   admin auth sandbox auth sandbox  
how would the dispatcher interaction work  for the controller and view we mainly need read access 
with the above requesthandler changes  the ajax view is called  and not overwritten by json view   but the view variables are not set as expected 
because those do not exist in that application  those are the plugins of the target application  the param name plugin itself does not warrant force loading plugins as in some scopes this is used for sth else  in this case only for path building 
prs for both fix  master   3 8  and enhancement  3 next   3 9  are open 
sounds both good at a first glance  not sure though if prepending only might cause trouble in some situations 
i've just choosen  count  as an example  there are many other aggregate functions that support keywords  see the linked docs   therefore i think a more generic solution would be reasonable 
i'm not quite sure  i guess ideally the signature wouldn't change too much  maybe this could be split into two methods  like  decimal  and  localizeddecimal   similarily to  time  and  localizedtime    so then in case it is deemed useful  it would be just a matter of fitting the optional places requirement in  maybe that could be a fourth argument  which however might not be overly nice given that passing  null  or  true  already determine things kinda similar  maybe a "polymorphic" signature could work  where   regex  accepts a boolean  which determines whether the check should be strict or relaxed  alternatively passing the places as array might even be an option too  something along the lines of   2  validation  relaxed    which i'm not really a fan of though 
use join model alias as key  like in cake 2 0  instead of '_joindata' in 4 0 or save join model alias inside of _joindata after feetching from db and check that alias inside belongstomany  _savelinks

 lorenzo because i can construct something like this   i hope you get it  and in article_single ctp i can define css file that has styles only for this part of layout  so if it is not used  page won't download unnecesary styles  but without   once   option the css file is included many times  one more  there must be something additional to do because with this modification in html code  lt link   gt  htmltag has   once   attribute 
thanks  problem was not the fixture written in error message but the old fixture left in plugin dir  though there was glitch related to unique key upgrade shell generates  resolved by upgrading old one as below and removing unnecessary constraints   probably it's better to fix or remove misleading path in error message   
it's yours  and my point itsn't that an exception _may_ be thrown  it's if it happens  a fatal error will be thrown instead with "maximum nesting" alert

i've never heard of that project before  but none the less  i just pulled that project in and added that number to the phone test case and it failed there too  as i mentioned  i'm still using cake 2 x  so i used localized 2 7 0

it should  but i have come up with a better approach that's likely to perform better when using apcu or apc    3 1 1     apciterator is supported in all versions of apcu and apc    3 1 1 
previously getpath created the following query   the problem with getpath test case might be that the data is created with  this  tree  initialize 2  2   which creates a data that is already in correct order by the id field  i'm not that familiar with numbertree model or other models used by the test case  so i cannot fix the test case right away 
for instance if you have multiple flags and want to get only a certain set of results  while it seems internally it could be handled with  a and not b  or  b and not a      no support on sqlite and sqlserver  closing 
 lorenzo   that's a good idea  while writing this ticket i also thought about differentiating  beforesave    and  aftersave    more into    updateeach    and  deleteeach    would then always trigger any callbacks  whereas  updateall    and  deleteall    would not

hey guys   php version 5 5 9 1ubuntu4 is the version  and thanks  markstory  'cachemetadata'    true has fixed the problem  hugely appreciated 
hey  markstory   yep  src controller admin userscontroller php exists    i assume you mean run 
tried that and the same issue occurs    think something strange is going on in github  the issue disappeared and is back now  you can ignore the new issue i just created   
thanks people  i've got composer to work  it turns out that i've to add some suffix to the composer update command   thanks 
 markstory yes  thus this issue is not directly related to the search plugin  for me the whole query string is being removed via links generated by  paginatiorhelper  sort     the only thing keeping are paginator related query string params  i did disable all search plugin things  prg component  model behavior  and ran this   thus the scoped part of the query string is discarded and only the parts relevant to the paginator are being kept  by paginatorhelper   whereas for the unscoped parts  and those set to another scope prefix  there is no such issue 
i looked at the list of updates  to 2 4  and have not seen i will test 
i think it has something to do with the size of our project  i added some  more  path to    exclude  and now it does finish

 markstory i commented in your  commit  https   github com cakephp cakephp commit 9dbeeaa1fa9e23042192eb1a033b526f4fd69003  
using shorter group names is quite inconvenient  using model names as group names makes it very easy to clear caches in appmodel in aftersave and afterdelete   this implementation is very close to what is recommended in the cookbook   https   book cakephp org 2 0 en core libraries caching html#using groups 
by lower level database api you mean bypassing cake completely 
yeah the  tagstranslations  table has the correct  defaultconnectionname   and it's definitely using the concrete table class  since i can override that specific  table  method with the full db+table path and it works  i removed everything from the  tables  themselves to make it easier to debug  and got it down to this    base table or view not found  1146 table 'videos games_translations' doesn u0027t exist" 
 markstory because i was curious  i ran it without params in root of git repository
isn't there already one on there  i was thinking something more in line with the ability to pass in temporary templates per call    would it be worth my time to make a pr for a trait that makes it easier to do per call template swapping  as i've been playing with 3 0 more and created my own helpers i would love to have a standard way to swap templates like the  formhelper  input     something that would temporarily overwrite templates  check for container templates  etc    oh  oops  i didn't notice  this  https   github com cakephp cakephp blob 3 0 src view helper formhelper php#l891 l899  addition to the templater  add load pop   that's what i mean  though  just the ability to have a new set of templates used for a single call on the paginatior  and across all the helpers  i suppose

in entitytraint is errors   method  which can get nested errors by _nestederrors  field  method  but ony one level  method _nestederrors  field  can't split  field name for now    post  errors 'user file filename'    may be not always correct  because post model can has many users  user model can has many files  then should be possible to get errors somethings like    post  errors 'users 0 files 0 filename'     also  there should be method which can get all available errors if they are  i personally create own entity method allerrors   which get all errors recursively  from entity fields and related entities

you are completely right
yes  here they are   but testing with these associations commented out just has the same problem    i checked  belongstomany  junction    with some debug echoes and all is setting up correctly  the jointable  contains  gets its two associations and the correct foreignkey  contained_article_id  for its  hasmany  assoc  childarticles    belongstomany  attachto    isn't even called 
sorry  i was to dumb to rtfm  the  conditions  option of  hasone    should be a simple array of where clauses and no function  i think i grabbed the function syntax from an answer from stackoverflow     so in this particular example  contain simply returned the correct value from the database without even using my  where  clause  because of this  the  matching    call couldn't know about it either    when defining the clause in the correct way in the table  all works without redefining the condition in the  matching    call 
 markstory i like your idea with  component    behavior   and helper    in the app configuration  all of these parent classes have  instanceconfigtrait   so we could merge the options in the trait  the hierarchy would be the following   defaultoptions      config app php      controller appcontroller php      options as parameter  if you like it  i will do a pr for this 
interesting  i tried it and i got an error   functionexpression  could not be converted to string  but now when i try it again it works  smile  i surely did somethig wrong  and i was looking on the description of  queryexpression    gt    and it says that   field  should be type of string so i assumed it work's only for database columns  anyway  the first thing with aliases is still good thing to have  so i don't need to write that function twice or use any additional "global" variable for that  but it is not a must  since the   query    where  function   exp   query   works  +1  so it is low priority i guess    not related to this topic    maybe the better thing would be  distinct on  also for ms sql  i saw it is not supported yet and it is not that easy to do   but it would be good for      join      where      distinct    speaking of  join    it would also be helpful if i could use     join    'model'     which would automatically join associated   belongsto   table and maybe     join    'model'    'left'     could specify the join method  but i'm not sure if it's wise to create another issue for that  i already feel bad for creating that many issues  confused 
mmm   i didn't understand the meaning of   maybeexistentquery   but by entering the iteration because of the if statement returning true  it makes an unnecessary select to the database   that results potentially in a lot of entities

i hadn't considered that  in fact i don't think i've ever instantiated an entity without using the table  ie     this  articles  newentity     only once so far to be honest  parsing the results that a very basic  searchcontroller  passes to the the view  depending on the context of what was requested  different tables are loaded  and a viewvariable  results  is passed down  to format the results  i wanted to generate urls and use each one's  displayfield  as the "anchor text" of the url  for some of them it's the  name  property  for others it's  id   and for others it might be say   username   so when iterating disparate entities in the results  i thought it would be handy if i could just do       this  html  link  entity  displayfield                   or something like that  does that make sense 
 ad7six the migration file has  binary   here it is 
nothing fancy ie  this gives me same result

hi update on the problem  it seems i made a mistake in routes php file for added the resources  i had put the setresources for each of the controllers in the wrong place or so it seems 
is this what you mean 
i'm using a generic medias table that is used by others model so i try not to touch it and keep it generic  that's why i keep the foreign key on the "calling" table  stack trace    gives the same result  and same value in field  1   only working way is to give a different property name 
it's a plugin so here's my table code 
 markstory it's friends are in there "ajax"  "json" and "xml"  jquery allow you to send  xml  json  script  or html  they treat it as an equal  feels like it's missing  i'm hoping other people feel the same way   admad it's used in many frameworks and i've seen this technique used in cake and blogged about since 1 3  you are both right that cake makes what i'm doing pretty darn easy and maybe it's just me  d
alright  created the pull request 
yes  but my solution has three foreach loops nested    not the nicest one   
thx  i don't know how to use this acl plugin  can you write a detailed tutorial  thank you too much  
i didn't even opened the config folder  i just installed the cakephp 3 from the composer and that was it  my bootstrap php is exactly like that 
no this do not work  i have made this little modification in lib cake utility inflector php#389    that do the job   hope that help
yes you could reproduce this by requesting any action that requires authentication with ajax and no ajaxlogin configured in authcomponent  i tried writing a test for this but couldn't work out how to simulate the ajax request 
yeah that makes a lot more sense  touches far less things  shall i submit a pull request 
no  technically no form was created  the javascript is just serializing all the inputs i've dynamically created that are checked  and submitting them as data  the inputs are not inside a form  and the button is not a submit button  according to fiddler  the only data is in the form of  inputname inputvalue  
no relation between the calling of to array   and json  just that i want my json with only arrays  may i ask why then  the  query  first    toarray returns the internal variables as an array 
i'm using cakephp 3 1 4  using it for a webservice  https   github com qarox cakephp nsapi blob master src webservice driver nsapi php https   github com qarox cakephp nsapi blob master src webservice stationswebservice php here is a small example what i'm doing  without the 'accept encoding' header the server sends the response in chunks 
of course  i removed the useless code  like classes and other non input elements  my form is using a form template located in   config app_form php      input declaration  
well  i'm not sure where to look further  it just doesn't go into the "layout" nor "view" files at that point  anything else i should check for  or data dump i should dig out  edit  in my unit test  i get this   edit2  the  get    being referenced is the  viewblock  get    method  being called from  view  fetch   
 markstory i originally didn't use  virtual   but i added it in after to see if it would fix it
for example after i generate below link by paginator helper  that was ignore request query "sort time"   single predict page 2 sort time
i was trying to use extract from a result set  from some associated tables  actually  something like   there are timestamp fields in all of these tables  and those seem to be causing the problem  update  i wasn't sure if i could use the  _  twice  so i tried to extract from  other_model  _  field   which gave the same error  edit  i just saw your reply  sure i'll get back to you 
i think for a hasone it should be deleted by default  but have an option to override  however this behaviour should be consistent with hasmany associations to avoid confusion 
hope this will help to resolve the issue  _note  spl_object_hash   returns the same value for both_
no problems  strangely enough i can't seem to get a test case that fails on the current code  even though i'm seeing the effects in a running app  i'll dig in and pr as soon as i have all the parts together 
no  as far as i understand  any idea how to check it  i have pretty much just default xampp installation 
3 1
correct sorting on the choosen key  like this for descending    array        here it was sorted on the 'extra' key with values descending  elements without the 'extra' key have a 'null' value  so they were added at the bottom  for ascending directions the elements without the 'extra' key would be the first after sorting 
 saeideng i don't use custom route class  i use built in  dashedroute  class   markstory  _method  become an array because    i call this method    setmethods  'get'  'post'    in  routes php   it will set default method to an array   'get'  'post'      i don't provide the  _method  option when calling  url  build     i don't provide it because i use named route  that what i expect is only need to pass the  _name  option    at this line  https   github com cakephp cakephp blob 3 5 6 src routing routecollection php#l316 will use default  _method  which is an array  here is var_dump output of   route  defaults 
nope  composed new cakephp project and did what mentioned above 
no but i do have a  beforevalidate    
they are simple strings  but i set them more clearly  controller   this  set 'category' 'alkoholos italok'    this  set 'subcategory' 'sor'    view    php echo  this  form  create 'product'  'type'  'get' 'url'   'controller'  'products' 'action'  'index'  category  subcategory         and the result is the above mentioned issue 
none of these codes is the problem  since i now have simply install version 3 3 and add a media plugin that contains assets in its webroot    here is the error      screenshot  https   i gyazo com e4277a3fd7c970e28d4064958aa97e9b png  the app min js is in  plugins media webroot js app min js 
i didn't even think about that     i will look into that soon  thanks for the feedback 
it works without the error 
ahhh this is why     it's odd though it actually worked to allow 'add' in the cases where it was singular   shrug  oh well  changing it did fix my stuff 
 admad i have done support in my project  in fact  i have expanded a lot of features include di and this    i just want cake core can support parsing   env  by default 
 lorenzo i did not realize that the format of the timezone was wrong   and i had not met the similar problem
lorna mitchell has a pr for the nexmo sdk here https   github com nexmo nexmo php pull 175 and michael heap asked her if that pr should allow version  2 0 as well  so nexmo's aware of the issue and i don't think the cakephp dependency version needs to be relaxed  perhaps we should flag the 1 x vs  2 x diactoros change in the release notes or migration guide  from my standpoint this issue can be closed   nexmo is aware that at least one framework has moved up to requiring diactoros  2 0

 josegonzalez i mentioned it on  platform and target  section  1 4 29 
no  i did not update with the intention to use the psr7 application class  to be honest i am just reading up on the psr 7 related changes in cakephp 3 3  i don't yet see  how this could have something to do with this problem 
i am running  php 7 1 2 4+deb sury org trusty+1  cli   built  mar 2 2017 13 23 06    nts

 markstory well  i have some ideas  1  app php with "tables"  with throw exception for repetitions  
for future visitors  yes  "i am paginating the same model more than once"  and it seems to be working fine when i change the model alias  thanks

hi  markstory thanks for your answer  i haven't custom aro class  this is my  app models aro php  thanks in advanced 
it seems to be random  i would have thought it would return it in alphanumeric order by default  e g  07 jpg 04 jpg 09 jpg etc 
i can try  but i am total beginner with cakephp 
mh   i'm not sure if there is any need for maintaining compatibility to prior versions  people who do not have that issue with session sharing should not be effected by a change  the worst thing that could happen is that a users is logged out after a version update of cake  afterwards it should work as before for "standalone" usage and better if you try something like this     and i assume that could be helpful for people who upgrade larger systems 
my application is default  no additional packages  this error sometimes happens  sometimes not  every time while submitting a form  my forms are completely created using the documentation recommendations  this error started happening after i upgraded from 3 5 x to 3 6 3  i updated composer json based on an application i already started using op 3 6 x
 lorenzo i removed it  but i have another behavior in my  tagstable    countercache   and this behavior was "activated" even i didn't add or modify any new  tag  entity  my db user doesn't have the grant to update the field that  countercache  needs  besides  i use this same configuration  with joindata  in another part of my application that needs the  timestamp  behavior  i think that  _joindata are unnecessary updating the  tag entity 
yes that was the first thing that i tried  but since the password field is being hidden by default it kinda creeped me out to remove it  since it's basically a second password  of course digestauthenticate unsets the field but in all other parts the user object will have it  not trying to pretend to be an expert here 
the below is what i'm trying to do  quite possibly matching is not the right approach  the or below is what i mean by ormatching  i realize this would cause duplicates article ids  so one would have to add  manually  via distinct    group by a id

hello  markstory i will try again this today with this tips that you guys gave me  and yes i have an example of how rails work to make a really ease ajax development  you can downdload this project https   github com andrelzgava demo this is a very simple project demonstrating of how to make ajax in rails  i just have done a scaffold  bake  in books and made some changes to make work with ajax and this was "ready" in functionallity in just 30 minutes  if you have any doubt feel free to ask  and i will explain how this works  d
no wasn't  when u said i searched in documentation and found to set  this  request  trustproxy   true  i should do it before calling function or there is a specific place to put it  i put code inside a function that should get the user login  tried localy and didnt work  tried on server didn't work too   server is behind proxy

no  and sorry about report cakephp version is   must be 3 6 14   i just upgrade cakephp version to 3 6 15 after the project has an error  2019 08 17  #### last upgrade result
basically i did this  used 3 5 11   1  baked normally from migration file as "tasks" table  id  some fields etc  created  modified  2  baked model  controller and templates 3  edited taskstable with new public function xxxxxx   4  baked shell named gettasksshell 5  added initialize   and  this  loadmodel 'tasks'   to shell 6  used  result    this  tasks  xxxxxx    in shell main   function 7  informed that model function that i created not found 8  baked same migration file with "mytasks" and did same thing  mytasks instead of tasks  and it worked instantly  i even debug  this  tasks   in shell and it wasn't same as normally would maybe i did something wrong at the beginning and with redoing with mytasks i didn't

after some tests  i'm not sure that cakephp is the problem  i think that cakedc search is doing something that cake can't handle  anyway  i personally fixed my bug 
i have   via  php  i 
the result is "url chelsea wolfe juz za 2 tygodnie na jedynym koncercie w polsce 51586 html" but i guess it should be empty string  i have no rewriting on web server  the router configuration beside cake standard   for this url is    routes  connect '  slug  id suffix'   'controller'    'news'  'action'    'view'    '_name'    'news'  'pass'     'id'  'slug'  'suffix'   'id'    ' 0 9 +'  'suffix'    ' html'    
great question  when i first tried that it didn't work    but that's because i had a typo in my closing tag  it does work as you suggest  so no need for this i guess 
yes  i have cleared all cache 
if there's method to use its  both of  function  and  expression  are ok 
yes  they do  but constraint violation is only a safety measure and should not be relied on  the problem is that we ignore results of checks done by application rules and could not inform user with some meaningful error description  what we get instead is a database error and application crash because of constraint violation  in dependentdeletehelper php function cascadedelete   always returns true  it should return false if not all associated entities were deleted  and code that calls cascadedelete   should abort transaction if delete fails 
how about you try to use the northwind sample database  https   github com jpwhite3 northwind sqlite3 blob master northwind_small sqlite i just tried it for customers table and got the same result  the only thing that changed are those two lines and adding the file 
yes  it seems to be related   abstract interp cpp  compiled fine with 4 8  now at 60  of the build  
this looks suspiciously bogus  as actually it's showing the full code line rather than just what was being unserialized  looking in builtin_functions cpp it seems to me a true error would actually return just the serialized data  so likely this is my fault and not an php bug at all   so if you agree please close  however if it is a real bug  i just tested and the data did unserialize in zend php 
afraid i don't have time to try and narrow it down at the moment  but i would test with huge  like 100mb  data values of objects that contain nested massively arrays and see if that triggers a problem  it's definitely not a concurrency problem as it happens on 2nd request always 
the intention of this option would be to preserve the original usage and suppress the hiphop specific arguments  therefore  you wouldn't be able to pass hiphop specific arguments  a wrapper would work  but would complicate the usage in a different way  ideally  the compiled program should stand alone 
hi  i tried to make a very small project to reproduce this bug with no success  so i did another test  i changed the order of properties in the definition within the class code  happened what i expected  the error moved to another property  the final workaround for this problem was to change all static private properties to protected  in this particular class  and all works fine in the hiphop binary  strange is that there are many classes with private static properties in my codebase which had no problem at all  thanks for your great work on hiphop  we're using it to serve web content for 18 million unique users per month with fantastic results in comparison to apache  thanks to hiphop we have much more free ram  lower load  much better response times     keep it up   cheers  lubos

hi scott  libxml 2 6 26 2 1 2 8 el5_5 1
what do you mean 
a local dns cache resolver does not solve the thread contention problem present on the libc  we use pdnsd  and it obviously helps  but more at a network level  to avoid our internal dns server to be continuously hit by the same requests  you can even populate your hosts file with your most frequent resolved hostnames  and you still reach thread contention with enough dns resolutions   threads  because only one thread could be on the critical section 
the package is not a git archive  probably i need to try pulling the source from git and build it  lemme see how it goes with regular route 
the project of php code is others  i can not modify their source php code  they used __autoload function in php  so i must modify the behavior of implement of __autoload in hhvm

i am running version from april 1  it has stacktrace  enabled   true  how do i get the php stack  or do i need to update to latest version from master branch  thanks 
 danslo actully i dont know i am new to linux i had followed a link to install the nginx and hhvm coul'd you provide me a configuration example for both nginx and hhvm+nginx i am totally confused in this and this is the last step to rum my server thanks in advance
thanks for giving an hint  it is working now for me 
 jwatzman just found this inconsistency while trying samples for php on 3v4l org  i dont have hhvm running on my dev box 
i've tried hhvm nightly dbg  stacktrace is empty  at  tmp  syslog only supplies 
no  always show  could not allocate 1209565183 bytes for translation cache   and i used code   eval   jitasize   256    20 # 256mb jitastubssize   256    20 # 256mb jitglobaldatasize   jitasize    2 # 64mb   when i try   hhvm  m daemon  u ubuntu  c hhvm hdf show this alert 
seems okay after removing that file  i'll keep an eye on it   i set php fpm as a fallback in case hhvm crashes again  is it possible something corrupted the  hhvm hhbc  file somehow  edit  i completely turned off hhvm since i'm experiencing slow page loads and high cpu usage  i'm still using it for one single site so i'll let you know if i see it again for that site  i guess it's unlikely since it gets a small amount of traffic compared to the other sites on the same server 
thanks for resolving     next time i compile the actual version i ll give it a try    
i'll try it out later today or tomorrow and let you know  thanks for checking into it so quickly 
 scannell that's a debug version already  but it's not so simple to reproduct the crach  i'll try to

ptarjan  sure  what is pr     
i was setting this in  etc hhvm php ini  so this is probably why  i've tested using your examples above and the files are still being created  but they are at least empty now  hiphop vm 3 0 1  rel  compiler  tags hhvm 3 0 1 0 g1da451b79f40686de6472d23cf90fdd09fa4dc23 repo schema  11f0d546efba889ced1f9b92d9c9249f494d0b84
to reproduce it all i had to do was to launch my code  i don't have a distinct  small  testcase at this time  the code was dying almost immediately with the assert error  there were other hhvm's running at this time  i'm still trying to see if this was an out of memory situation  i have the oom killer taking out another hhvm process but the lwp pid doesn't match the pid of the hhvm killed by the kernel  i will see if this was a one off with low memory or if it's persistent  are there any debugging flags i can enable to help determine what's happening 
it occurred at make time   
yes  it works as same as mod_php under php fpm
 joelmarcey i'm not really sure how i can go about that as the crashes are not happening at any consistent point  but at seemingly random points  the only consistency is the hphp  stringdata  releasedataslowpath   method that's crashing  i'm not sure if it's relevant but the perf map files that sit alongside the stacktraces  in each one that i've looked at or compared to the stacktraces are  for the most part showing completely unrelated bits of code  from crash to crash  at the point of the faults   jo con el both of the servers that this is happening on are ubuntu vps's running 14 04  nginx 1 6 3 and wordpress  with hhvm installed via apt get  both were running 3 2 0 in production without problems and immediately started crashing once hhvm was upgraded to 3 3 0  in both cases i've had to rollback hhvm 3 2 0 because hhvm will not stay alive longer than 3 4 page requests 
 fredemmott do i just set  hhvm log native_stack_trace   true  and wait for the next crash happen  or i need to have  hhvm dbg  installed 
sorry i am not able to reproduce it with a script  i tried   it seems it happens after random number of requests 
thanks all – ideally php and hhvm would behave consistently  but yes i'd agree that php's behavior may not be intentional or correct  opening a bug against php5 sounds reasonable   dmitrysoshnikov i don't know of any case where you would want to encode a closure and get anything meaningful back when you decode it  but i ran into this because there happened to be a closure mixed into the content i actually cared about  one interesting comparison with javascript and php here 
only if you'll take the innitiative  i'm very sure  its not difficult at all for the one who wrote that documentation for the first time

it's certainly unclear to me  i just know that it does   
the list could be shortened by allowing the annotation to include a super type of all of the exceptions that could be thrown  i would also think that a single function that is able to throw a plethora of exception types would be a code smell  if there are that many ways in which a single function can fail  it sounds like that function is trying to do too much  i could be wrong about that though    if you do have some glue code that doesn't handle exceptions  yet   you could declare    __throws  exception  class     which would cover any possibility  or there could be a short cut    __throws    which means the same thing  maybe my architecture design is wrong  but i usually have many layers of error handling  when consuming a service or library  i almost always wrap calls into the api in try catch blocks  i then wrap the library's exceptions with my own  or decide at the call point how to handle the exceptional case  this way each 'error boundary' is specialized to the particular task at hand  when designing a system as a collection of specialized modules  each module should have a limited number of ways in which it can fail  thus the number of exception types that an individual module is able to throw should be limited  additionally  the exceptions that a module throws to the consumer should live close to that boundary  i would like a library i use to attempt as much as possible to handle any exceptions it runs across  or at least logically group individual exceptional cases  the central code that calls into each of the modules must thus be able to handle many different types of exceptions  but i would want combine different exception types into abstract groups  then the top layer only needs to know about the groups of exceptions rather than all of the different types  i see two ways of doing this  having the modules extend your glue codes' exceptions  if the modules are for internal use only  or to have your glue code wrap the modules' exceptions  by catching them then throwing a different exception   as an example  say my system allows a user to use facebook  google+ or twitter to log in  i create a service class to handle all three ways of logging in  this service class calls into the sdks to communicate with the respective web apis  each time my service class calls an external service  i wrap that call with a try catch block  on an exception i then throw  loginexception   this way my central system doesn't need care which login service threw the original exception  i would never allow the sdk exception to bubble up to the code that glues all my services together  the same would go for one internal service that i wrote consuming another internal service that i wrote  the code consuming the service should decide what should happen if that service fails  if service a consumes service b and service b fails  service a should explicitly decide what to do about it  even if that decision is to pass it on to the consumer of service a  as a library consumer  it would be nice for the type checker to warn me about exceptions i'm not explicitly handling  as it stands now  either excellent up to date documentation must exist that tells me what types of exceptions could be thrown from each entry point into the library  or i need to sift through the code to see what could be thrown from that call site  even then i'm not sure i would be able to find all of the indirect ways a particular api call could throw an exception

unfortunately i don't know  we're just using phing and noted the incompatibility when setting up tests with hhvm

 jwatzman i am on linux mint 17  used the  deb http   dl hhvm com ubuntu trusty main  repo for installing hhvm  i had seen   hhvm hhbc  inside my home dir  so i believe this is the default location  or is it some other directory  i am going to test on ubuntu server with a fresh install and come back with the observations 
hello  thanks for the comment  i have to say that i am no more able to reproduce     even after cloning fresh project  so might be a problem from myself    in every case  the problem i had was that i got an error such as "lber_librairies" defined as "not_found" 
if i compile libglog myself with 4 9  and link with that  after removing the debian package for it   this error goes away  however  the final linking of "cxx executable hhvm" now fails  i suspect for similar reasons  because of boost 
yes the problem is only the charset 
was fixed in https   github com facebook hhvm commit 25c12df80e929b286bc72556d8f346ee835e097a
 photodude  craigcarnell if this is caused by what  orvid suggested  i suspect it affects joomla and magento as well  but we haven't run any benchmarks 
https   3v4l org 6bhj5 perf#tabs but i was testing both warmed up and cold on own machine  there are frameworks based on the use require_once statement  such constructs can be used many times  i suppose that it is necessary to pay attention to the design  perhaps there's just some piece misunderstanding 
 lexidor ah  i've got to say it's slightly consoling to know i wasn't alone  it's a direct dependency to hhast which is depended on by many others  including hacktest  but  if you just upgrade your packages it should go away because difflib ≥v1 1 1 has  changed  instanceof  over to  is   https   github com hhvm difflib commit cd9e9c60a17d7d1d7f09fb1dbb1315f40c521a66#diff 467ea4a798f30edf34e2eab92d8515d6l48

yes  you are correct  provided there is a version check in the code before trying to invoke java 7 method
if you split out channel core  layout could be like this 
definitely agree that i need the clinker repository in order to download the snapshots  about settings xml    i don't actually have one configured  there is nothing in my    m2 directory  and the settings xml file in maven_home conf directory doesn't mention sonatype at all    trustin   could clinker be mirroring the sonatype repository  i could send you the example maven project i have if you want to try it locally as well 
i didn't knew that we could actually "readutf" by doing the following   bytebuf bb        charsetutil getdecoder charsetutil utf_8  decode bb niobuffer     if possible  we could implement first the bytebuf  readutf   and bytebuf  readascii   method by delegating to the charsetutil or charseten decoder  and then  later  revisit the en decoding process with a different approach  that said  more performance is always welcome  especially in that kind of processing   
well  basically one has to write httpchunk responses to the browser over the spdy pipeline  aggregating the chunks first and writing a single large response works well  not sure why chunked output would be an issue    
sorry for the pause  i did some tests  linux windows   i also upgraded java to 1 7 0 6 but i didn't found any difference  the problem is related to the connection of channel  this problem appears with an exception thrown by the method sendrequest   in the clienttester java file because the channelfuture isn't marked as success  actually  this issue only appears on windows  this simple test isn't running correctly on windows with netty version   3 5 3  but is ok with linux for netty    3 5 3 i'm sorry  i don't have time to find the reasons of this issue  2012 8 25 norman maurer notifications github com ## jean vincent leroy

yes  you need to create a directbytebuffer to read the data  but the problem is that garbage collector doesn't clean the memory allocated to the bytebuffer  so  if you have some connections  the memory of application goes increase until java lang outofmemoryerror exception  on my test  i has a server that received various client connection that establish connection  sending a message  and close the connection  and i saw this out of memory http   stackoverflow com questions 1854398 how to garbage collect a direct buffer java a direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the allocatedirect factory method of this class  the buffers returned by this method typically have somewhat higher allocation and deallocation costs than non direct buffers  the contents of direct buffers may reside outside of the normal garbage collected heap  and so their impact upon the memory footprint of an application might not be obvious  it is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated primarily for large  long lived buffers that are subject to the underlying system's native i o operations  in general it is best to allocate direct buffers only when they yield a measureable gain in program performance  source  http   docs oracle com javase 1 5 0 docs api java nio bytebuffer html  what do you think

we use your buffer pool abstraction for a large number of internal representations beyond just socket io  drill is a distributed query engine that keeps all data off heap in a columnar representation inside bytebufs  out internal representations are shared between c++ and java code  as a distributed hadoop application  our target platform is intel so it is our preference to use little endian data  you can see our fork here  https   github com apache incubator drill tree master exec bufferl src main java io netty buffer
sure  
i am having serious issues with autoread and  bytetomessagedecoder   i have not figured out the issues so i am hesitant to suggest a fix  the issue is confounding enough that i put that enhancement on hold for now  what i can add to this is that i'm i always using autoread   false and so  in that case  i am able to get thousands of messages to work with the proposed changes  however  when i try to add my own decoder  subclass of  bytetomessagedecoder   processing gets very very mixed up  probably because i'm trying to use single decode as well as no auto read   lw346   it did seem to work for me  but i wasn't flipping autoread  i think for me the issue was that  channelreadcomplete  in  sslhandler  was always adding a  read  when autoread was false and  firechannelreadcomplete  as you point out was always adding a  read  when autoread was true  so my initial issue was that i could not turn off autoread when using ssl

maybe a deprecation strategy like  guava's  https   github com google guava wiki philosophyexplained#iteration  would be reasonable  this particular abi change was fairly unnecessary in my opinion  but i can see how  some  deprecation system is needed 
 normanmaurer    have i written a null by any chance under some weird condition 
well whether replacing most copy  s with slice   is a premature optimization is an another topic  but what i mean by copy is  well  i forgot to mention that i am not using directly copy     here's the "copy" as copy   would also use unpooled buffers or something like that  so using slices avoids memory copies at frame decoder level but would come at a cost of trashing the memory with garbage as there is no pooling  for each single packet read  garbage  and i worked quite hard to pool everything so that the number of garbage it creates during i o is an exact 0  imo that's the behaviour we could use  1  creating a new derived buffer increases refcnt on the original 2  the derived one maintains its own refcnt starting on 1 and calling retain   on derived would not touch the refcnt on the original 2  if release   is called on derived  the "own refcnt" is decreased  if "own refcnt" is zero  decrease the "original's refcnt" by one  also recycle 3  the user needs to make sure he calls slice release   so that the original would also be released at some point  but this makes me wonder if that would break buf slice   copy   since it would start leaking the original buffer     but i think that could break things   we need to think about it again knowing that the slices are usually made out of the input stream  i wouldn't go the slice collection route for the same reasons you mentioned 
yes  it was surprise for us  but with 30000 qps and unsafe code we have 50  cpu usage  with no unsafe we archive same cpu load with 60000 qps  it is hard to share reproducer  it is very specific for us  i can try to create something similar  but we very limited in time 
it is not about order  netty is not following 3 4 state tcp protocol after sending tls alert  it should not terminate the connection with tcp rst instead it should do gracefully with tcp fin 
i have deal with this problem，use maven 3 3 9 maven project problem
 windie there is also the same problem with 4 1 0 cr7 in the aforementioned computer  it's really difficult for me to make sure what in the computer causes the bug  do you have any idea 
thanks for the quick response  here's a little more about our use case as background  we're extending nioeventloopgroup with code below  our goal is to catch basic coding errors in tasks we submit to the eventloopgroup and get them into our logging framework  basic but unfortunately still common things like nullpointerexceptions    we also override the rest of the schedule and invoke methods with similar calls to decorate  if there is a better way to log all errors in submitted tasks then we can alter our code appropriately

hi  maseev   yes i do it intentional   since there is an scene   for example   the channel will try to get data source from remote server async   but it will take more time   such as 1 minute for one http request   it take 60 seconds   it is ok   but other request take 60_2  120 second   and other take 60_3  180 seconds   so   it is the question   i just debug the helloworld demo   the default_event_loop_threads is 8 i use postman to do the demo   and i tried to send 12 requests with in 10 seconds   and for the first 6 requests   it take 60 seconds   and other take 120 seconds 
http   stackoverflow com questions 29093144 slf4j decorator is logging the decorator fqcn not the calling fqcn i saw the source code of netty logging package  maybe this problem  because of fqcn  log only show decorator class line number  not the invoking class    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1432613 18422528 07024716 78cf 11e6 8819 04fd605534f5 png 
the encoding for the payload of the mqttpublishmessage uses a bytebuf and it's right because the payload of a published mqtt message  publish  must be considered as something binary  not necessary printable characters like for a string   for the same reason the will message inside connect should be something binary  when the mqtt broker has to send the will message  it builds a publish message and in this case putting the will message into a binary payload  why restricting the will payload to be a string  
 normanmaurer yes it is comping now  thanks for the prompt help  
i like the idea of the metrics being push not pull  in this particular case  how would one bind for the push events  given that the encoder and decoder are essentially hidden  spring has an implementation of this which is pseudo pub sub  listeners register via the eventlistener interface  and event publishers are registered via the applicationeventpublisher interface  what's nice is that it allows for multiple event receivers  http   docs spring io spring docs current javadoc api org springframework context event eventlistener html http   docs spring io spring docs current javadoc api org springframework context applicationeventpublisher html this is likely way too heavy for netty  but conceptually it provide a nice decoupling of publisher and consumer 
yes  but this exception throws in main ui thread and app will exit  "collapse" is means “crash”。 thank you answer my question。
 md 5 as we have very high tps  80k per sec  so we have handled this way  suggest if there is any better way of doing with netty or something else  stacktrace of exception    java io ioexception  broken pipe  
i also used one boss thread  so you mean the reason is due to boss thread is not enough  but i think no matter what happens  no matter what configuration you take  the api should go smoothly every request should have an end to tell final phased result    final success or connection failed or half failed 
can i point to stackoverflow for reproducer  code from the orginal  post  https   stackoverflow com questions 41463493 netty serverbootstrap option or childoption and its buffer size impact on speed  1  take "objectechoserverhandler java" and "objectechoserver java" 2  use the following 'args' parameters   "sendtoclient"  "option"  "1"  transport type nio network transport type tcp
 normanmaurer will do this when this happens again
yeah  it's good with 4 1 16 final  thanks 
 normanmaurer there is a custom classloader loaded script  if script creates a pooledbytebuf  it may trigger the creation of a thread  reference threaddeathwatcher's schedule method  and then the script of this classloader is not recyclable  because the netty thread does not change before the jvm closes  the hot update system creates new classloader at any time  finally  memory leaks occur in the thermal update system 
 normanmaurer hey  sorry for the long delay  had some unexpected medical issues that kept me offline for a while  looking online  it appears that the specific runtime issue that i encountered was due to some maven versioning conflicts causing an error when loading the child class  i wish i could give you a code sample  but i don't have the bandwidth right now to reconstruct our codebase from two weeks ago  my comment was less to the actual runtime error  however  and more to the pattern  calling some non immutable method via a constructor is not guaranteed to be error free  i was a bit hasty in typing this out  so that statement is not correct  however  i should say
i'll try to get an example soon  i'm on call at work so i don't have much time  but maybe once i've finished my rotation 
sorry  did you mean to say "use nioeventloopgroup  " instead  anyway  i tried without thread and with thread and the result is the same  the usedmemory keep going up as soon as outofdirectmemory is hit 
thanks   normanmaurer  i created a pr 
the server endpoints are written in cpp  i am not able to provide them  in my case  everything runs good with netty 4 0 56  but failed with "connection reset by peer" exception while trying to call writeandflush   after upgrade to 4 1 36 i dont change any codes  except the version  the only difference i can tell is the localaddress of channels  and the connect part seems ok i'll try provide the client code later
 qeesung how do i make sure that both threads set up here are working  i found that only one thread is working through source debugging   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 13413715 60397009 df871c80 9b7a 11e9 9dbb bebf2b5b260e png 
 normanmaurer maybe it's not good enough for me to describe  although an application can create multiple server channels  it is definitely not a lot of concurrent creation  so there is no need to use static fields to store   selectorprovider    because static fields themselves need to occupy memory  even though this memory occupied very small  but when the application is started    selectorprovider   is no longer used for   nioserversocketchannel   but it will always occupy memory  i personally think it is a waste of resources 
i think this could be done using some interfaces  custom implementations  as required  can be added to various eventloops and eventloopgroups or their superclasses  users can decide while server bootstrapping if they want to observe those counters or not

i want to deal with objects   
can you tell me how to do schema validation  i can certainly add the reproducible test case  thanks for quick response 
actually  i need the complete invoice object but only the id fields of related 
i need the data from the other table but is not necessary for me to have results converted into object  it is just to export as csv xml file format     i guess the hydration is unnecessary in my case but i don't know the appropriate method to iterate my sql dql request  400 000 rows 
this is the stack trace  
 ocramius no you are right   i don't add any custom mappings  but when debugging i found out that changing   rsm   new resultsetmapping     into   rsm    countquery  getresultmapping    seemed to be fixing the problem  but that's not possible since the getresultmapping method is protected  i've made an example below https   gist github com nikolajlovenhardt dcaee906027a57e8bb0ee4f8f29c8816
i see  i'm running an outdated version then   "name"  "doctrine common" "version"  "v2 6 2"   is it possible to run the new version  whilst still using symfony 
 ocramius hi   entity  getclassname   just return classname of entity simply using  return  string get_class  this    which returns  cds  library  mysql  entity  cdsdomain  regarding   "when will use"   wanted to say that problem happens when method   orderby   gets as a  sort parameter strng which contains classname with namespace  cds  library  mysql  entity  cdsdomain  instead of a simple string like  cdsdomain   i will prepare a simple entities and service to show the problem and will share a link here 
thanks for taking the time to comment on this  much appreciated    it's this that i suspected  but couldn't find explicitly mentioned in the docs  perhaps doctrine could error when defining an entity like this if it is truly unsupported  as far as i can tell  using joined table inheritance would still render me unable to make use of the scalar value if that field is also used for the join  also  in this example an  attendee  may exist  who does not inherit from a  member   so it doesn't seem like joined table inheritance at would work here  the only solution i can think of would be to join the entities outside of doctrine's automatic associations  thanks 
 ocramius with dbal i am getting the results  i am using freetds on ubuntu 14 04 
hi ocramius  thanks for your quick reply  1  the error can be triggered by simply calling   this  repository  find  id     the repository being used the the repository of the abstracproduct  but we've also tried using the repo from the abstractline  top level  and the outputorientedproduct  the concrete leaf  and that yields the same results  2  i'm pretty sure it cannot be a wrong discriminator value  the way we tested this was to have a valid record in the database  so without the parent_id   this record can be queried like said in bullet '1'  everything works fine  we get an instance of an 'outputorientedproduct 'entity  after manually inserting a parent_id  and changing nothing else  executing the same code results in the 500  3  the reason i did not include a trace is because the trace didn't have much more info  but i'll include it at the bottom  4  i don't really know what you mean with test case  but i can't make a unit test for our code logic  since all we do is calling find   in the repo  i didn't dive in the doctrine code as well so no  i can not repro this in a test case  trace 
i'd be happy to provide a documentation patch  for version 2 8 or 2 7 
  composer why not doctrine instantiator 1 0 1 jms serializer dev master requires doctrine instantiator   1 0 3  phpspec prophecy dev master requires doctrine instantiator   1 0 2  phpunit phpunit mock objects 3 4 x dev requires doctrine instantiator   1 0 2  doctrine instantiator 1 0 1 requires php   5 3 but 7 1 7 is installed 
yeah  i know  but is not my query  is doctrine query  i think can be something in the database 
never used them so don't know how they work  probably stay as they are now  
hello  ocramius   thank you for taking some time to review all of this  in the appprodprojectcontainer php at line 3072 there is this method   about apcu  for now we are trying to reduce its usage by removing the result cache from it  it seems the servers are becoming more stable  i opened an issue because i wanted to find the root cause to make sure we won't run into it again in the future 
i'm not sure if i follow you  the entities  card    account  and such do not inherit from  product   we didn't design it that way because we usually work with mixed collections  lists of products usually containe cards  accounts  loans    what you are suggesting is making those entitis inherit from  product  
how do i get it  
 ocramius for example  i want to get all plants with assoc concrete_id is x  i know  i can create a query builder  but in my case i want that will be is dynamic 
i updated the description  hopefully it is more clear now  is it enough or would you like to have a runnable test app or some other kind of test script 
that's what i thought since it is an aggregate function  it feels surprising that such functions are not considered to be valid tokens in this context 
it is more a "dislike" than a problem  we could argue redundancy  but since it is 3 chars long i wont  😄 currency is always the same for the 10 amounts  the way to store this normally is 1 currency field  and 10 amounts  embeddables should not do that  obviously   custom types should be able to  but they cannot due to the lack of context in the 2 methods mentioned above 
indeed a philosophical question if a many to many update is an update  however  for the lazy mode  it is considered as an update  so i think it should either also be one for extra_lazy  or no update for both modes  i don't know how to listen for the postupdate event in these test cases   
as i pointed out  in my fuctional test case  memory does explode  too  however there it does not make a difference if i use  getresult  or  getsinglescalarresult   in my production code  i am only exchanging  getsinglescalarresult  with  getresult  in the repository code  in first case  1g of memory is exhausted after 1700 iterations  with  getresult   all 17000 iterations run with peak mem usage of 480 mb 
hello  ocramius  thank you for your quick response  you are right it seems to be a bug  i'm blocked by match   in orm query parser php  i'm using the string_functions regexp  doctrineextensions query mysql regexp
thank you for your keyword  i solved it by setting the fetch options of both side to eager  
 senseexception i've added the stacktrace and error message 
it works in master  thanks  ocramius    any idea on the progress of v3 and would it be released in the next year 
i'm not sure i understand  in my tests  changing the  lastdownloadedby  field in  uploadedfile  to  not  nullable will indeed change the commit order  avoiding the problem  unfortunately  not really  i'm lacking a deeper understanding of the commit order calculation process  to be precise  i don't understand why  unitofwork#getcommitorder    adds nullable associations as dependencies in the  commitordercalculator   are nullable associations relevant for the commit order  if you try to  insert  an entity that contains a nullable reference to another  not yet inserted entity  the reference can just be set to  null  during the insertion  and then later updated once the referenced entity is inserted   in fact  that's precisely what's happening with the  lastuploadedfile  field if this issue is worked around   so my first thought would be to only add non nullable associations as dependencies in the  commitordercalculator   but this approach causes a considerable number of tests to fail  so i did not pursue it further  and at this point i'm out of ideas  would be nice if someone who knows more about the commit order calculation than me could chime in 
if i invert the mapping it's working  but both cases should be covered in my opinion  we can't always do the queries from the owning side  i solved the problem by creating a custom repository method for the uniqueentity validator where i fetch only the user entity without any join  but maybe slc could ignore entities that are not yet persisted or have the identifier   null

hi  i don't mean coupling the jsb to cctexturecache in any way  however  when the application receives a memory warning   applicationdidreceivememorywarning  in ios  we're already freeing up some resources  such as in the texture cache  since the application has a responsibility to free up resources at this point  one thing that could potentially be cleared up is the garbage objects from jsb  i know that gc happens on demand handled by the runtime itself  and also that the developer can perform this themselves as you mentioned  however right now there is no way to handle the application memory warning event in the js runtime  and it seems to me that it could be the engine's responsibility to ensure that enough resources are freed so that the application is less likely to get purged by the os when memory is low  furthermore  i believe that the jsb exists in cocos2dx to make it easier more convenient for developers to create games  javascript itself lets you not worry about memory management  well  kind of     so perhaps we should not rely on developers to consider performing gc themselves when the application already knows that their is a low memory warning 
the expected behavior should be the green line  which is times  the system font  the other two fonts are imported fonts

cocos2d x 3 6
 andyque sorry  it's my mistake  alert  setstring "text label   ttf test"   alert1  setstring "text label   ttf test"  
no  i get it from utf8 file and it work's fine with api createwithttf
code  auto node   node  create    node  setcascadeopacityenabled true   node  setcascadecolorenabled true   addchild node   auto progresstimer   progresstimer  create sprite   node  addchild progresstimer   node  setcolor color3b  red   version  v3 4 platform  all reason  as we know  cascade functions are based on parent child connection  however  the internal sprite is not a child of progresstimer 
to reproduce the problem create a brand new c++ project   1      edit helloworldscene h to inherit scene and have member vector   note that this code works fine in v3 6 or older 
hi  super626 could you please explain "coordinates"  the artist doesn't understand what "coordinates" is  he uses 3dsmax for modeling  will "reset xform" work on this issue 
i think it's cocos2d x 3 4beta0  and  yeah  stencil buffer is not enabled  d cocos2d x debug info 1174   create rendererrecreatedlistener for glprogramstate d cocos2d x debug info 1174   stencil buffer is not enabled  d cocos2d x debug info 1174   create rendererrecreatedlistener for glprogramstate d cocos2d x debug info 1174   create rendererrecreatedlistener for glprogramstate i think this log is from clippingnode  init node  stencil  because my code called clippingnode  create node  stencil    still  i don't know why stencil buffer is not enabled on android while it is on ios 
i modified the picture and the  fnt file to include the missing character  also  note that the issue is not the character is missing but the whole label does not show 
 stevetranby   we tested it some years ago  please refer to https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1xolpgyfowsza2rxnvrcavs7ilagiv049o5mpl29cwls edit#gid 6 cocos2d  map k  v  is using  std  unordered_map  while  cocos2d  dictionary  is using ut_hash  test code could be found at  performance test  project 
if i want to render something once and use result later   in both cases sprite shouldn't be visible  but it is 
 pandamicro there are nothing special  just  this x +  1   
sorry  i was busy with something different  i've made you small demo  here is an  apk to run on your android devices  https   mega nz # os5bstor uspk1emhlpbihakmar33yc7yebcwo lmp4bckgipisu and here is the project  you have throw in cocos2d yourself  i used 3 8   https   mega nz # lwiystty ibsalmeaspmfjyxjzncttjpl_skcqh5i_itpsaqe5u4 here you will see the very same app running on a samsung galaxy s4 with android 5 0 1 and a nexus 5 with android 6 0    img_1423  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 396475 10883457 6007f3d8 8172 11e5 8fe4 f875f2fe8e59 jpg  the font rendering on samsung devices is pretty much broken  you could also say  nonexistent  the demo i build you doesn't crash  look into  helloworldscene cpp   line 37 downwards to create the scenario where it'll crash 
hey  not at a computer right now  but can you try it without autorelease  i remember doing it like this 
vs 2013
call setstencil   twice with different nodes after clippingnode has been added to a running scene

 dumganhar yes  you are right  i just tested it on a samsung s6 with android 5 x and it worked  but it won't work on the nexus 6p with android 7 1 1  using cocos2dx v3 12 works fine though on android 7 1 1  so what exactly has changed between cocos2dx 3 12 and 3 13 1 3 14 
we should use it  but the current targetsdk isn't an integer  so it can't included into the v3 branch until the android p sdk is final 
 dumganhar   i don't know  it is the first time i use  extensions  controlswitch  class   minggo   here there is a simple test project  ios tested    controlswitchtest zip  https   github com cocos2d cocos2d x files 373067 controlswitchtest zip  anyway i think that  controlswitch  create  is not consistent with cocos2d x style  it should be something like that  controlswitch   create const string  masksprite  const string  onsprite  const string  offsprite  const string  thumbsprite  parameters of type const string   instead of  sprite

 dumganhar  i use qt creator for detecting crashes  cpp empty test or cpp tests work properly  but i don't know what to do to fix that  on my working mac all works fine  but some times i refactor code on my personal pc with ubuntu  earlier at version 3 11 1 all works perfectly  but after updating dependencies that need 3 14 1 both versions of engine crash on this project  i also run project on virtual box in win7 and it works fine  there are two things that i don't standard do in project to reduce draw calls  i use cocosstudio for ui and replace all of ui  text with cocos2d  label with bmfont from same atlas that ui located  the second thing that i using my own renderer for spine animation that use native cocos atlas to mix spine skeletons with sprites  please can you help me find where the problem  because when my project crashing 7 times from 10 builds on startup it's very sad for me 
how did you get this log  _i got those log by the plugin report to my backstage _  i didn't change those files   dumganhar

so  i had tested it on my current version of cocos2d x  i can make a pr if necessary  but only if it will take small time for me  real working code is  file       cocos platform android libcocos2dx build gradle  
the folder_path example above in my code is constructed like this  getwritablepath   + "newfolder "  so i only work within the writable path

 setforce2dqueue true   is used so the ship and the rendertextures are on the same render queue  if they are not on the same render queue  the rendertexture can't visit the ship  the resulting render is entirely blank  an alternative way to put them on the same render queue is to use  setglobalzorder 1   ship3d  setglobalzorder 1   rendertexdefault  setglobalzorder 1   rendertexwithbuffer  setglobalzorder 1   however  using  setglobalzorder 1   has the same broken results as  setforce2dqueue true  
nope  i use only  at first time and error occurred  i used audioengine test this error 
i tried from a brand new 3 14 project and with the code above 
thanks for the reply  minggo  take for example unity's gameobject transform component  when you translate it's parent transform  the relative position of the child keeps the same  but the global position changes by the same amount  this works just like de node position in cocos2dx  however  for the globalzorder property it's not the case  where the child value remains unchanged  to sum up  i think it would be great that globalzorder behaved like a z axis  even if it's not 3d  so if you have a parent with globalzorder of 10  and a child with 5  when you change the parent to 13  the child would change to 8  on the other hand  if you change the child to 7  the parent remains unchanged  10

it's consistent with older devices  ipad mini and ipad 3 so far  newer devices  ipadair2  does not experience this issue  doesn't occur on win32 or android as far as we have tested 
it is generally comply with https   community kde org policies binary_compatibility_issues_with_c++  adding new functions is ok  green color in the report   adding new virtual functions may not be ok in several cases  red color   thank you 
ubuntu 16 04，soft link information is lost on mac too  but it only have a bad effect on linux build  for fmod libs is only used on linux platform  so that our developers have to make a soft link manually on linux  when build and run using cocos2d x __zip__ package

hi  guys i config trun server for bigbluebutton and after that  i got the good performance and my users didn't get 1020 or 2200 error  after install and config turn server i can connect 30 video in a meeting without error too 
hi basisbit  thank you for the reply  https   easyupload io 4vohik here is the video including the comparison with paint 
i'm trying to join a server set up with the bbb install script  so i assume directly       error is 1002  i've digged around on the server a little bit and found out  that apparently after the upgrade some integration with the freeswitch service is broken 
yep it worked    thanks   
problem is implementation jwt server side on tarantool  while making signature of header and payload you will get incorrect signature   jwt io  https   jwt io #debugger  has debugger to check your signature and data in requests  for example  if you have more than one backends and pass through token to python backend which has generated by tarantool  token will invalid in process of validation

strange   i don't see it in the sources  i honestly hope you're not talking about one liners from json test lua etc  
as i can see it's the 'i' modifier for the function pointer which causes the problem  but i don't know enough inline assembly to fix it right away

it would be good if update upsert operations supports min max function  or maybe binary module with custom operations  like    box space tester upsert  12 'c'     'min'  3  1000    'max'  4  2000      with such appoach many task may be realized in fastest way 
i observe this behavior in pandoc 1 12 4 2  mac version downloaded and installed   but see that it is not present in pandoc 1 12 2 1  compiled from haskell sources  
i don't think that can be the issue  'left arrow' or whatever is not an obscure or unusual character  which is why it works fine for pandoc all these years pre emojification   and it doesn't turn into an empty box when we use the selector 15  it remains exactly what it should be  a little unicode arrow   i already provide a good webfont  adobe source serif pro   ios just overrides it anyway  and the override must be overridden  maybe  but there would still remain the question of setting the default arrow to avoid this even if the backarrows were customizable  since users should not be expected to know to prevent as arcane and dumb a behavior as this   and since that is unlikely to be implemented any time soon while this is a very simple easy fix  literally add 1 character + comments   let's not let the perfect be the enemy of better 
currently  i know nearly nothing about the implementation side in pandoc and why it represents two different syntactic and symantic elements as the same ast element  is this intentional or just caused by code evolution  from the users point of view i guess that having a compact list inside a table is much less frequent than having simple tables and compact lists outside of tables  hence the benefit of a "plain table style" would outweight the rare cases of compact lists inside tables  but indeed  an inconsistency would be introduced at the same time

thanks for the reply   wolfv it looks like gfm does not support  a+b c  and   a+b c   very well  i tried locally using gollum and also the web based wiki editor  neither of them are working  did i miss anything here   jgm i think leave the gfm as an option would be a good idea  so we can be instructed to avoid "non gfm" format 
fine  i've done that  here  https   sourceforge net p bibutils discussion general thread ec44f10c    i wasn't sure whether you maintained your own version of bibutils or not  the direct convertor sounds good   thanks for your work on pandoc  btw   i'm using it with nvalt and marked for my daily academic notes  and it is invaluable  i don't know of another way of handling bibliographic info well using markdown  without going via latex 
thanks  mb21  that's exactly it  the https proxy needs to be reachable via http  so   export https_proxy http   user password 192 168 81 81 3142 solved it  to  jgm  yes  my  slides mdwn  contains links to external images with https urls
thanks for the information  i'm ok in closing this  if you are  please do it 
 ivotron  if i understand correctly  you mean instead of using    include before body  and    include after body   i should put the contents of these files in the yaml metadata block  on every page i process using pandoc  i could do that  but the resulting duplication wouldn't be a good practice  if we are supposed to do that  then why even have these command line options  the reason i'm using pandoc as opposed to another markdown processor is because it provides a rudimentary macro expansion facility  i don't need anything else than basic templating  and pandoc delivers  however  i think the facility could be improved to make other existing facilities more functional 
 mszep  that's what i usually do  but it takes more time to match the exact settings when using longer  komplex command line options with pdf conversion  it would be faster to immediately have pandoc telling me the location of the intermediate files by adding a simple additional flag to the command   
sorry  i was in a hurry when i posted this  i should've provided a sample  so for example i want a heading and then a list of one line items  something like  notice they're left aligned  
thanks very much 
here is the docs  https   github com textile php textile blob master src netcarver textile parser php  line 82 86  http   txstyle org doc 10 definition lists this pattern allows the ability of proper dl  rather than the naïve implementation of redcloth  you should consider it 
to both  the ncx is an epub 2 document  but can be included in epub 3 for backwards compatibility  when it is included  therefore  it still follows the epub 2 spec  which is where it is stated that playorder is not required provided the ncx document does not have a doctype 
thanks for your positive comment  i personally have not tried the conversion chain as you mentioned  the current choices are bulky with regards to its dependencies  while not being and not aspiring to be universal markup translators  like pandoc  going through intermediate formats instead of one pandoc invocation seems hacky to me  recently  i read about two publishing houses switching away from latex and moving to asciidoc as their source format  so i gather that it fulfills the needs of technical writing well  also regarding referencing and i find it useful to have another capable plain text format for documents  if software support is good and can easily convert between different formats and offers multiple output choices  which is where this feature would come in     i personally would also like to write articles and possibly a book rather in asciidoc than latex  which is   at least my personal   motivation for this feature 
as html output i would suggest something lime this  http   drz ac 2013 01 17 latex theorem like environments for the web  i thought that pandoc doesn't support latex environments  so that would probably be something that is necessary to implement amsthm 
oh  thanks and sorry  i was not aware of this option  yaml metadata are keeped using it  now there is a "true" in the top of the final document between yaml metadatas and the beginning of the content of the document  like this     yaml content     true title document              but this is another issue  i'll do some search about that  this one is solved thank you
it works using  pdflatex  in the shell  although i don't know what pandoc uses

sorry  you're right  i had  1 12 2  on that machine 
indeed it works better with pandoc's last release  thank's you   yet i get some display troubles with the following sample   this document displays chinese characters with a special package  in the  epub version it seems like the tabular is not used to build the page 
i tried to build pandoc with cabal with no success  fedora 30 has cabal 2 2 0 0 and ghc 8 4 4  so requirements described in " installing pandoc  https   github com jgm pandoc blob master install md " are met  however  the build process fails    cabal update downloading the latest package list from hackage haskell org   cabal install pandoc resolving dependencies        downloading cabal 2 4 1 0    configuring cabal 2 4 1 0    building cabal 2 4 1 0    installed cabal 2 4 1 0 downloading pandoc 1 9 4 3    configuring pandoc 1 9 4 3    failed to install pandoc 1 9 4 3 build log    home vdb  cabal logs ghc 8 4 4 pandoc 1 9 4 3 gkce6lvbu1k55vthf6gvpd log    cabal  entering directory ' tmp cabal tmp 21907 pandoc 1 9 4 3' cabal  leaving directory ' tmp cabal tmp 21907 pandoc 1 9 4 3' cabal  error  some packages failed to install  pandoc 1 9 4 3 gkce6lvbu1k55vthf6gvpd failed during the configure step  the exception was  dieverbatim  user error  cabal  ' usr bin ghc' exited with an error   tmp cabal tmp 21907 pandoc 1 9 4 3 dist setup setup hs 10 33  error  module ‘distribution simple ghc’ does not export ‘ghcpackagedboptions’   10   import distribution simple ghc  ghcpackagedboptions                         tmp cabal tmp 21907 pandoc 1 9 4 3 dist setup setup hs 19 1  error  could not find module ‘system time’ perhaps you meant system cputime  from base 4 11 1 0  system cmd  from process 1 6 5 1  system mem  from base 4 11 1 0  use  v to see a list of the files searched for    19   import system time                       tmp cabal tmp 21907 pandoc 1 9 4 3 dist setup setup hs 24 1  error  could not find module ‘data default’ use  v to see a list of the files searched for    24   import data default                         it is not clear why cabal downloaded pandoc 1 9 4 3  the latest release published on github is 2 7 3  
it won't work for parameters spanning over multiple lines    echo  e " mylatexcmd a  n b  c "   pandoc  t latex  mylatexcmd a   b  c  my example at first is not precise    sorry  do you think keeping parsing the text over multiple lines is reasonable  thanks  on wed  dec 16  2015 at 5 30 pm  john macfarlane notifications github com wrote 
metadata  see the manual under "metadata" for how to do this   so pandoc is warning you that it's using the title "hello"  derived from the filename  in order to have a valid title element  this will show up in the title bar of browsers when they look at this web page  i see  can this be done without a warning  if i get the default title which pandoc chooses then i am 99  happy  in 1   when i want a custom title  it's my duty to read the docs and set it  there more than one  including subtle depending on environments and hosts  for example  in the console host run this  i e  in powershell console

it's based on an existing word template i've had knocking around since forever  i wasn't aware of that recommendation    maybe it should be part of the    data dir  docs 
not sure about the technical details  but a canvas is an invisible rectangular container that you can add graphics and text to  so that they move around a a group 
github makes the anchor  # c cmd   so i would expect   toc  t markdown_github to generate a toc usable on github  i'm using doctoc for this at the moment  which makes the right toc links 
the only difference is the   bibtex  extension  right  i tried that too  but got the same error  just tried the exact same command on my mac  and there it does work without any errors 
the actual epub contains private information  but i could remove personal stuff from it  instead i tried to install the latest version from git  so that i could test it locally  have been trying to install for the past day  without success  perhaps because this is the first time i am doing anything with haskell  looks like i am getting closer to an install  if not  i will send a minimal working bug  for you to try  arif on tue  may 17  2016 at 9 39 pm john macfarlane notifications github com wrote 
nevermind   docx  and  odt  are viable parse from   parse to formats  i needed to pass the   f  and   t  flags to have it properly function  just fyi  my output from  pandoc  v  is   my version was taken directly from the ubuntu 16 04 dep cache 
 ickc that's really neat  thanks for all the information   
thanks for both your comments and suggestions  i checked pmd version and it was 1 16 which i have now moved to 1 18  i can now report that the glyphs _are_ being produced  yay  re +jgm's suggestions    ibooks _does_ handle upub3 but some of the math is not beautiful  for example     bar x    is reproduced with the bar a long distance above x  so long that you might miss it if you weren't looking for it    use mathjax node  i have now installed mathjax node and await progress on the integration with pandoc  since my goal is epub   thanks 
ok  thanks for your responses and for the tip  this is not a big problem  just a remark  in a powershell console   chcp 65001  is not enough  it must be replaced by
 jgm  in  1   there are no spaces after the   code   node  just a newline  a newline character should  not  be treated as a space even if it is preceding actual content  in regard to case  2   yes    pre   preserves white spaces  but then pandoc should be accepting the   code   node as a literal otherwise it should be taking the contents of   code   and taking it as reformatted which would  not  include the whitespace of pretty printed html because the content is within the   code   node and not   pre   node  i used to make a living off of living  breathing  and sleeping xml so i see a problem with case  1  and case  2   in terms of html  that's a different story altogether     as far as recommendations from my perspective    two_cents     a preceding newline should not be treated as a space nor should any newline character    pretty printed code should not impact a   pre   node if there are children nodes  children nodes should be treated as preformatted and not impacted by the pretty printed structure     two_cents     
in redcloth  http   redcloth org try redcloth   the following markup  with the first 2 lines being a code block  inside pre   note that   inside   the code block i'm using    pre    and not    pre   i don't know how to markup the 2nd one    inside   a code block 
ah  yes it does have something to do with pandoc the library  at least i think it does   i had assumed that  commitbuffer  was an internal pandoc function  it's hard for me to pinpoint which part of the program is calling  commitbuffer  but my intuition is it's some pure code within pandoc  i run pandoc a number of times here to render a  pandoc  into variables to use in a template  https   github com schell milkshake blob d030301353b37cd1ee513dfdb2a29ce2c9edb301 src milkshake compile hs#l152 l186 you can see the callsite and what happens with those vars  i'm calling  rendertemplate'  with them  here  https   github com schell milkshake blob d030301353b37cd1ee513dfdb2a29ce2c9edb301 src milkshake compile hs#l289 l300 i think the error happens somewhere in  rendertemplate'  but i'm not sure  actually now that i think of it maybe it's happening in  writefile   i'll do a test with my cicd server and get back to you  also   thanks for this wonderful library

sure  i wasn't aware there was a different one for pandoc citeproc  sorry  since i didn't find a way to move this issue there directly  i created a new issue in jgm pandoc citeproc and copy pasted the content  this is it  https   github com jgm pandoc citeproc issues 289 i also don't seem to be able to close this one  apologies  i'm not really experienced in using github

the presence of "body copy" in the list is a coincidence following the docx file where i first came across a content control  i e   w sdt    the docx file was being used to describe a web form  so there is no meaningful equivalence between the  w dropdownlist  and one of the possible _values_ being "body copy"  or "dropdown list" for that matter  in retrospect i should have provided an example where the list items had nothing to do with software things  as far as i know  the best output when a  w sdt  is found would be to replace it with the contents of the  w sdtcontents  tag contained within the  w sdt   i'm guessing the  w sdtpr   structured document tag properties  should just be discarded  there may be other kinds of word content controls that should be handled differently  i don't know  i know as little about word as possible  i'll take a look at the office file format spec  open xml  ecma 376  and report if i see anything useful and survive the ordeal  later    i looked at the wordml spec  https   www ecma international org publications standards ecma 376 htm   structured document tags are described in part 1  section 17 5 2  pp 499   546  the gist  p 500   within a structured document tag  there are two child elements which contain the definition and the content of this sdt  the first of these is the sdtpr element  which contains the set of properties specified for this structured document tag  the second is the sdtcontent element  which contains all the content which is contained within this structured document tag  table cells are described in 17 5 2 17  and are just one of many places where  w sdt  may be found  tl dr  this element specifies the presence of a structured document tag around a single table cell  the two child elements of this element shall be used to specify the properties and content of the current structured document tag via the sdtpr and sdtcontent elements  respectively 
yes  i would check the manual first before posting  i checked and found it outdated and downloaded the latest just to double check   mb21 has a good enough suggestion i believe

thanks for comments which seems to have solved the problem  in fact big pandoc md files are not a problem  even a many thousand pages file was rendered properly   but when a tex header file and latex commands were included the system crashed  i have no idea how to limit memory of pandoc's haskell  and even if i limited how should this solve the problem  but your comments guided me to https   github com jgm pandoc issues 3169  i added "  trace" and everything seems to be ok  have to run additional tests    perhaps someone can explain why tracing every step on stdout may remedy the problem  
this seems to work  other metadata fields are still not there  though   although they appear in the template  see  here  https   groups google com forum # topic pandoc discuss 4gfat ehwty   but i guess i should open a new issue for this if this turns out to be a bug  right 
it's a stretch to consider that someone would want empty input for some main sequence of workflow  perhaps someone might try to test the effect is something else were failing for unknown causes  the main reason i would favor the base case not being treated as a special case is that in a scripted or otherwise automated environment the result is more likely to match the assumptions of the calling mechanism if the empty set is handled simply as the trivial case  i place reduced emphasis on such a strong parallel to the cli handling  files omitted on the command line meaning that standard input is read is a familiar metaphor mostly these reasons relate to what is natural for someone to write when working in the interactive command prompt  not about the way one thinks of the data structure that would be constructed internal to application as a result  the strict interpretation of the cli metapor translates poorly to the yaml data block  however  it is a good idea that an explicit value can be given that has the same affect as the field being omitted  i suppose one option would be that boolean false represents standard input  though there are good reasons to dislike this idea  i think my single largest problem with the current behavior is that if i needed to put some value that i thought might make standard input get read  then an empty list would be the last thing that would occur to me  also  would there be a way to concatenate standard input with real files  by the way  the reason i originally used this form was to create a minimal test case for the  to   writer  validation problem that i had posted on an earlier topic before it was closed  i suppose that use is plainly not "real word"  but it's still real 
 jgm i tested it and it looks ok
the following prints  tango  when run through pdflatex  not with pandoc 
is there special requirement to my input markdown document  according to philosophy of pandoc  every valid inputs are supposed to be generated to a no error output 
i am also using pandoc 2 7 3
yes  i should have been clearer  markdown to latex  the main benefit of using threeparttable is the ability to use tablenotes  input   the output probably contains errors  because i used the output of pandoc and changed it to what is should look like with threeparttable  but you'll get the gist 
 1a ordered list docx  https   github com jgm pandoc files 3720815 1a ordered list docx  here is the file
 jgm got it  forgive me i misunderstand the document  after i change the   styles    the output successfully changed correspondingly  thanks very much 
 jgm i use a gemini pda which has 1gb ram  plus ghc for arm requires llvm which is pretty time consuming  in the case of the  emoji  module  one can also set conditional flags in the   cabal  file so that it is not compiled exposed when a given flag is set 
i think a static variable in a config file will be the best solution  a list of allowed domains incase anyone wants to use multiple domains  if you would allow multiple domains and someone connects on ip directly  there should be either a default domain name or the domain name should be selectable on registration 
yeah  looks like my pod got updated  everything works now  d
oh yes missing migration     now it's working 
searching for tags with suggestions  similar like how we do searches for people 
live http headers and the development log entry  http   pastebin com uhw5kcue it might have something to do with the fact that i haven't been able to send messages to other accounts  i still have to dig into that one

sorry  i don't know what you mean by "appserver"  i'm running on a ubuntu 10 04 server  installed with the ubuntu install script  more or less   had to do some stuff manually  but basically the process outlined in that script is what i used   edit  a ha  i wasn't starting the websocket  that wasn't mentioned in the ubuntu script and i neglected to read the readme    stupid  sorry for the confusion 
  that's nice        but how did you find that  o o

i usually have my stream sorted by date  when i'm on the home page i can see some posts appearing like it should be  but when i reload the page  i get some posts  which were postet before the ones  which were streamed live  after that posts are in the right time order 
here you are  https   joindiaspora com posts 1133936
it now shows up on mine  too  whatever i'll close this

 grzuy sorry for the delayed reply  this issue doesn't happen now it was happening before few days after its working fine  so i'm closing this issue
i'm using postgresql 9 1 2
it looks fixed to me  should anything be done for the use case of a person entering _lots_ of blank lines  markdown default is to ignore them and make a paragraph  some folks want to see the extra blank lines  personally  i prefer happy little paragraphs and dislike the extra lines 
i need to confer with the user who wrote me about this  i'll write you the steps as far as possible
not atm  sorry
sorry  i totally forgot that  ## image 1  3 rows of text   loading     http   s14 directupload net images 120118 dr9xsyv4 png  ## image 2  6 rows of text   loading     http   s7 directupload net images 120118 7g3yxgeo png  so  as you can see  the textbox is always about three rows bigger than it needs to be  i think that doesn't look so nice    besides  the textbox gets slightly smaller in height when typing in the first character

ok weirdly  although it looks more like a server thing  i just tried in firefox and it worked  fails in chromium on ubuntu though 
it could be a multi step setting  public to the world  google etc  public to all connected pods  for people who don't want their stuff in commercial search engines  public to this pod  useful for special  regional communities and company networks  public to all you aspects  already exists  public to specific aspects  already exists 
this problem has persisted for a few days with all browsers during the christmas holidays  then it was fixed  i'm sorry  i should close this issue 
i'm using windows vista  i just tried it on another computer running windows 7  and i'm having the same issue there 
i don't understand what a pod is but the browser is firefox 8 0 1 stable  hmm  it might be because of firefox  i found some problems with css representation maybe css is not the only problem of firefox i mean  on diaspora and youtube compared to google chrome 
i did a little test myself  https   pod elephly net posts 41556 it works with firefox and doesn't with chrome    with chrome there is an extra bullet point at the end

g'day dave  yes  thought i've been digging around abit the last hour and think it maybe something to do with nodejs not included in debian  by way of aptitude   my debian install is fresh  as of 4 hours ago  and i've followed the instructions to the dot  i'm trying a nodejs method now then will try again and report my findings    
my pod gets automatically updated on daily basis by essentially issuing the following commands   edit  just removed  bundle and fired the update script   
it defaults to  false  when you clone the repo  already 
hey  well  first  this is super weird  it told me my  rvmrc  had changed and i was missing some gems so i had to run  bundle install  again  i swear it was all right last time i updated diaspora     oh well  then  i can find my user ok in the db  but the query on the notifications yields an empty array  no errors  and actually  just going  u person notifications  also returns an empty array  so i don't know why the front end shows me an unread badge with a count of 1    
ah  thank you  my search didn't catch that pr  my understanding is that to be able to  mention someone  you don't need mutual sharing  but you need to be sharing with that person  i e  they need to be in your aspects   if they are sharing with me but they're not in my aspects  i can't  mention them  this is certainly how it's always worked for me  and is still the case in 0 5 10  i've just double checked   at the moment  it can work with a one way sharing relationship in either direction  i don't have a problem with the scope being increased in this way  which is why i wondered whether it was intended or not  if anything  it makes more sense to be able to  mention someone who is sharing with you  as they have indicated that they want contact with you  with the old behaviour   you can  mention anyone you have added to your aspects  regardless whether they are sharing with you   there is more risk of unwanted messages  so i don't see any privacy spam issue with the scope being increased like this  keeping the old behaviour but adding the ability to mention people who share with me  if everyone's happy with this change  let's keep it this way   i'll just update the tutorials to include this  
thanks mrzyx  i'll do it

hi goob  same issue in arabic so it may be an rtl issue indeed  i just noticed something else  when i click on the area left of the button  as long as it is above the separation line and not further left  the file selection window actually shows up  see picture  it is the the same in hebrew and arabic    profp  https   f cloud github com assets 6691493 2178595 89215a52 966e 11e3 99a3 ffe3dba190ac png  i updated the issue description here and in other issues to include arabic too  i also tried other ltr languages and there was no problem

okay    add a user e g  mine  quix0r pod mxchange org to 2 or more aspects   then try to remove the account from one by clicking on the check symbol next to it   a red message appears that it fails to remove   setting a user agent for my pod doesn't fix this  in firebug it says   delete https   pod mxchange org aspect_memberships 326 403 forbidden 160ms  so maybe i need to allow that type of http request  or can you rewrite it

hi folks  using the specified admin account seems like the way to  ignoring the welcome_sendmsg flag if no account is specified  too  i'll compose an intriguing        welcome message up until saturday  maybe we could shortly agree on the contents  i'd like to mention at least the following things    "hi  welcome to this pod"   some links to sites containing information on how to use diaspora  any ideas     link to legal terms   some information on whom to contact in case the pod doesn't behave as expected   some encouragement to support your podmin  "say thank you"  bitcoin  paypal  if something else comes to your mind  just mention it    cheers so far  thomas
well  i believe all options in http   unicorn bogomips org unicorn configurator html should be configurable  personally i change the pid and socket lines  then one would like to change the  backlog  number  the user group which the worker could run  etc  also  the  working directory  http   unicorn bogomips org unicorn configurator html#method i working_directory  is useful 
it is for smartphones only  it is very hard to use on a normal phone  try using diaspora with the linked emulator to see what i mean

good point  yeah  was shared to all aspects  tried all kind of combinations now  all aspects  public    visible in every aspect + stream just for particular  fun     visible in fun + stream i was just really suprised that  if i post multiple posts in a short time  the aspects with low activity did contain mostly just my posts on top  the point is  for me personally it doesn't make sense to show posts from myself in the "aspects" view  currently diaspora is designed to do so  but can this maybe be discussed 
 thefox41 do you mean settings js   jhass i have just had a look  the only 'error' in the log is failing human verification which is obviously failing to answer it correctly  on the other hand here is the last few lines on the log 
  the buttons seem to keep their last state  so i can easily keep sharing if i do not want to  or stop sharing even if all i wanted is not share a single posting   i can share to other media by topic  i e   if i connect to a specific tumblr account for my photography  i can continue using diaspora and whenever i post something tagged #photography that ends up in the right place without me having to toggle buttons  on wed  feb 8  2017 at 11 47 pm  goob  notifications github com  wrote 
thanks for your response  i can definitely consistently recreate this bug and write down the steps  i'll try to do this soon  in the meantime i have discovered why sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn't    the autocreated #dandelion hashtag which the dandelion app auto inserts at the bottom of each message uses a strange small letter i in dandelion  when i manually type #dandelion i don't get this strange i and that's when the post disappears  it's almost like the dandelion app makers are aware of this diaspora bug and are working around it  here is a copy paste of the hashtag they use  look closely at the i  #dandelíon
i've just tried rotation with the latest "v0 9 9 wip1"  but it doesn't seem to work properly  screen width and height should be inverted if rotation is 90° or 270°   
i've recompiled it and the issue still exist  window not responsive   the only thing that changed was instead of displaying  0 0 it displays 0 0 in rgui  retroarch cfg value  fastforward_ratio   "0 000003" i don't remember if it was the same in the last build  and i'm not too knowledgeable to revert commits 
it's fixed in nightly feb 18 
this should be ok now

and and single refresh cycle beam racing mis sync artifacts are not really objectionable  an instantaneous one refresh cycle reappearance of a tearline that disappears when the beam racing "catches up" and goes back to the jitter margin tolerances   240p scaled onto 1080p is roughly 4 5 real scanlines per 1 emulator scanline  obviously  the real raster "register" will increment scan line number roughly 4 5 times faster  but as you have seen  tearline jedi successfully beam races a radeon geforce on both pc mac   without a raster register   simply by using existing precision counter offsets  sure  there's 1 scanline jittering as seen in youtube video    but tearing never shows in emulators because that's 100  fully hidden in the jittermargin technique making it 100  artifactless even if it is 1ms ahead or 1ms behind    if you've configured those beam racing tolerances for example    can be made an adjustable slider    tighter for super fast more realtime systems    a looser for slower older systems   but we're only worried about screen height distance between the two  we need to merely simply make sure the emuraster is at least 1 frameslice  or more  below the realraster  relative screen height wise    and we can continue adding vsync off frameslices in between emu raster and real raster    creating a tearingless vsync off mode  because the framebuffer swap  present   or glutswapbuffers    is a duplicate screen area  no pixels changed  so no tearline is visible  it's conceptually easy to understand once you have the "eureka" moment    lagless vsync jitter margin  https   www blurbusters com wp content uploads 2018 03 beamchasingjittermargin 690x129 png    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 1774867 42728698 8d0f7ed0 878e 11e8 9a6f 02f0539be90f png  there's already high speed video proof of sub frame latencies  same frame response  achieved with this technique  e g  mid screen input reads for bottom of screen reactions are possible  replicating original's machine latency  to an error margin of one frameslice   as you can see  the  intentionally visible  rasters in the earlier videos are so stable and falls within common jittermargin sizes  for intentionally invisible tearlines   with this  you create a  16 7ms   1 67ms   15ms jitter margin   that means with 10 frameslices with the refresh cycle wraparound jitter margin technique    your beamracing can go too fast or too slow in a much wider and much safer 15ms range  today  windows scheduling is sub 1ms and pi schecduling is sub 4ms  so it's not a problem  the necessary accuracy to do realworld beamracing happened 8 to 10 years ago already  yes  nobody really did it for emulators because it took someone to apply all the techniques together  1  understanding how to beamrace a gpu   2  initially understanding the low level black box of present   to photons at least to the video output port signal level   3  understanding the techniques to make it very forgiving  and  4  experience with 8 bit era raster interrupts  in tests  winuae beam racing actually worked on a year 2010 desktop with an older gpu  at lower frameslice granularities    someone also posted screenshots of an older intel 4000 series gpu laptop in the winuae beamracing thread  zero artifacts  looked perfectly like vsync on but virtually lagless  well    one frameslice's worth of lag   your question is understandable  but the fantastic new knowledge we all now have  now compensates totally for it    a desktop with a geforce gtx titan about  100x the accuracy margin needed for sub refresh latency frameslice beam racing  so as a reminder  the accuracy requirements necessary to pull off this technical feat  already occured 8 to 10 years ago and the winuae emulator successfully is beamracing on an 8 year old computer today in tests  i implore you to reread our research  especially the 18 point best practices   watch the videos  and view the links  to understand that it is actually quite forgiving thanks to the jittermargin technique    bet you are surprised to learn that we are already so far past the rubicon necessary for this reliable accuracy  as long as the best practices are followed

yes it did and again thank you very much  i had made a post but quickly deleted it  stupid on my end and i realized as soon as i hit the comment button  i've got a busy day ahead but i will start making public android compiles asap 
overlay does not depend of touch support 
ok  i'll try that  the reason i wanted to change the port its because when i try to host a game the app freezes completely and i have to do a force quit  my guess is that because my default port is not open  and it's not   that's the reason the app crashes  that's why i was changing the port for one i already got opened and stumbled upon that key duplicating issue  hope it works  thank you   
i will try that  are there plans to fix that  i assume this is an issue for all touch based devices  android  ios  etc   thanks 
i never changed anything in the retroarch config file  i didn't understand why and how this value could change 
it totally does it's under input  input hotkeys bind  game focus toggle the default is scroll lock or something awkward to get to on portables so i changed it to num lock  maybe your problem is that you have it to a combination of keys that causes problems being recognized somehow  or because it's not a 'natural' toggle key like the 'x lock' keys  though i don't know why that wouldn't work   what it does is to toggle every single 'hotkey' that is system related off and on while running the core and not on menus  ie  not retropad controller bindings  the disabled keys  don't  include the menu shortcut for the retropad thankfully  even on cores where 'start' and 'select'   the combination i have bound to enter and rightshift   aren't bound to the core like scummvm  
my suspicion is that the division of work of  task_save_handler   that was  probably  related to the widget  to make it display  is slowing down the file i o  i haven't found where that division is done or how to affect the granularity  some help please 
 orbea perfect  thanks  i think for the initial test  1  connect 1 wiimote and your dolphin bar 2  configure wiimote as a retroarch controller via the usual way  please use udev as your input driver 3  load up the libretro test core  it's in https   github com libretro libretro samples tree master tests test but don't seem to be on the buildbot anymore  hmm     4  turn on logging  settings   logging   logging verbosity on  debug panel on  6  press the dpad whilst wiggling the wiimote 7  paste log here i'm hoping it displays mouse  or pointer  data from the wiimote and data from the joypad functions  but anecdotally apparently it only does the latter

yea thats what i'm saying  it's an issue    not just settings i'm looking for  im pretty sure they aint there    or that perhaps it doesn't work right  that would be an issue right 
yes  immediate crash
yes they do   that's why i provided the screens indicating they were present  in the core info it shows the md5 and i also checked for the wiki while getting my bios to make sure they matched on md5 as well 
i am using a 32gb memory card  that has approx 3gb free  i manually downloaded the thumbs for genesis on my pc version of retroarch  and ftp'd them into the thumbnails dir on the vita   they loaded up fine after retroarch launched  but the downloading failed no matter what pack i selected  is there a requirement for a specific amount of free disk  also i looked around but couldnt find any sort of log  is there a way i can enable one from the ui and then provide it or analyze it myself to see whether i can contribute to a fix  i believe i saw someone else having this issue on a subreddit  so its possible im not alone 
this problem happens with git master  i update retroarch almost every day   it happens with all the cores i've tried  bsnes mercury performance  beetle psx hw  gambette  parallel  fba   i downloaded the cores again before trying them  i tried both an x11 session and a wayland session  kde plasma 5  but the crash happens every time i close a game

figured it out  the retroarch uses cache_directory   but it is not in the retroarch cfg so im assuming extraction_dir has been replaced with cache_dir but wasn't replaced in the generated  cfg
i would say 4 days ago top  but i'm not really sure 
here is a screenshot of the sidebar as it is displayed on my system  https   imgur com a ojqqj2x the playlist where the sidebar does not appear   collapse at all is the gameboy one 
"retroarch starts with a dummy core that has a 320x240 frame " if there is no core  it should not show a dar at all  or it should say something like "1 1 par  unknown dar"  "i just started nestopia and it correctly mapped 1 1 par to 8 7 dar " i am using the linux version from a day or so ago  i loaded nestopia core and went back to the setting  it still said 1 1 par is 4 3 dar  integer scale and crop overscan  with a restart  made no difference  also  i tried the vita version  starting up the nestopia core bubble  it still said 1 1 par is 4 3 dar  both of them are version "1 3 6   nestopia 1 48 wip 70f4405" 
okay it works at least as well as it used to when it comes to nes  snes and picodrive also gba now works  very well from what i've seen  pce  mednafen fast   tested on r type  and gambatte recognize roms but they don't award anything and those weird issues with snes recognition persist  sim city  yoshi's island  lost vikings  thanks for great work
ra supports 3d in the menu  the background is displayed about 1 5 cm behind the rest of the options  also  the parallax barriar doesn't change  it turns on and off  the 3d slider adjusts the distance between eyes 
uploaded a vid on how i replicated the bug  did you see that video  i'm not saying that retroarch caused chrome to crash
it happens in both cases  keystrokes in the menu are accepted as well  esc quits  arrow keys move around the menu  and letter keys do whatever they're bound to
my gpu is nvidia geforce gtx 750  i'm not sure how to use the html5 player but i think that might be what i'm mistaking my issue with if youtube uses a html5 player by default now

hi  i tried all the available audio driver  alsa  oss  alsathread and pulse but the audio doesn't work    
i already update my cores every time they are changed  it's just a very manual and meticulous process at current

russian
it works on the standalone mgba 
not sure how to do that orbea    i know that  as mentioned previously  a couple of the games worked fine on version 1 7 8  stable  
solved  thanks   https   github com libretro retroarch issues 2934#issuecomment 396437988
i will try  i am heaving a mess with controls right now  trying to fix that problem since i cant control anything   something in retroarch config is causing a mess
i don't think i can do that because the vita itself is the input  so i can't disconnect it 
keyboard  corsair k63 mouse  logitech mx master 2s controller  steam controller + wireless adapter controller  xbox  xbox one model  + wireless adapter both of the controllers are turned off  turning them on does not seem to make a difference 
well  i don't know in what other way i can use hbl nsp otherwise  as far as i know  booting hekate with the right kips is essentially the same as running atmosphere  and as i said  the problem disappears when using the switch  non threaded  driver 
thread model  posix gcc version 8 3 0  rev1  built by msys2 project  i guess they updated the gcc in msys2 ill try an earlier version  it does make sense i just did an update
gtx 1080 and the nvidia 415 25 driver
tested  it happens on the build from 1 27 and 1 26  but not on 1 25   it was happening on my laptop with a radeon hd 8210  but it also happens on my desktop with a 5770 
i'm running on android and using the latest version of retroarch i seen a bug on previous versions as well
yes
it does  it works in mame if i delete the modeline created by ra and make the same one  with the same name  manually  maybe there's some funky math somewhere  it's very specifically _only_ 384 res  higher is fine  lower is fine  i think   had some problems with vertical games getting squished   i'll open an issue there  thanks   
oh  i´m on 11 3 0 36  luma3ds v9 1  n3ds xl          but that would be the first time that i would have to update the firmware for homebrew
 bparker06 i only noticed it while i was working on the ocr issue  but the code path it is in came from the commit listed in the issue and that code has not been modified since  that commit added that path so the sse2 code for that converter probably has never worked  though the non sse2 path is ok   to reproduce with the raw_screenshot approach  comment out the video_driver_supports_viewport_read   check in the take_screenshot_choice   function of task_screenshot c and take a screenshot on an 8888 core  make sure that sse2 is defined in your build or put some logging in the pixel converter code to make sure it’s getting called and going through that path  if you still can’t reproduce it  then i can message you on discord about the ocr way of reproducing it 
by enabling fully static builds  it gives people the option to provide some built in cores for the user  i talked to an emulator developer who decided to not identify himself  he favors static builds and expressed disappointment in the fact libretro cores usually require position independent code  during our discussion i had this idea and decided to create an issue  it could be a valuable feature on systems that do not have these constraints  static linking simplifies dependency management  it would let people ship a fully featured retroarch frontend with their core built right into it  i've just begun exploring the source code and i'm not yet familiar with retroarch's implementation details on platforms that do not have  dlopen   how does it bind the libretro symbols in those cases  is it done at compile time  with macros  perhaps  the same mechanism can probably be used to support many statically linked cores  in its current form this convention is external to the libretro api  it's like a post processing stage for conforming libretro cores that would allow many of them to be statically linked into retroarch  other frontends will have to add support for the core name prefixes as well if they want to use the modified cores for static linking  i wasn't able to come up with an alternative design that allowed multiple statically linked cores and maintained backwards compatibility 
everything was mapped from the get go and the hotkey was automatically chosen as the logitech button in the middle of the controller on the retroarch android version  unlike retropie where you map the buttons to your controller on first launch  right after i installed and tested cores the select button didn't respond prior to me messing with anything  i just mapped the back button   select   to left thumb button for now in order to function  hopefully down the road things get worked

it is set to  vita2d   i will check if when i change to  ozone  it gets reset to  gl1   but under  xmb  menu driver it is definitely  vita2d  and everything seems to work flawlessly  would it be useful to share a screenshot  somehow  or was the explanation clear enough 
if i had to guess  this may resolve the somewhat rare issue where exiting a game hangs on the achievement load task somehow not being finished 
no way i'm sorry 
i can only select ffmpeg as the record driver  or null  here's a log but i see no error in there  https   pastebin com fs42hbzl i use a hotkey " " to start stop recording  but even using the menu "start recording" and stuff  the resulting file is the same  plays fine but it's corrupted like i mention earlier  check your output file  hover the cursor over it and check it's length  in my case it "trims" 4 seconds of the file  i don't know if the core has something to do with it  the ones i tried are fb neo  genesis gx plus and citra 
where is that info   
sure  but that's little better than just hardpatching  since the frontend already set up for softpatching  there really should be a better option than launching from the command line with a  ips flag  it would be useful in quite a few situations  and i'm not seeing any downsides to adding the option of putting the information in the playlist  i guess it breaks 6 line equivalency if used  but having the frontend automatically select a file and not having a good override stinks 
sure  where would i fine them  on thu   mar  26  2020  4 15 p m  rob loach   notifications github com  wrote

thanks for the explanation  bernd however  i noticed that when installing entities with a content pack  i can then delete them manually  i would have thought that graylog would forbid such action  and that entities created with a content pack could only be removed afterwards by uninstalling the content pack  i'm trying to provision graylog with content packs  and this behavior makes things harder to reason about  but maybe content packs are not appropriate for this task 🤔

hi  thanks for your response i thought about using  fffb03  for highlighting  it's very similar to #ffec3d   as long as it's more "highlighting" it would be a improvement  is there someway to change it by myself 
it worked with the filter  thanks 
doesn't look like it 
hi lennart  thx for your reply  i have a rabbitmq instance with an exchange and a queue  that i just typed in the configuration for the amqp input in graylog2  there is nothing like graylog2 radio or msgpack at all  i do not even know them  do have a kind of tutorial how to bring this up with rabbitmq 
oh i see  you don't need the     at all  i ended up specifying the regex more completely and anchoring it with   and   and that helped  now i can simplify though    thanks 
this happens if i uncomment all amqp_broker_   settings in graylog2 radio conf and then setup amqp input with same settings as in configuration file

it appears that the collector_sidecar yml needs to be modified to work with the new version of graylog  the server_url setting was http   rclm rwwaq com au 12900 and to get it to work i had to change it to     http   rclm rwwaq com au 9000 api  i now have to change 80 target machines manually to reflect the new url 
no errors on developer tools console  the button simply does nothing  completely inactive 
i have now received a version of the logo with a higher resolution  the purpose is for use in presentation material advocating the use of graylog in our organisation

no it's not correct  i'm missing some notifications which i can see while i browse to the notifications page  i'm only seeing 17 returned from curl and just noticed that the notification page is returning duplicate entries on page 1 and 2  so what i see is  on the first page there are 10 notifications  and on page 2 there are 10 notifications  what i'm seeing is on page 1 is notifications with title 1 10 and on page 2 i see notifications 2 11  so on page 2 i'm not seeing the top most notification entry from page 1  but i'm seeing the other 9  plus 1 extra which isn't on page 1  hope it doesn't sound to confusing  i've included 2 screenshots  where you can see the bottom of page 1 and page 2  and you can see that there are 2 identical notifcations displayed altough i only created it once  the json that curl returned is valid  i posted in duckduck go json parser    1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 26430811 23950825 9499c90c 098c 11e7 9954 99daab57713c png    2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 26430811 23950829 97791024 098c 11e7 978b 59f1ecd109fa png

i used the default notification template 
i tried using the 2 9 x in the plugin  but when installed into graylog  somehow the class loaders choosing the class from older libraries  i think there are some setting to choose a dedicated class loader for plugin  should i try go in that direction

sure  first off all it was a old dashboard from graylog 3 1  i deleted multiple widgets and added new ones  i also changed the placements of the widgets on the dashboard  and then at the end just saved it with the save button  then i went to the enterprise reports page and clicked on "contents" button which resulted in the error message posted above  if you need anything else please let me know 
yes it's openjdk 11 if it's a known bug  then it's no problem  i use the workaround tls1 2
this request is really for the _initial_ screen shown when clicking on "search" at the top of the screen   meaning when running a new search  but don't resize the widget after the initial load  the behaviour would be similar to 3 1 where you could see all messages filling up the page and any other stuff  like quick values  automatically appeared above  that is also working the same way in 3 2 already where newly added widgets like aggregation just appear above any you have to resize move them anyway if you don't like the way they are placed  it would only save the annoyance to having to resize the widget initially every time when just running a simple search like i do most of the time 
according to this https   issues apache org jira browse kafka 3166 0 9 0 1 should have support for sasl_ssl  also if i check this in 0 9 branch of kafka https   github com apache kafka search q sasl_ssl unscoped_q sasl_ssl
yes latest version    u don't need to have a phone to test it    u can just try the emulator
it's probably an issue i created myself  i implemented a zoom in   out button  pressing it will scale all objects to 0 75  this issue happens if you press say 10 times zoomout  and then 10 times zoomin  all objects are stacked on eachother  test case  var group   new fabric group canvas getobjects     canvas setactivegroup group     press button 10 times group scale 0 75   group scale 0 75   group scale 0 75   group scale 0 75   group scale 0 75   canvas renderall   
it works  thanks
ipod touch 3 
yeah  and that works fine for saving on the server  however  i need that data to be restored when using  loadfromjson  
just pulled and built the latest 
i think i found the problem    when i add an image src from the internet todatalessjson works as expected but when i add it from my computer via filereader api and after set image setsourcepath  todatalessjson does work like tojson
hm  it's broken at my localhost in chromium  but works in jsfiddle  and works in opera ff at localhost  sorry for hightlighting   
http   jsfiddle net limeyfw qgkv3 26  try drawing a line that goes from bottom left to top right 
screen shot attached   draw_error  https   f cloud github com assets 275138 1322068 09f28e58 340e 11e3 9992 17bb1a166cbd png 
function that i pointed has two arguments  https   github com kangax fabric js blob master src parser js#l379 so on this line  https   github com kangax fabric js blob master src parser js#l388 i think should be used value from id argument  variable idattr is empty and never gonna be anything else except undefined  so now it checks if id attribute is equal to 'undefind' instead of equal to id value from arguments  do you see what i mean 
thanks  calcoffset seems to resolve the issue 
after setcoords  its ok  thanks  http   jsfiddle net hellomaya mjsn7 4 
good to know there is a textbox class  and i did the same thing with char word wrap  i work around current itext limitation by wrapping text   rectangle to group and finished it  the styles lost when i tried to insert more " n" into the original text string  a native textbox is more than welcome  just a few idea  actually itext is cool  but not really useful for printing app  because in printing app  we need calculate the size of itext in metrics system  without word wrap or char wrap  it's almost useless  that's the critical feature  sometimes it doesn't matter if we can edit text directly or not
i'll try to replicate it in a separate code  since i'm currently very busy i'll try to do this in the first week of december
still wrong  i've updated the example on http   misc avoid org fabricjs bug  here's the example as zip  so you can run it locally  http   misc avoid org fabricjs bug bug zip
the area outside the rectangle is darkened  the area inside is left unchanged  my implementation was drawing redrawing a black rectangle to a canvas over the fabric canvas  using javascript   then clearing the rectangle for the area of an active fabric object   the non fabric canvas has an opacity less than 1 0   then when the user presses "save"  it just passes  x1  y1  x2  y2  for the cropping rectangle separately from the json encoded canvas   client side cropping is  in my use case  absolutely undesirable  users need to be able to come back in the future  load the original image  and readjust the cropping down the road   the exact procedure is as follows  1  draw a rectangle with no fill or border  set it to the active element  2  when a user resizes the active rectangle  re render the overlay canvas  3  when the active element is in any way unselected  delete it and save the dimensions of the cropping overlay it's a bit hacky  but it works for me  if you feel like streamlining this for a general purpose "i will crop this in php  don't do it here" type feature  that'd be pretty cool  if not  feel free to close this issue    
i create two canvas element and then try to synchronize the movement of two board  after i try to move the square at the upper board  the lower board would follow the same movement and moved by programming  however  after that  sometime i would find that i cannot move the element at the lower board by using mouse event  i don't know why it is locked like this  p s  i only implement the second board movement following the first board  but not the vice versa
its not me  look  http   jsfiddle net jva8v 1  only first animation works fine  next are just "jumping" because of "left" and "top" properties are wrongly calculated as nan  i just tracked down  that this 3rd argument is causing the problem  sorry i didn't describe it more precisely before 
fast reply  huh  thanks     yes of course  actually  i don't think that the trouble with top left and other controls  it's only rotating point issue because you dont need your top left if you moved the one outside of canvas  but the trouble with rotating point in that fact  a figure  which you moved  not moved out the canvas area  like on the screenshot  i guess when you moved your figure to canvas top rotating point can be automatically shown below the figure 
it look like uglify is simply said closure compiler with simple_optimizations  although i just started using closure compiler yesterday  with compilation_level advanced_optimizations the interested stuff is introduced  here you can read all about advanced_optimizations  https   developers google com closure compiler docs api tutorial3  it might break your code if you do not keep to code guidelines  note that minification is just a feature  and to be honest i'm not worried about a couple kb more or less    
 asturur yes i've made fabric js package for meteor but didn't publish it yet  however i'm planning to  ok no problem  email me  email is in my profile info  
well i was am writing a program that requires saving and loading of data  one thing is that we're using custom objects  like stars  special arrows  etc  which are all done with the poly line  now instead of extending the whole thing  which is not really what i want since i do not need new functionality at all  was to just set the type and differentiate this way what object the user has drawn  but as you stated that it is not supposed to be changed i will look for another way around this the next time i touch this piece of code  it currently works but i will just assume that after an update it will probably break  one thing i would still like to mention is that since this type is exposed in the documentation  maybe you could add a little note saying that it shouldn't be changed  as it breaks the loading saving if it is 
actually preserveobjectstacking is the main property of fabric class and there is no canvas preserveobjectstacking property  when you add an overlay image with transformation  it throws error
yes i am using the last version  updated 27 days ago  this is my code for adding text  var text   new fabric itext defaulttext    fontfamily  'arial'  textalign   'right'  originx   'right'  left  points x  top  points y  lockrotation  true  hascontrols  true  lockmovementx  false  fontsize  defaultfontsize  fill  '#000000'  fontstyle  'normal'  fontweight  'normal'  textdecoration  'none'    
the best i can so is show the code  it looks like you're right  it's an ordering this      https   i imgur com br3xhoa png  i've tried testing some changes  but no luck   
if  fabric util getklass obj type  async    obj clone function  res    res set   left  200  top  100     canvas1 add res         else   canvas1 add obj clone   set  left  100  top  100      
yep  tried both absolute and relative  i went back just now and tried again  this time it worked after debugging a bit  out of nowhere  i'm still wondering what really happened 
i'm using 1 6 0 rc 1  do you remember which commit it was 
i do not have the problem with a jsfiddle  i'll try to make an example as soon as possible 
i just make sample on my nodejs server like this  var text   new fabric text 'hello world'    fontfamily  'arial'  fontsize  30  fontweight  'bold'  fontstyle  'italic'  left  100  top  100  fill  'red'     canvas add text   but the fontweight and fontstyle not working  it work on chrome  i dont know why thanks
as you can see in the gif i capture  i click circle but it selected triangle    skew  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7019896 10758729 271c9c00 7cee 11e5 82da acc416a90633 gif 
sometimes a larger image may caused cotton feel generally four or five images and when i changed it to 1 6 the two fingers touch resize cannot work 
this inithiddentextarea e   this hiddentextarea focus    if the canvas size is big and double click on a textbox to edit it it  the whole page is getting scrolled to position of this textbox 
yeah its working from the browser just like the other  but once replaced mine fabric js with your fabric js from the above link  doesnt work either     what i can see    the error happens if you tap fast  i e if 1 take more than 2 seconds between tap and tap   it works perfectly   but if the taps are with a difference lower than 2 secs   the keyboard hides    and there is no way to show it again unless you cancel the edit of the itext 
when i hold the  control  key and press  a   selectall    does run  but this is incorrect behavior according to  apple  https   support apple com en us ht201236   the  command  key is seen as  e metakey  which makes things weird because  if   e keycode in this _ctrlkeysmap      e ctrlkey    e metakey      would need to become something like     if   e keycode in this _ctrlkeysmap        e ctrlkey     ismac      e metakey    ismac       as far as my knowledge goes
i'm having a hard time simplifying my code  on looking deeper  it seems like svg paths and svg images in general is misbehaving  even without cloning  originally i had been using minx  miny to get positions before after cloning  and straight cloning svg preserved the original sizes  but now it seems that cloning complicated svg objects gets resized and altered and just handled very differently

i'm sorry   i did not see your question on aug 11  back then it was android 6 x  now it's 7 0  but now when i go to that link on my mobile or my laptop  i get a blank page and an error in the javascript console saying uncaught typeerror  this getobjectscaling is not a function
 asturur thanks for your quick response  i did setup fiddle for this which replicates the issue step by step  please check this link   http   jsfiddle net varun598 jagfhh8d 22  let me know incase you require any other information from my end 
i generated the latest code  v 2 3 6  from the custom build section here   http   fabricjs com build  the previous build of 2 3 6 that was working perfectly fine was taken on 10th august  2018
 asturur apologies for the inconvenience caused  i have commented the code now  please have a look at it  the main problem is that the crop fails when we center align the image or scale the image that needs to be cropped  let me know in case something is unclear 
my real use case is much more complicated that the js fiddle i provided  i have a lot of objects in this polygon that need to be selected alone but when i move the polygon  i need that all objects within the polygon move together  is there another way to do it  i already tried catching subtarget through a group but i can't do what i want  instead  the trick was to keep all my single object and group them only when i needed  all objects are moving with the polygon  images  text  rect  circle   only the polygon doesn't move with the group  even if i remove the mouse move  it doesn't work 
hi  asturur the lastest d ts file  https   github com definitelytyped definitelytyped tree master fabricjs  i'm using the same js file version of the d ts  the property freedrawingcolor and freedrawinglinewidth are not in the  js file  but is in the type definition file  even in the latest version  any suggestion 
thank you both    i managed to fix it after reading here https   github com automattic node canvas pull 628  i removed pango  libpango1 0 dev   deleted node_modules and reinstalled  maybe this is what you meant  asturur  so it's actually a known node canvas issue  more recent versions of node canvas are having problems with pango  and it seems they haven't settled on fixing or disabling pango since the pr isn't merged  i think this is likely what  godweed did too  since pango requires cairo  and package managers often will remove packages when you remove their dependencies  i'm not sure this makes the issue "fixed"  so i'll leave it open for  asturur to decide 
yeah of course  i'd be happy to  you should get a registration email here in a bit  it's not awesome right now  it's the result of a year of learning and growing  but we have a react driven  fabric js 2 0 based rewrite around the corner  and i'll ping you when that's a thing as well 
 asturur sorry  you're right  i have a working demo here  http   codepen io paulcredmond pen grrpjp if you add some svgs using the   addsvg   button  then move them around and undo redo you'll notice they disappear  but the fabric objects can still be selected on the canvas     canvas tojson     seems to have this issue     json stringify canvas    doesn't seem to have this issue 
yes  since version 1 6 0  i didn't make test on older version 
the version is 5 0 0

i bind double click events in two ways，double clicking on the element does not make any response

i'm using an ipad pro with 2gb memory  obviously my fiddle shows an extreme case to cause the issue quickly  in our actual app it takes more time to get to the point of crashing  it seems that garbage collection never happens  is it recommended that instead of reinstantiating the fabriccanvas object i simply keep the same instance for the life of the app

is there a way to download an encapsulated version of kitchensink  i tried saving the demo site at http   fabricjs com kitchensink using chrome to the local file system but there are too many external dependencies to get it to be fully functional 
if i am grouping like this it works as expected   scope groupobjects   function  event    var activegroup   canvas fabric getactivegroup    var objectsingroup   activegroup getobjects    var clone   fabric util object clone activegroup   canvas fabric discardactivegroup    objectsingroup foreach function object    canvas fabric remove object       canvas fabric add clone     just the selection jumps around   https   www screencast com t fhu3mn3ygc the problem with fiddle in this case is that it is too simple in the fiddle and it works in there  my app is much more complex which makes it hard to make a proper fiddle

 asturur on node canvas 1 6 5 the font style "italic" is ignored  btw  can you find out the cause of the shadow problem  or shed some light on me to work round this
well  i run it in node  and i fix it in other way   thanks very much
fiddle https   jsfiddle net uv0drtpv 1 
they're not important    forgot to remove them  edit  updated 
so  the unpkg creates cdn automatically for any published npm package  the cdn can be used in development and production  currently  the npm package of fabricjs does not publish the production minified  file in the dist  could it   without this  the unpkg cdn cannot serve optimized builds as it just exposes the npm package file structure 
that's the problem   why is it always  c   and not  b  in the second function call and then  a  in the third etc    the code should be equal to what the  insert  key does in windows 
updated with fiddle  _shakes tiny fist_ i am rending many hundreds of objects without perceivable performance degradation  but i'd be delighted if you figure out a better answer 
well  it's not for security only  in the case of my company we use fabric in several reusable components  and it would be very useful to decouple this logic between this components  for me this event would help to have a cleaner code  for example  i could extend the canvas class  and add this logic in the canvas instead of create a method helper out of the canvas that it's harder to re use between components  in this way  all the logic stays in the canvas  the other option is using the object added event but this is worst in performance  as i explained in my previous comment  this way forces me to render twice  or even worst  also forces me to setsrc because the image is dynamic and the filter is applied in the server    i hope i explained myself well  my english is not very fluent  man_facepalming 
i don't understand what you mean with your first sentence  but my expected behavior would probably be that you can only resize an object once it's been selected  which i think is a standard for many image editing apps  and you can move it without first having to select it  i e  you can click down and immediately start the drag  once it is selected  i would expect it to always have a minimum area at the center which i can use to drag it around  possibly slightly offsetting the resize controls  but i see that for example pixelmator pro gives higher priority to the resize controls in this case 
2 1 0 has below change at the end of fabric js  when i remove it  it works    if  typeof define     "function"    define amd    define     function     return fabric         
i agree both percentage and pixel crops would be helpful depending on the scenario  regarding  asturur point  if the percentage logic is implemented inside the library  it would be once and for all  and more optimized than 3rd party implementations  btw  are you considering introducing a built it crop tool at some time 
so as far as being "dynamic"  in our use case  we are wanting a jpeg after designing that has specific dimensions  in the fiddle above  the canvas is actually 1600 w x 1200 h and will give a jpeg that size when using todataurl    but   we are displaying and working with the canvas in a viewport that is sometimes smaller than what the canvas is configured to be  so it is "dynamically" sized with css  essentially making the canvas responsive  in regards to what you mentioned about updates to   setdimensions    any adjustments to the browser size can resize the canvas on the fly  we're not calling setdimensions on browser resize  but letting css deal with the resizing of the canvas   you can see this working in the fiddle if you resize the display pane or the browser   all the parts of fabric we have used so far seems to work fine with this css responsive sizing of the canvas  as far as correct relative coordinates  etc  are you thinking that the pr i submitted will have some other unexpected effects or negative performance impact

 asturur  jilster https   jsfiddle net pvwue1y0 24  i set it up with two images  seems like it works with small not scaled image and doesn't work with large scaled images  please see in fiddle example with photo1 and photo2  replace the variable in the code to see the difference 
i want to allow the users to draw a filled shape using freedrawing  i want them to see the filled part while drawing 
i cover it in that last paragraph above   pasting below 
 asturur find only this one when i used the libary in wechat  it reported the errors like below   img src "https   user images githubusercontent com 16495602 39160623 dd1aa024 479e 11e8 9939 d335714d8fd4 jpg" width "30 "  i used the filter functions to dynamically change some images's colors  till i encountered this problem 
 asturur found the reason   clipto  causes it  it was caused by   but i think it's also an issue 
 espindolaa i have this working as the web version   but the above is using nodejs  node canvas  and fabricjs   on the website it works fine
i tried to scroll the canvas by sliding the screen with one finger 
i inserted the active snippet  it is hard to say how much they are different from what i aspect  because this depends on the number of objects involved in the selection 
thank you very much for your reply my fiddle http   jsfiddle net aqnruw39 8  so sorry my chinese font cannot be uploaded normally   font face   font family  ff    chinese font   src  url 'http   diy zheliyin com diyweb assets resource files mxyz c98e481ee1d548c5b0d66ac54c6ac537 ttf'     i think it could be a network problem
 asturur for browser in reactjs  where can i find the browser version   npm install fabric  installs the node version right  
the entire image rendered over the original one is blurry  i think this may have something to do with objectcaching of groups since the overlay image is in a group  in this fiddle this may not be necessary but in our projects use case it is  we basically render these images on their original scale and then zoom the canvas out  i have attached some screenshots from our project to clarify   screen shot 2020 03 02 at 8 52 40 am  https   user images githubusercontent com 39048448 75656010 55400c80 5c63 11ea 9121 9db33f19c14d jpg    screen shot 2020 03 02 at 8 52 49 am  https   user images githubusercontent com 39048448 75656012 56713980 5c63 11ea 8cf8 36435dbfd952 jpg

here is a video showing the delete issue  this happens after you view the "source code" but it will also happen when pasting from an outside source that doesn't have the br tags   tinymce deleting list issue zip  https   github com tinymce tinymce files 370198 tinymce deleting list issue zip 
hi   yes you can test here   on windows ie9+ http   fiddle tinymce com lcfaab 1 look the fiddle description's
firefox 50  chrome 54   55  and edge 14  the popup with   top   and   bottom   belongs to the url input field in the "insert link" dialog  it seems to be some autocomplete feature    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10222521 20828635 c4badcda b878 11e6 9169 b76174080efa png  this could probably be fixed by using the  datalist  element instead of relying on a custom autocomplete implementation 
oh yeah it remove style when we put class manually  but it will not remove style if the class is put by program itself  i slightly modify  your fiddle  http   fiddle tinymce com kjfaab 1  to reproduce the problem
it fails when querying the document for node by its id and trying to set an attribute on it  the node is created but react hasn't added to the document yet  i could not manage to create a simple reproduction  since it is only failing in a large project that i have    let me try again and see if i can make it happen in a simpler example  but anyways  in case anyone sees this  i was able to make it work by doing 
 donshakespeare me too  i´m pretty sure i have seen this before   more then a year ago  still i´m not getting the point  deleted every non stock css  i resetted every setting to stock  it´s the "out of the box" tinymce with default menus etc  any idea 
 kuresov yes  it is similar for me  but i mentioned that there is no error if tinymce didn't have any initial value  only with some initialized value  so  this behavior can be named unstable  also i discovered  that in normal  no error  case  but after destroy it has htmlelement value of tinymce body element  so  it has different types and not seems like race condition 
yes  this is working fine as shown in fiddle  but we are using this html file in another html file using html iframe tag  i e   html   body   iframe src "tinymcetest html" width "500" height "500"   iframe    body    html  tinymcetest html contains content for all components as displayed in fiddle  there it is loading all its components but not able to insert component in ie  always take cursor to the starting point 
no  i want to know where the doc is saved  fs dir or database    when i run tinymce on node js vm  
 blackcathikari tldr  the justification is security  google chrome  and other browsers  have a similar auto append protocol feature for urls entered into the navigation bar  they default to https    as this is the secure protocol  when a naive consumer of an application that uses tinymce adds a link via the editor  they may not be aware of the consequences of http    over https     more browsers and security experts are pushing site to support https     having a configuration option to specify default would also solve my use case  thank you for raising this to the team 
hey  blackcathikari just few minutes ago i got it working  i had to put  import "               node_modules tinymce skins ui oxide skin mobile min css"  for my scss compiler and now mobile skin works  i am still confused between skin and theme and somewhere i've read that it's better to disable skin if you import it in typescript like i did  does it make any sense  or should i get it done differently 
 alyrik right now when a user tries to navigate back  i check if  document body classname    'tinymce mobile android scroll reload'  and prevent the navigation  but that is just a bare minimum  quite far from ideal
hi  i've done some more digging and it seems like it's to do with devices that report touch as their primary input source  eg microsoft surface devices  many hybrids  and i've also confirmed on an android phone with a mouse attached   when the editor initialises on a device with touch as the primary input  the mouse handlers don't seem to be hooked up  interestingly this only started affecting us yesterday  but seems to have affected others earlier  now that i know the exact scenario  it seems that this issue is already tracked in https   github com tinymce tinymce issues 5310  therefore my issue is a duplicate 
no  sorry   just tested under chrome   it doesn't know setcapture   releasecapture      
i load the geojson depending on the current map bounds  but i can't remove the existing geojsonlayer
hi thanks for reply in fact i've already have the solution yesterday evening however now i have another issue   i want to change the icon image  size when zooming i was wondering if there was someone who has ever done this can i ask it here or should i open another issue 
i found the issue   had to add the background image to the following css definition   leaflet touch  leaflet control layers toggle   background image url images layers png   width  44px  height  44px     anzel  are you sure that this is no general leaflet issue  as far as i understand the css here  on touch devices no background is set at all 
thanks  works like a charme  this should be mentioned somewhere   
like a charm  thanks 
it happened because just reference to leaflet js had been updated  leaflet css was still old  quietly closing this one  thanks for the hint 
 mourner i'm not using the master and need to put together a page for testing  i'm using the kml plugin  xml  to load the the polyines and polygons  https   github com shramov leaflet plugins  fswidgets it is a webapp that runs fullscreen on the ipad  using html5  css3 and javascript 
 mourner   it should do  e g  https   github com cloudmade leaflet zipball f7229cef8244f42766b9297c1d329942a8148d15 is a zip file of the latest commit from the gh pages branch 
it appears that you can recreate this for a brief moment before leaflet removes the old layer in mobile safari  unfortunately i do not have access to an ipad 2 
no  a string of copyright 
yes  it is  for example  wms after the zoom in 2+ levels loading a lot of unnecessary tiles  if the tiles are rendered in real time is expensive 
i am on 0 5 1  i will try master  what version is leafletjs com  i experience the same problem there 
it seems it works in firefox but not chrome  why would crs simple make a difference 
i'll try to do jsfiddle as soon i have the time to do so  here is some images to understand what happens  step 1   click on a button to draw a heatmap around paris    heatmapidf  https   f cloud github com assets 4759058 716368 5c17b64c df34 11e2 8e15 2c4d045cf2c8 png  result  as expected  a heatmap around paris  step 2  click on a button to draw a heatmap in the east    heatmpap2  https   f cloud github com assets 4759058 716375 7f363a68 df34 11e2 822b a16d5b7a52cb png  result  the second heatmap is added  but the one around paris erased   error  step 3  click on the plus icon to zoom on the map   heatmapne  https   f cloud github com assets 4759058 716386 ac34732c df34 11e2 958e 41c1829febe0 png  result  zoom as intended  and the heatmap around paris disappear 
on leaflet website no example which are effected  this bug i have only in one page on my server  http   m limpteam ru  and only in firefox 23+ on windows  3 computers at least   so you can see it on http   m limpteam ru map php  zoom in out  drag map etc   i checked my code but couldn't find anything wrong  pic    bug  https   f cloud github com assets 3147354 1039889 1b3f0668 0fa2 11e3 8dcf a3eae08d78b0 png  uncheck "hardware acceleration" in firefox fixes this issue but font appears to be more unreadable 
yes  what you said for the latter point 
meant trigger it ad hoc outside leaflet  thanks for the answer  i was basically looking for if there is a way to trigger zoom through script instead of user clicking  i was looking for fireevent "zoom in"  and went the wrong route  thanks 
thanks for the suggestion  i think i may have found the root cause  it is not related to leaflet  it is due to the selection box calling map remove event twice  then leaflet certainly should throw that error since nothing is created after remove 
 jfirebaugh i don't have a jsfiddle for this one  i am not sure if you guys had any generic jsfiddle that loads some tiles in leaflet  this one prob has nothing to do with our specific app but the drag and drop handling on tablet  i wonder what  this  would be on that line of code 
 mourner we'll try to deploy the 0 7 3 in about 2 weeks and see what the system finds 
 mourner i will try a playground with some simple geojson and see what happens  i haven't had the click handler code broken in very isolated examples  i even debugged to the layer object in debugger   the click handler is definitely added  a click event is triggered on the tile   img   when i click on the layers  i can't think of any other factors impacting this 
ok  i've gone through all the code again  have to get used to the refactored version yet  nevertheless  i wasn't able to achieve a simple nowrap  my first try was to set crs wraplat and crs wraplng to null  i did this directly in crs js  but there was no change at all  i added the line "crs wraplng   null " to gridlayer js in line 329  the map is now displayed once  but the order of tiles is messed up as soon as i zoom in   mourner  can you show me how it is done correctly in dev 0 8  i noticed something different while going through the code of dev 0 8  having bounds near 90 extend the bounds vertically far outside the map  this behaviour was different in 0 7 1  please  see bottom jsfiddle for demonstration  current dev 0 8  http   jsfiddle net fl2tu 24  stable 0 7 1  http   jsfiddle net 9j5mb 11 
i will try and create a jsfiddle for the issue  it may not happen until some time tuesday 
yes i can  i try asap  our project quite big  and i hope we can reproduce it in jsfiddle  we have bootstrap but not see any problem before last chrome version  i keep you in touch 
i have tried the latest master version just now  it's still the same 
may take some time to figure out fiddler in chrome  i use firebug debugging in firefox and there is no javascript error in that  i bet there are no errors in chrome either 
linux  asus ux31a  etps 2 elantech touchpad  chromium 35  firefox 30  konqueror  qtwebkit   any browser that supports horizontal scroll events is affected  any system with a touchpad that has two three four …  finger scrolling in both vertical and horizontal directions should be affected  afaik 
sorry for my bad english   the problem is solved   the problem was because of bouncing on zoom limits    i've just set it to false but the problem is still present if i want bouncing on zoom limits   it may be because of bad performance of the android   it's 1500mhz proccessor  
yes  it does fix it  thank you  however  i still think there's a bug in leaflet  it doesn't get broken if the map is visible  i'd say invalidatesize   is just a workaround  i don't think i should monitor if print was called to invalidatesize after printing  if it's even possible to detect after printing all browser versions   thank you anyway 
i got it working while messing with the fiddle  your comment lead me to the solution  thanks  http   jsfiddle net ey2yx5nc  i have implemented responsive popup windows my own way using jquery  but can make it a little neater this way  do you think it's you might like to add to the package  i could submit a pull request if you think it would be useful   it would have to include a pantopopup method too as this is about centering to the popup rather than the marker  cheers  dave
hi danzel  thank you for writing  actually  for now  i just need a marker clusterer for the titanium map  http   docs appcelerator com titanium 3 0 #  api modules map   i already use a changed version of the latlng and latlngbounds classes because they conform the their google map counterparts and the projects shares a common code base with a backbone jquery mobile web app  my thinking was to also change the leaflet markercluster plugin so i can use it in the project  then i thought  even better would be to just render the whole leaflet map  titanium would then have a good  flexible map with lot's of plugins  i don't know much about how leaflet map rendering works  that's why i decided to ask    what do you think  is it possible  does it make sense  thanks again  cheers andré
that works  thanks a lot 
yes  it's fixed on 0 8 dev thanks
i can try  i will work on it now  it may be difficult to reproduce though 
that just seems to defeat the purpose a bit  the layer control obviously stores the layers somewhere  so it would be great to be able to access that 
strange that you can't load that page  we actually use our own clustering   that page  that didn't load  has on it about 150 markers  indicating cities  and clicking on one dives in  to expose the real estate listing markers "underneath"  thanks for the pointer  might be really useful for us

hmmm  actually  i'm also getting this with 0 7 3    screenshot from 2015 08 25 02 55 53  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 297678 9463929 f54f1838 4ad4 11e5 90a3 e7bc33dcbf42 png  let me see if i can make a reproduction 
overriding the  _bringtofront back  implementation for the vml renderer fixed the issue  but highlights another bug which i have made another issue for here #3042 
hi  this will happend under very special circumstances  i think  i don't know if it's possible to repoduce in jsfiddle
http   playground leaflet rhcloud com nayod 1 edit html output click the new control   it should have orange border after clicking 
it's not really a problem or a bug  but rather a feature request  every point of interest in my map  both generated by users and from external apis such as wikipedia  has a location and a title  then i usually attach a popup with more data  image  link  some text  etc   maybe  title  is too specific and the requirement that should be supported is something like  externaldata  which the developer can use to put anything in when creating the marker and use later when one need to get the data out  for example for identification etc  in any case  my most basic data object related to a marker  the data that is saved in my database for example  has latlng and title  the same was implemented in jts for segments and lines and was very useful 
i was not able to successfully isolate this issue in jsfiddle using angular   so i suspect i would not be able to isolate without angular either  here is my attempt  http   jsfiddle net ml6s2wdb 3   but as you see the drawing works fine  closing for now   i will reopen if things change 
had my accessibility consultant review  mlegoff demo site looks good  and he also says ok to make the change only for keyboard users and leave current mouse behaviour alone 
not a leaflet issue  i have something conflicting here 
using windows 8 1  i recorded it in action  which you can see here  http   opticraft net leaflet chrome crash swf
it does indeed appear to be connected to the maxbounds property  i commented it out and then the map works exactly as expected in all four browsers i tested it in  here’s the code i’m using to set up the map   a lot of the things in the code above are supplied via a config object that’s passed to the function creating the map  the projection is created using the proj4 plugin  and the bounds are generated from some coordinates passed in and reprojected by the proj4 plugin  commenting out the "maxbounds" line in the map creation block has solved the immediate issue  but now of course users can scroll the map way outside the area i want them to see  so it’s not a great solution really 
system  windows 8  64 bit  seems to happen when i repeatedly press ctrl + f5 looks like a   chrome cache problem   or so    i sometimes see parts of the rest of the page in the picture  looks like i'm at the wrong place then     i close this issue   screenshot_2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6714237 6202390 4fe0b334 b4e8 11e4 9ff9 643635679f85 png 
sorry for my delayed reply  very likely your first suggestion did that trick  i will test the behavior of the map in different contexts but i am quite confident that it is working right now  so thanks for your quick and helpful reply  i will close this issue now 
at the moment i am unable to provide access to this page as it is behind a login gate and i do not have authorization to bypass this  i can provide stack trace information 
less code   no additional plugin to get the functionality i think it much simpler to do it this way    you can also use similar existing code from openlayer eg 
here is a code pen showing the mouse event triggers  it shows the tooltip on some states disappearing b c of mouse event sequence  it happens only on canvas rendering  http   codepen io anon pen jdpdav    canvas version http   codepen io anon pen rvjvqg    svg version another unrelated issue i found is  overlapping layers like circles drawn on each state  randomly disappear when you change styles of state layers on mouse over event  the problem can be seen on the same code pen  i can create a new issue  this also happens on the canvas drawing only     thanks for a great library  saved me a lot of time on many projects  the performance on the new version of leaflet is impressive  i was looking to upgrade 
i have narrowed the test case to 2 state layers and each state layer contain 1 circle layer  i noticed    when you change style of state layer using mouseover event  circles in other state layer disappear    the problem in this test case does not exist on zoom 4 or less    when you pan the map the circles appear again  http   codepen io anon pen rvdrrd
it's obvious how to modify my own css to give divs a larger z index  but the issue is compatibility with a large library like jqueryui  which had no previous problems  it's not reasonable to have to modify the jqueryui code itself to enable inter operability  though i haven't looked yet for means of specifying the use of z index values for modals and other widgets    i'm going to look this morning  regardless  the usage and values of z index in leaflet needs to be well documented in order for developers to anticipate such issues 
unfortunatly i can't provide an example at the moment  as additional information  i'm using https   github com stefanocudini leaflet layerjson for building the markers out of a json response from my server api
take a look at this  https   jsfiddle net u4xzasuu  i think it would be good if we could bring the first popup in front of the other one by clicking on it 
https   jsfiddle net julievelghe 6mzbexpj 3  this is the fiddle  it seems to work  however on the site i still have the problem  http   mapshop aquaterra be collections country products albania_08  password is  breats 
not at the moment  but i will later  anyway    forgetting performance   shouldn't that svg be deleted  there's no sense having that svg translating 3d and triggering events    or there is  thanks for the reply
http   jsfiddle net vagy5 476  i want to remove "square" layer if zoom is under 10
here's the stack trace on the unminified version retrieved from the dowloads page
ok  seems to work on latest development version  thanks 
i think it is a question of perspective     the mouse don’t move on the screen or on the map element  but the coordinate for the mouse is changed when the map is panned using the keyboard my current use case is simple to display the coordinates of the cursor on the map  the moveend  zoomend events only provides event not mouseevent it isn’t implemented in js either   if the position of an element is changed while the mouse is over it  no mousemove event is fired i have fixed it for now by turning the coordinate display off on zoomstart movestart events and turning it back on at zoomend moveend i will look into it at some point to see if an easy method can be implemented
shows the error for me on versions edge  10 and 9 using developer tools in ie 
the simple case playground seems to work for all versions  http   playground leaflet rhcloud com lit 1 edit html console output however  running my page from my local machine  and trying 1 0 beta 2  1 0 rc 1 from the cdn  and the latest snapshot from amazonws  only the latest snapshot works properly  below is console log output  for the rc and beta versions  the dblclick event goes through to the map  not sure what to make of it  other than if it's working in the latest snapshot  i presume that will be in the final release  i guess i'd close this unless you would like to investigate further 
oh i'm sorry  jsfiddle   try click remove layer button   leaflet remove only blue polygon  don't remove red and blue    i need to remove all polygon in my array   storagelayerid    http   jsfiddle net pe5xu 583   http   jsfiddle net pe5xu 583    perliedman
 ivansanchez each ie in which leaflet works  include edge
yes  the problem still exists in rc3  i added a debugging statement to the middle of the test to confirm that i'm using the correct version 
sorry  i am new in github  after other tests i have found the problem  it was because all the layers were loaded with tiles that take a lot of times  we use the plugin  leaflet nontiledlayer  https   github com ptv logistics leaflet nontiledlayer  which gets the imagery for the complete map viewport whenever it changes  this plugin has resolved the problem  thank you for your help and for the fiddle site  aurélie
well  it turns out that when updating to the latest leaflet 1 0 0 rc 3  i forgot to replace css file  really embarrassing 
 ivansanchez  jwoyame the project uses angular 2 so i guess zone js could be the culprit 
bug visible in old version of embeded chromium browser for delphi 
thanks for your quick answer  i have tested on desktops  ubuntu 16 04 and macos 10 12 1 for now  not using touchscreen 
i couldn't reproduce it in an isolated case  if you visit ride lyft com  you will need to login  the snap to current location is not working properly  we're getting current user location using the geolocation api and setting the lat lng using the  setview  function  i understand it would be almost impossible for you to detect the issue without seeing the code  i'll try to make a failing test case in meanwhile 
hi  samik88  as i specified in the use case  the colour  an rgb colour code  of the marker icon is retrieved from a database with the marker coordinates  so it is not possible to define it in a css class  to do so would involve creating 16777215 css classes  one for each rgb colour code not including opacity   which would be a stupid thing to do   you can change your example to see the use case by adding a text field that you can enter an rgb colour for the marker and then you will find you cannot set that on the divicon and so cannot change the marker icon colour  to do that would would involve being able to set the css style attribute on the generated div
 ivansanchez ah  i figured out this issue  we can use layer groups  as shown in this excellent  tutorial  http   leafletjs com examples layers control    to show exactly the layers that we want 
sorry it seems to be some error caused by a method which ran before the leaflet js files were completely loaded    so i'm closing it
does someone know if that can bee prevented through the touch action idea from  ghalko  is there a workaround to use the map as described in this issue  i want to switch from google maps to osm with leaflet but this issue prevents this because the webapp would not be really usable with this issue   
if i click on zoom out     the image is going somewhere to see i have to use scroll or drag fiddle here  https   jsfiddle net 12svpgx7  the image used here is of dimension 1920x1080
my apologies  i am unable to create a test at this time  as it would require tons of retyping manual copying from a non connected system  basically  adding in the boxzoom control to an existing leaflet map causes this behavior  this happens on the first time the boxzoom is used 
i have difficulty reproduce error without my self data  but the essence of rewriting "len" 
i guess i could but it seems a bit obvious  in getzoomscale code you have  and crs scale tozoom  is obviously going to fail to if tozoom   crs scale length 
 perliedman  ah  i hadn't thought of that  classname  option  that's much more elegant  yes  this solution works perfectly fine for us  since we don't officially support any of the browsers that don't work with this   the app is desktop oriented  not mobile  and expects modern browsers  i just wanted to point out the use case and how we went at tit  as for leaflet  i guess the main improvement would be documentation of this possibility so that others won't have to search for it     either in the docs  or in a linked example   ivansanchez  are you sure webgl has wider support than this css option  another issue could be the probably extremely rare but still valid use case of having multiple instances  you can have as many 2d canvas elements as you want  but webgl is a different story  i have a similar problem in that professors regularly want to  get this  _print out webpages_  and because of that i'm semi stuck with 2d canvas elements instead of  more performant "one webgl view overlaying everything faking scrolling elements" hacks  http   idyll lang org idyll regl component    of course there could be a canvas based fallback for that situation

hello alexander  hmm  but this happens in loop  my application every 20 seconds defines exists or not exists network connection  also my application can execute different linux commands such as reboot  poweroff and behavior is similar  yes of cause i can use syscall system method for calling simple command but if i need work with command output that it is right only process class  rarely i observed such situation on ssd with disconnected swap  but this case is with connected swap  additionally i think maybe this happens when connection with operating system and hdd is missing on working linux  my application works on more than 2000 atms and sometimes such connection really missing  but first   i can not recognize it remotely and second   maybe it needs to write more exactly description of exception message
this is not osx however iirc osx does not have real thread local storage either and only emutls is available from the compilers 
different issue i think  the other one was httpwebrequest methods 
i am seeing this on windows 10  when debugging a asp  net core app in vscode
 sehuff   no  this was fixed a 21 days ago  it would need to be integration with a new xamarin ios or mac release for you to likely see the fix   steveisok   is this worth safe for 2019 08 or does it need to be  10 only 
when i looked through things i didn't see any way to get info out of it  it just expects the code to fail verification  presumably what we'd need to do is run each one on coreclr and then see what kind of verification failure happens  then figure out why it fails  and match it

 mono android dll zip  https   github com mono mono files 2757206 mono android dll zip  here you go  on my end  it seems pretty easy to reproduce  which is weird  however  the last master i tested on is 9 1 199 72  which is not exactly brand new  i reported the issue in xamarin android essentially a month ago  
i was installed but when i tried to rebuild it to check if this would change anything  i came across the actual issue  giflib removed gifquantizebuffer which is deprecated and that broke libgdiplus  so it wasn't an issue with mono  the giflib update just coincided with me preparing the mono update  i patched our giflib package to fix this issue for now 
fixed by #18377

hi david  i just pulled your changes and updated django sentry in my project  it still gets in an infinite recursion loop  after seeing where you changed your code  i tried to find out why it's breaking  but hell this is hard  your  sentry utils __init py__  is one of the hardest pieces of code to follow i've seen  d  some doc strings would help  after playing around with the recursion error handler  i've found that it's a template rendering that detonates this  well the template rendering  detonates something in djdt that sentry tries to log and when creating the groupedmessage  djdt captures that sql and everything starts again  i'm getting exactly the same traceback  this time i've logged in a file the parameter  value  in  transform  function and this is what happens  as you can see it captures the template rendering and then you see apps versions again and again till it collapses   pre   lt  head gt   lt body gt   lt div id "wrapper" gt   lt div id "topbar" gt   lt div id "topbarinner" gt   '__sentry__'   'versions'   'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'     'versions'   'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'    'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'  0 8 0 0 8 5 1 8 5 1 0 2 0 0 3 1 0 3 0 1 3 0 2 0 0 2 4 0 6 0 9 3 0 8 alpha 1  '__sentry__'   'versions'   'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'     'versions'   'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'    'uni_form'  '0 8 0'  'debug_toolbar'  '0 8 5'  'sentry'  '1 8 5 1'  'fixture_generator'  '0 2 0'  'social_auth'  '0 3 1'  'indexer'  '0 3 0'  'django'  '1 3'  'captcha'  '0 2 0'  'paging'  '0 2 4'  'django_extensions'  '0 6'  'taggit'  '0 9 3'  'registration'  '0 8 alpha 1'  0 8 0 0 8 5 1 8 5 1 0 2 0 0 3 1 0 3 0 1 3 0 2 0 0 2 4 0 6 0 9 3 0 8 alpha 1   pre  thanks for being so fast in trying to fix this  cheers miguel

i don't want to describe our situation too much but we've got a class of problems that are probably related and we're investigating so it would be nice to be able to tag them  grouping is a much too aggressive action for this  single tags instead of key value would cover our use cases fine 
ok  how can i do it

mm  i don't really see an easy way to test with sentry io  probably a separate bug but   doesn't get picked up by the onboarding page  i'll wait for a release to test  unless someone else can test more easily  
i don't make any changes to my system  when i copy the error redis data to a new redis server  can't reproduce the issue  sentry worked without any problem  the redis version is 4 0 6  postgresql server version is 11  sentry start command is as below 
if i look at the  sentry_integration  table  it shows only one integration   github  is it even possible to setup the same integration twice 
i changed  system internal url prefix  because i was not able to access sentry from  http   web 9000  without modifying my host file  changing it to  http   localhost 9000  allowed me to view my local instance in a web browser  for  symbolicator options   i assumed leaving it as  http   symbolicator 3021  would have the same issue as above  so i also changed that to  localhost   i should add that i was able to get an instance up and running with these configurations  and fully tested with a demo c# application  thought this was a few days ago  yesterday  i decided to set up a development instance on a different machine  doing exactly what i did the first time  and that's when i started getting the errors shown above  the only difference i noticed yesterday was the build version  apparently  onpremise  pulls directly from github  rather than a stable build and the lack of any type of  versioning  made me give up on it entirely  but i digress  are those values not supposed to be changed  i don't know of any situation where  http   web 9000   will resolve on my local machine unless i modify my host file and point  web  to something

thanks a lot for your support    it fixed my issue  i was thinking to use sys stdout with buffer set to zero  but i explained the reason why i didn't want to use it  on the other hand i didn't knew that the whole script can also run in unbuffered mode  however  everybody should be aware of this issue that might happen with some other language 
hello  adding a variable  i couldn't save at at all 
hello greg  monday  may 11  2015  2 29 29 pm  you wrote  which documentation page were you looking at  the authenticating users page in the admin guide has the correct info  http   rundeck org docs administration authenticating users html#propertyfileloginmodule — reply to this email directly or view it on github  i had the wrong version of the documentation apparently  my bad  ## best regards  corey mailto ctgaff gmail com
moving the tomcat installation to a path without spaces has fixed the problem  rundeck starts up fine  i have another issue now  in that i can login to the rundeck ui but as soon as i have logged in i get a 404 response from http   localhost 8080 rundeck menu home   i guess that's a different issue though 
i  now  understand the chicken egg scenario  but from a debugging perspective the info is useful  couldn't rundeck just send the output log in the notification as it is at that time  which means that the notification debug info is only available in the web ui

 gschueler  thanks for referencing the "job libraries" proposal  that should be equally well suited to cut down on duplication and drift between jobs 
 ahonor this is a vmware vm with 4cpu and 8gb memory  esx 6  current jvm settings are default rdeck_jvm_settings "  rdeck_jvm_settings    xmx1024m  xms256m  xx maxpermsize 256m  server " only config i have changed is below rdeck_projects " var rundeck projects2" jaas_conf " etc rundeck jaas ldap conf" login_module "ldap" this build is the hardened one for the company i work for but as the rundeck i am working on is current build with latest rundeck and java i am a bit confused  the strange part is this was working ok on rundeck v 2 6 7 with a set of patches from around june time it is when we moved to latest el7 patches on a fresh build that this has come up  i do plan on spinning up a non corporate build when i get home to look see if i can reproduce this

thanks  my code changes had caused duplicate names in url  closing ticket 
it is a progam in my local computer  xming https   sourceforge net projects xming 
yeah  i checked that before i opened the issue  but i figured i'd be sure  i copied and pasted the url from the file into my browser after restarting  but i decided on a whim to put it into ms edge this time  i got in on the first try  i restarted and pasted it into chrome   double login  this time i actually looked at the url and noticed this" user login jsessionid    " garbage  i restarted again  pasted the url again  i e   http   hostname com 4440  into the browser  hit enter  and either rundeck or chrome slid the jsessionid in there  after the first login attempt  the nonsense after jsessionid changed and i was able to get in fine  other attempts with edge always worked on the first try but i noticed it was adding the jsessionid to the url too  a minimal amount of googling got me  this  https   stackoverflow com questions 8880592 chrome and jsessionid   i know it's 5 years old  but it seems to look like the same thing  it has a lot of the same vocabulary  e g   grails  chrome  jsessionid  "login again"  
hey  gschueler  sorry for the delay in replying i was on holiday  the authentication system in use is default  using  org eclipse jetty jaas spi propertyfileloginmodule  and the users and passwords are stored in the realm properties file with crypt passwords and the groups that the user should be assigned to  we are unsure what page triggers the exception but once it has been triggered it causes everyone to be unable to login to the server  would it be possible to add a check to the code so that if a session is found without subject then the session is invalidated  effectively logging out that user  which would prevent this from causing everyone to be unable to login  thanks  alan jenkins

thanks for the response  we gave them both admin and the generate_user_token so i'm guessing rundeck ignored the second part and just provided admin access  removing the admin part fixed it  thanks again 
 gschueler see xml 
 gschueler correct  execution level logs  such as details about a copy file failure should be filterable  for example  some jobs have a filecopy option that might not be used  if it's not used  i would like the ability to filter an error message created by a blank file 
as a workaround add this to rundeck config  datasource pooled true datasource properties removeabandoned true datasource properties removeabandonedtimeout 18000 datasource properties testonborrow true datasource properties logabandoned true datasource properties maxactive 3000 timeout must be greater than a maximum time which takes the longest running single step of your job  eg  a step in your job takes 60 minutes to finish  than this timeout must be greater than this value otherwise it would close the db connection associated with that running job  maxactive is setting maximum number of active connections additionaly make sure your ulimits are high enough  tomas

ah  thanks for your help tito  that was indeed my issue 
rebooted my laptop and it was working correctly  after some tries it stopped working again  i suspect some issues of my python installation  ubuntu 12 04 
tabbedpanel and accordion are basically the same concept  hidden pannels where only one can be shown at a time  with buttons to choose which one  the api for accordion is simple  straightforward  and well separated  the container accordion describes the overall layout  and the nested accordionitems describe each individual panel  if i understand the documentation of the proposed api for tabbedpanel introduces a concept unique in kivy  content referencing  the panel is described by its header  tabbedpanelheader  which has a binding property "content"  which is a reference to the id of a widget declared somewhere else  moreover  the content of the first panel is a special case called "default tab"  which is described inside the tabbedpanel itself  unlike the other panels  its text is set by the property default_tab_text  not 'text' like the other panels  this one uses nesting for its content  not referencing   and who decided the first one has to be the "default"   this could be a legitimate api if we didn't already have accordion doing things differently  i'm not a big fan of the referencing of outside widgets as content  nesting is a much better model   and the first panel special case is just wrong from a design standpoint  this is just bad design to have two completely different apis for two similar concepts  the fact that the example in the document doesn't work certainly doesn't help   on a side note  please don't use experimental widgets such as rstdocument in your examples  this is confusing since it's not in the main documentation   after experimenting quite a bit with the tabbedpanel to replace my accordions  in kv language   i find them very hard to design with  for instance  re ordering the tabs is not trivial if it involves the so called "default tab"  also  one should be able to switch between accodion and tabbedpanel very easily to try different models  which is not the case right now  the behavior is also strange  for instance often times the content widgets are displayed in the layout  until the tabs are pressed  which then "swallows" them in the tabbedpanel  this is clearly implementation bugs  not a design issue  but it is fairly obvious that these bugs stem from the content referencing design choice  at this point  my conclusion is that the tabbedpanel widget should not be used and needs a complete api de resign on the model of the accordion widget 
sure  i should have it tomorrow  thank you for being willing to help

i used 1 7 1 back then and when i switched to 1 8 i think it worked after a restart of the app  the modules do not react on config changes as they determine the value at import  i assume that is the cause you have to restart the app  as i don't like the whole thing and would rather see a configurable key to set an exit key i implemented that  see my fork   which i personally like better  if you like it  take it  i wont do a pr as i assume you don't     i removed the osx code  ctrl q  and would suggest to move that to the config module to have ctrl q on osx and escape elsewhere as default  i think having a list of exit keys would be a overkill

the issue is i can't find text when it contains umlauts  this is a method from "kivy examples widgets compound_selection py" i try to use   in addition i want to adapt this method  so the selection is updated with each new keystroke  so i don't have to type in the whole word  thanks for merging that timeout thing 
keyweeusr  you may be on to something  just based on my own testing  it seems that when the max fps is set to 60  i get the most errors  changing it to higher or lower values seem to decrease the error rate  a setting of about 5fps seems to eliminate the errors and triple digit settings seem to drastically reduce the error rate  but not eliminate it  of course  these are not scientifically calculated error rates

 tshirtman first  cool gist with the sliding image dependent on time     second  i can confirm that i do see that the grey circle disappears in the second layout in your gist  q  why does the int   around the pos 0  argument fix the issue  both images are sized at 601 601  but the int on the position seems to be what makes the circle disappear  i can confirm that the 'anti aliasing' option needs to be set to "none" for your gist to work  if the anti aliasing option is not none for either png or png8 a circle is seen around both images in the gist   akshayaurora yes  on a mac retina  i did see that comment  i guess i could not figure out what   i don't see a way around that or are there other ways

yip  works nicely now  cursor still shows  of course  but there's not much you can do about that   though i suppose you could specify a transparent image as a cursor on the same timeout  if you wanted to  that's no big deal  though  of course

hey heff  i downloaded a fresh copy  opened demo html and it works in both  so why won't it work on my page then  well after a lot of digging  here it is   i deleted this because the people upstairs don't want a download option  apparently the no video class is mandatory because the controls won't show up if you don't include it  gideon
but i want to load file    so i what i do give solution
can this be enabled for the flash player  does the pause event fire when the video pauses to buffer 
seems like perhaps that announcement was premature  as i cannot this dash demo to work in ff24  although it works in chrome canary  http   dash mse test appspot com dash player html url http   yt dash mse test commondatastorage googleapis com media car 20120827 manifest mpd
this here shows the play button on ie6 + ie7  asterix hides the rule from ie8+    this trick works also for the elements on the control bar 
thats true  if the caching logic was removed it seems it would help solve a lot of these state issues 
issue fixed   sorry its not due to videojs or grunt   i fixed this issue   previously we are not calling this _super   in init function of ember view  
oh sorry i thought i had closed this issue  it turned out that videojs was not the problem  i think it was a div on top of the poster that was rendered differently on firefox and ie

 heff   yes  i've also included the type for the new video but when the new video start playing the currenttime stays zero  i've found that after changing tech  flash always returns zero for currenttime  so the player starts acting weird 
i'm using  srt files  http   www opensubtitles org pt subtitles 5496813 csi miami cyber lebrity pt you can get the one i'm using here  the first sub is a special character one  
http   jsfiddle net zzxfb 5  the problem in jsfiddle occurs on ie 11 10 9 as well  when i have html set as the first techorder to go by  the video plays fine  until you try to open the lightbox  then video js stops the javascript and throws and error  but it's just "unspecified error"  are there any methods you see built into either colorbox or video js that can delay the player initializing until the lightbox is open  unfortunately  the way the backend is built the video elements are listed out onto the page  then video js does it's magic  not sure how to delay video js from converting the videos by default  even then  if i could delay the plugin from converting the video tags to flash objects until the lightbox is opened  when i open and then close the lightbox  won't i suffer from the same fate as i am now  i almost need to store those video tags in a javascript array  then rebuild the flash player from the video element everytime i open and close the lightbox  that way a new player is initialized on every open     seems like a clunky solution  though 
 gkatsev the fullscreen per se works  the problem is  the video is the same size as before and not zoomed to the fullscreen  http   sc cdn scaleengine net i 2e06806229d597f24276d8e7d57796bf png no errors were logged  i've tested it with firefox 30 0 and google chrome 35 0 1916 153 on windows 7

this issue appears to be related to video size  if the aspect ratio is not exact to the last possible pixel  this sort of issue occurs even on the newest videojs  when video is resized  since both 4 3 and 16 9 aspect ratios are not proper fractions  you run into rounding issues  videojs might benefit from some sort of memory buffer initialization if that is even possible in javascript  i am primarily a fortran c c++ programmer  so i look at lower levels primarily as far as code is concerned 
thank you for the update  just checked it now with 4 8 5  and it's not fixed  ie 10 error  object doesn't support property or method 'da' 
sure the error is mine  but i do not know where he is  for example  now part of the video but do not download enough data before starting  like a preloader  and stops  this is the link  https   www antoniovaccari it video buzz_1 html
sure  i can see the problem in this page  http   jsbin com lirerosehuze 1 edit this is based off of sandbox index html example  with the obvious differences to replicate my problem  namely   the primary video source is an hls stream  the video is different for non safari  v 7 1  browsers   autoplay "true"  on 'loadeddata'  the script calls this currenttime 30   the problem doesn't always occur on the first time loading the page  however  refreshing the page will break the seek as i described 
hi thanks for the response  please find the screen shot attached below of the request header    the red color of the video source request is just partial content 206  its not that it cannot find the video    let me know if you need any details     on fri  oct 24  2014 at 9 10 pm  matthew mcclure notifications github com wrote  ## thomas a  edison   "genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety nine per cent perspiration "

it works fine in firefox  i'm closing this until anybody else reports the same issue 
sorry for the delayed response  i was testing on work computers originally  but over christmas break i tested on my native windows machine  a virtual box on my linux machine and browserstack  where everything appeared to be working as expected  i come to work today and it's magically working on all of our machines    i swear i cleared my cache   closing this 
hi mmcc  after setting up a local isolated test case it turned out  that not video js itsself is responsible for the crash  but the "secure html5 video player" which utilizes video js  you can close the issue and i thank you for your help
well  that depends on what the client   my boss really  i think for now the solution will be to provide an alternative video in a separate link underneath the player  not the nicest solution though  i'll keep an eye on this repository to see what's going on with the audio descriptions and offer a helping hand brain when i can  would this be the thread to watch  or will there be some place else where communication will be taking place 
i'll do my best with a test case  so far  ie8  ie11 with techorder"   "flash"  latest video js    from github source file 
no problems   i'm already using my own minified version  thanks 
thank  in 4 8 4 version i must do it myself 
are my comments about drms and licensing related to video js  or is that on my part to make work 
yeah the corp laptop has the co version  i'm using v4 12 11
hey  heff  mostly  i'm importing plugin scss files with sass import function  you can see example code below   after that  i'm importing this file to my general scss file  for information  i just import one time  example code   only problem in this scenario is font files of videojs  if work on the different folders and when you send files to production you do compile or something  you cannot use the font files directly so maybe you can create another repo for that  with bower support   when i work with gulp or grunt  i always copy necessary files to production side with copy function of them 
i know this issue is popping up all over the web lately  it seems apple has done something recently to trigger this  it's obviously not critical  just somewhat silly for my users to see play buttons as random smiley faces  on mon  oct 19  2015 at 11 54 am  gary katsevman notifications github com wrote 
 visor  is a thin wrapper around videojs to initialize the player and all the plugins i've written for it  it looks like this 
i'm adding my components to the player itself  i'll see about building a reduced case once i've got permission from my client 
i used default browser of android 4 2
 gkatsev does that mean i should pull source and use that as opposed to cdn

i'm using the latest tagged version  i don't have much of a reduced test case  other than spamming the mute toggle really fast until it happens  my guess is that doing that the tech receives a "mute" signal when the player is being muted  thus messing it up  2016 01 26 17 45 gmt+01 00 gary katsevman notifications github com 
interesting  i'll try it 
no the file is a temporay file created in the temp directory using fileentry api  i got url to access this resource by "var url   url createobjecturl file  "  now i am feeding this url to the latest version of videojs  note that if i feed the url of a completed file object videojs can successfully play the whole track  but if i feed the url of a file object that is still being fetched  only portion of the file that has already been fetched is only being played  no matter if the rest of file is being fetched afterwards 
absolutely
sure  thanks 
here is the sample code to reproduce the issue  on firefox you will be able to see the video with the caption  you need to selected it   on chromium  the video plays well and the subtitle icon is shown  but if you were to select any language  the subtitles would not show  you can use the html code provided below 
i followed the quickstart recommendations  simply importing the css and js from fastly   based on your recommendation  i built videojs from source and can confirm that the big play button appears  thanks for the help and quick response  the quickstart was too easy not to try first

hi ben  even you don't have to use your cell and mobile data to reproduce it  it's enough to use chrome with developer tools and set throttling to any xg connection vs wifi to see the difference  i can't find any difference in dom  here are 2 captures reproducing the problem  http   oi66 tinypic com 2wgf8n6 jpg http   oi68 tinypic com apgzg6 jpg thanks a lot for answering

very thanks 😊
 gkatsev that's one way to do it  but i was wondering shouldn't it switch automatically to the next available source if the default one is not supported 
 gkatsev version 5 19 1  type 'video flv' browser  chrome 57 0 2987 133  64 bit  simple code 
thanks for your prompt reply  gkatsev   i m using the latest version of video js and having the code igniter framework in my application  i will go through the css file and will see to over come this problem 
i believe that would still violate wcag for ios  is there another approach that won't break accessibility 
i think i can close this since i suspect that it's very likely due to https   github com angular angular issues 14252
this was happening on first use  i think several of the functions could have better error handling  checking for valid values   i think some of the issues may be that in more modern libraries like angular  react and vue  you can "if" conditions that will then inject or remove the html portions based on conditions  which in that case  you can't call dispose    my work around in vue  which seemed to have fixed this for me  was instead of using   v if   i used   v show   which keeps the html intact  but toggles the visibility based on the condition

thank you for replying  i did not use  nativecontrolfortouch    if i dont set  overridenative   for some android devices  it displays the native control bar  i tried using  player src  overridenative  true     it seems to work  i will test more android devices  thanks again 
i can play the rtmp stream outside angular  it is playing well in vlc player  i don't think flash tech added  what should i do    mister ben
ok  i ignored that  and is ok  thanks
i'm really sorry to reply you so late  but i found that this kind of situation happens when the network speed is very slow  at this time  clicking the play button will not respond  and there will be no prompt
ok  either something got ran or i'm absolutely crazy  or both  previously  a search like http   readthedocs org search project  q django would only return two very random projects "by project " and django or celery wouldn't appear  seems seem to be up now  i also have a fix for the none   appearing on those pages  just a change made to the base search html template that didn't get carried over  it's in my readthedocs repo  i'll put in a pull request  next step is to unify the template so you can facet down on the same url  and then tying that into the sphinx search
we got quite a few images in there  e g  http   docs obspy org gallery html   i'll try to split up the api from the tutorial gallery and upload it again in two different sub documentations   maybe this is working

hmm  i think i misinterpreted the output to mean it was running  not installing  sphinx before installing the requirements  because context was my docs were failing to build due to missing deps  so i thought that was the issue   but then recently  i notice that my docs are now building  i think because i'd started  moving my requirements into setup py  https   github com kowey educe commit 14cd9b908b0603155ff0166f74d4f4ee06623912  after getting a better understanding of pip v setuptools  so i suspect it's all just python newbie confusion on my part and that closing this ticket should be fine  sorry for the noise 
 agjohnson i was setting up rtd server internally to talk to our gitlab server  it's a little complicated because our projects are open source  but we host them internally  yadda yadda yadda  i would also offer help with making this feature and testing it out

how much 
great   i checked this morning and everything seems to be back to normal  thank you so much for your great work on rtd   
yes  article type makes sense  i think "og description" will be the trickiest tag to get right   it along with "og title" contain the text which is actually shown in the onebox  according to  this  http   www joshspeters com how to optimize the ogdescription tag for search and social   most sites will display between 200 and 300 characters of the og description value  so it essentially is a 200 character summary of the doc page 
no real problem but i argue that it is semantically incorrect    my redirect rule is not temporary as the http status suggests but permanent  i restructured my documentation  which made the rule necessary in the first place  and i don't intend to ever revert that  should i need to change the structure again in some way a new  different rule would be required    because of the above user agents will for ever have to make two requests  it's unnecessary to delay the delivery of the documentation to the user and put extra load on your infrastructure

do you know all software components on which  tex source files  https   en wikipedia org wiki tex  might  depend on  https   ctan org pkg texdepend  for your documentation generation 
to my knowledge conda can only pull from conda repositories  it cannot install from source  if you want to install a python project from source you would typically do either  python setup py install  or  pip install    when in the package source directory  if the conda environment is already active  then using  pip  should put it into the same environment 
i managed to stumble through registration and adding myself to the project  wow their website could really benefit from a usability study   probably the biggest thing i'm unclear on is the workflow  i can get to the "start translating" page  but i'm not clear on where to go from there  especially when it comes to  expected  workflow  i'm almost positive i've figured out  some  way to translate things from there  but i don't know what the rtd preferred way is  another  more specific question would be  i found  for example  the missing "ago" translation  it looks like it's currently awaiting review  questions on workflow notwithstanding  is there a way to indicate noun case  i mean  presumably there isn't  unless they have way more nlp than i'm expecting   so what's the workaround  for example  the translation window looks like this    date s ago vor   date s but  unlike english  the "vor" preposition affects the case  and therefore noun endings  of the date itself  a case naive translation would render  gets added   i suppose it would be possible to just edit the date representation    if i could find it     but its seems like    there should be a better approach

here is an example of a link to a labeled section  https   docs readthedocs io en latest getting_started html#in rst the navigation tree is not highlight correctly  but the following link highlights 'in markdown' section as expected  https   docs readthedocs io en latest getting_started html#in markdown these two urls are the results of navigation  by clicking the two links in 'write your docs' section https   docs readthedocs io en latest getting_started html#write your docs notice that 'in markdown' label and title are approximately the same  and in rst and 'in restructuredtext' aren't very close  maybe a sphinx doc issue but rtd is the only theme i know that highlights navigation tree  so the mistake might be more obvious here

i tried building it locally  using python 3 7  with no luck same issue  i can try building it with a python version prior to 3 7 if it can help 
i need pytorch to build the package itself  and without that  the autodoc functionality doesn't work  the documentation that i currently have is generated by not having anything in my doc requirements txt  this generates everything except for the detailed api reference automodule stuff because it can't import the package itself  if there's a way to get automodule to work without this issue  then i wouldn't need these build requirements 
i do not  here is the full request    headers  
first  a disclaimer  take everything i say with a grain of salt  because i didn't really know anything about any of it until last night  after looking at this more closely  i don't think this feature request really makes sense  the advantage of  flit  is that it uses  pyproject toml  instead of  setup py   so it's easier to work with  has less boiler plate  and is more modern   pip  can also use  pyproject toml   see  pep 518  https   www python org dev peps pep 0518    though  in fact  my  pyproject toml  instructs  pip  to first install  flit   and then to use  flit  to install my package  really  the whole idea behind  pyproject toml  is for services like rtd to just use  pip  and nothing else  the practical exception is for  pip install   editable   which still requires  setup py  and cannot use  pyproject toml   there's a long thread on this topic  here  https   discuss python org t pip 19 1 and installing in editable mode with pyproject toml 1553   last night my docs weren't building  and i thought that was because rtd was trying to do  pip install   editable   today i looked more closely at the logs and saw that rtd was actually calling  python setup py install  directly  which obviously won't work if there isn't a  setup py   this surprised me because i had read that  the default was to use  pip   https   docs readthedocs io en stable config file v2 html#packages   but at the time i didn't have a   readthedocs yml  config file  so this morning i added one specifying that rtd should use  pip   and then my project was able to build  so in the end  the only thing i'm confused about is why rtd wasn't installing my project with pip by default  does there need to be a   readthedocs yml  file  possibly empty  for the defaults described in the  documentation  https   docs readthedocs io en stable config file v2 html  to take effect  if so  is that ever explicitly stated anywhere  anyways  thanks for taking the time to respond to this issue

good question  when i asked in irc what types we needed  i think sav where the saves you did via the hud bar  if they aren't needed then thats cool 
it's a single 7z archive with 34   bin  files  pretty much all my goodmerged sets are packed the same way 
 mrvacbob it tells me the build failed  so i don't think so 
 nds i have been able to add them before  it just stopped working for that file type at some point  don't know when and don't know why  should i replace the core 
thanks pggb 
no luck  i still get the same issue  which part of the crash log is most helpful  i tried pasting the entire log but it is too long 
ok  intel core i5  intel hd 4000  4gb of ram and 500gb of hdd  due  the point is my snes9x standalone version doesn't present this issue  and visual boy advance hider  i remember in snes9x setting menu is an option to fix this issue turing off "frame skip" or puting it on "0" 
yes  i got it to work  ok  it didn't show up under the menubar  but i went to bluetooth control panel  pressed the red button and it showed up there  then i pressed pair in in the control panel  then the red button again on the controller  and it paired it  somehow i had done this before  but never hit the red button a second time  once to activate bluetooth  and a second time after hitting pair 
it does it for all systems that i add rome to  is there a way to get the hash name 
the version that i have is the eu version in spanish and italian  but the one in french is also doing the same  most of my gba games just won't even run  black screen   the only ones that run are the ones for which the app find the box cover  the majority of the other rom files won't run  they have gab extension  not zipped   i am trying to make a brand new library file  copying the file inside the library  so it won't run from the usb disk  which btw is a hd  not a flash stick  
no  this is a mistake in your preferences  this is only for the roms and not the whole game library  i will not add issues for fun 
castlevania simphony of the night  should i try with another game 
as someone who's some time hunting their own bugs  i know the value of a comprehensive report  yes  i can confirm this resolves this issue  thanks for the quick reply  might i ask when this is likely to be worked into the wip release

it happens with every single game  waiamu gba  all atari 2600 roms  homebrew  etc  etc    i'm running under osx el capitan 10 11 3  latest beta  imac retina 27  using openemu v2 0 1  407 g415a4a6 release   every single close action i try  exit from menu  top left red button  exit from dock  results in nothing  the game keeps running and i can still play  the only way to quit openemu is force quit with activity monitor please tell me if i can give you any more hints  thanks
here is a quick timeline of events to give you a good idea of what happened  i have an openemu instance with every nes  snes  n64  sega genesis  and gba game  thousands of games right  i created a custom collection for the games i frequent out of all of those  i set up the controller for each console type  1  i plugged in my controller and opened openemu to play a game  2  i immediately got a notification that there is a newer version of the game  i opted to update it  3  when i got back into openemu  all the games  controller settings  and collection i added were gone  this is why i wanted to back up these settings  i imagine these are just files that got sent to the trash bin when i updated right  the bug here is that games and settings are not persistent through the update process     john galbraith information security analyst cell  727    recipient not in address book    blog  https   tech55i com from  clobber notifications github com reply  openemu openemu reply reply github com date  july 24  2016 at 6 15 55 pm to  openemu openemu openemu noreply github com cc  galbraith john jagalbraith icloud com  author author noreply github com subject  re   openemu openemu  backup   restore games and saves   feature request  #2668  what the hell are you talking about  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread

hi clobber  this issue is for roms that i already have downloaded  i am trying to drag and drop from my old openemu roms folder to the new openemu build  i did a test download of some nes roms and they loaded just fine  i'm not sure what the issue but for now i have a workaround 
first of all  i want to say thank you for providing such an amazing  95  pain free emulator  i've been into emulation for 20 years  mame  stella  kega fusion and all the rest  but i have never experienced anything easier  it's kind of a miracle imo  so re  this  i attempted it two ways  1  first  i placed the exec bin and grom bin bios files into the drag drop screen  they showed up as their own "game like" boxes with the "off the air tv" striping  go to click a game  i e   baseball and get the same error message that i need the exec bin and from bin files  tried other games like snafu  same thing happens  the game "boxes" appear for the games  complete with auto downloaded box art  but i get the error message when i click it to run  2  then i went and dowloaded a diff set of bin files online  exec and grom   drag dropped those  prompted to fix "issues"  checked off the two boxes and selected "intellivision" in the dropdown  clicked "apply " game gives me the same error message

in finder  dragged them to the trash  then put them all back  restarted but didnt work
no 
before i start i did try and quit and reopen openemu but it disappeared so i closed it reopened it and now its back to noraml
if i delete a game from my library and then try to re add it again  it will not copy into my library  it happens with all games i try to add 
 clobber well  on my end  the game most effective to hear the bug is shining force's city theme  it has a strange "echo" that you can hear with a high enough volume  listen to the city theme from original hardware here  https   www youtube com watch v 4rc2_6uwohe  then compare it to what the emulator  openemu  is playing  otherwise  it affects all the games i tried  like the sonic games and space harrier ii  the latter which doesn't sound right 
this one works as well  in fact  if i remember right  in the interval  i switch from the experimental to the stable version i dig this morning  i had 4 roms sega master system  all of them no longer works  i remove two of them and download it again  the new one works  attached one which no longer works  it seems not being dragable on openemu while  i copy it from   users jbd library application  support openemu game  library roms sega  master  system   alex kidd in miracle world  usa  europe   v1 1  zip  https   github com openemu openemu files 2430440 alex kidd in miracle world usa europe v1 1 zip  do you think possible the file to have been modified by openemu any way  i did not have any problem with other consoles 
here's the code   ggplot null  aes x   1  y   1  label   '≤ foo bar'   + geom_label    the missing character will be there whether you save the pdf from the rstudio dialog or with  ggsave   
try the following steps  1  start profiling 2  source the following script with the for loop line copy pasted for 300 times  3  end profiling 4  a very large rprofvis is produced  5  rstudio server should hang for a long time  6  if rstudio server is able to show it  save the rprofvis file and reopen it  7  copy paste as many lines of the  for loop  so that the profiling get large enough to cause the web browser hang  8   rstudio server kill all  does not solve the problem  removing     rstudio sessions active    does not either  removing the saved   rprofvis  file does not help  completely removing     rstudio  solves the problem but everything in config is lost 
i doubt that i hit  f2   almost nothing in the environment  the code  that i had just selected for copy paste  
from what i can tell  if you've installed once  subsequent installations will work without the warning  so i need to set up a fresh installation  i'll update when that's ready 
ah—it works when it's set  same with the same project level attribute  so  closing 
oops  i meant firefox  thanks  i edited the original message  i like to include at least one mistake in every issue i file  it's a regression—everything's fine in rstudio server 1 2 5033  though it's on ubuntu 18 04 3  i can switch red hat to 1 2  or ubuntu to 1 3  if you think the os could be a factor 
sorry for being so unclear  rstudio just seems to get stuck after the creation of the  md file  here's what it looks like    capture  https   user images githubusercontent com 22040238 49180868 c3807b80 f30a 11e8 8818 57419c6f6e13 png  it will sit like this for hours  until i hit the stop button  with version 1 1 463  the time elapsed from the creation of the  md document to the html document is maybe a second 
must admit that i am slightly confused  it worked nicely on my home computer  both in rstudio and on the command line  the same environments  but ubuntu 16 04 vs  17 04   pulled from github  goranbrostrom eha   the same  rbulidignore  etc 
nope  here's a recording    shiny deploy 2018 12 05 11_30_22  https   user images githubusercontent com 86978 49532015 3ba5ee80 f881 11e8 8112 ed4850a6c9e3 gif  this seems to happen only for the first deployment of the app  if i redeploy  then everything happens quickly 
i believe the results were exported in https   github com ropensci drake issues 807   gadenbuie  is this true  until i can access the local version of the job launcher  i cannot test this out myself   i am having trouble compiling the ide preview of 1 2 1335 because the ubuntu 18 tarball appears to not have a  cmakelists txt  file

i haven't tried a daily build yet  i did go back to use 0 9x and an earlier version of 1 thinking it was related to something with a new release  those still crashed  i updated to the latest full release today without luck 
 ronblum are you using os x  the viewer pane is empty  so i don't know what you mean with that  to make sure that we're talking about the same thing  an online version of the app can be accessed at   http   pieter vermeesch es ucl ac uk shiny isoplotrshiny r   http   pieter vermeesch es ucl ac uk shiny isoplotrshiny r   copying and pasting from to the left hand panel works fine in a web browser  but not when the app is run offline in an rstudio window  again  the problem only occurs in os x  several users have informed me of this problem  and i've verified it myself 
not really  imagine now that you only need to do it for some lines  it's easy when doing it for all or based on some condition that can be reduced to regex  with sublime at least   but not when doing it for some selected ones  nevertheless  guess this will be solved with rstudio 1 3

 jmcphers well  because it makes sense  at least to me  to clean everything when i restart a session  why would the plot pane be cleaned and not the viewer pane 
 jmcphers there was no problem running  r  from the terminal  but it didn't work in rstudio  thankfully  gregleleu's solution worked 
no  the installation is not on a vm  one weird thing i noticed is that rstudio is running well on a different user account on my computer 
i tried 1 2 660  the problem is gone  thanks a lot 
just upgraded to latest 1 1 453 and bug persists  perhaps more detailed instructions for recreating  1  start rstudio 2  open new r script source file 3  enter a line of code  i just spammed the "a" key  until line width exceeds source window width 4  move cursor to beginning of line 5  use comment uncomment shortcut and the editor will unexpectedly scroll horizontally by 2 spaces this may seem insignificant  however when there are several levels of indentation  commenting uncommenting the nested code becomes very annoying  as an example  i have attached a  bugdemo r zip  https   github com rstudio rstudio files 2060155 bugdemo r zip   if you move your cursor down to the print line and repeatedly comment uncomment the line using the shortcut  the editor will scroll horizontally back and forth and partially hide code on lower levels of indentation  i usually avoid writing lines of code that are too long to fit in the editor screen  but sometimes when i edit other peoples' source code  like i was doing earlier today  i come across lots of code that exceeds my screen width  and that's where this becomes a problem  please let me know if you still cannot reproduce the issue or have any other comments  thank you

interestingly  i no longer see this problem now  the difference between now and earlier when i found the problem is    after the upgrade to preview version  loading my current project will try to load a package then the console is like this   i also witnessed the problem with the dragging tabs at that time  i cleaned my rstudio desktop folder and the package loading problem no longer appear  so i didn't report issue for that  it seemed that cleaning the desktop folder also solved the problem above 
 jjallaire  kevinushey i rolled back  but will be happy to load it again and run a diagnostics report  i tested on two machines in the local environment  neither of them completely clean 18 04 installs  both with somewhat older r  3 4 4   there is no local proxy here  so networking should not be the cause 
can't repro after a reboot  also had trouble rebooting based on whether or not scrollbars were showing  i think you're safe to close this one unless anybody else encounters it  we can blame gotomeeting and or my laptop being overdue for a nap

my  reticulate  version was 1 10  i have installed the development version and now works normally  thanks 
i'm using a surface pro 4  hybrid laptop tablet   i have tried with just the trackpad in the removable keyboard  with the touch screen and with an external mouse  same behavior with all of them  also i have two input methods configured for spanish and english
i am using the "modern" desktop theme  the behavior is the same when i use the out of the box "breeze dark" theme  currently  rstudio is the only application that has this problem  everywhere else the dark theme is working correctly with the menu text  etc 
thanks for the suggestion  i didn't know about the preview release  unfortunately after installation i can't seem to open preview release at all  using x2go the preview results in
the solution you presented  gtritchie worked perfectly   thanks so much 
unfortunately  it is now happening more sporadically  i'll reopen the issue when i can figure out the reproducible steps 
rgui is on windows  the same platform as rstudio 1 2 5036  rstudio 1 2 5033 is on ubuntu
i only noticed it after updating from 1 1 456 to 1 2 1335

hi  no   i'm not using packrat  yes   listinstalledpackages reproduces the error and i've produced a traceback  i've done this from my imac  which shows exactly the same issue  rather than the macbook pro so if there is a slight discrepancy between the first report and the second that will be why   traceback txt  https   github com rstudio rstudio files 2466207 traceback txt 
1 2 1206 exhibited this although i subsequently downloaded the latest version from the rstudio preview website and this also did this too  don't have the exact version to hand but the one from the website yesterday  
you are correct  the links are corrected in the preview release  closing  thank you 
 ronblum thanks for your response  unfortunately the issue persists with version 1 2 1286  2019 02 15   i am also using r version 3 5 2  2018 12 20   i did notice something odd  though  and i think this might be the cause of the issue  when i open up the git bash    not in rstudio    and type  which git   i get the output   mingw64 bin git   i have the same output from within rstudio's terminal running git bash   in git bash  when i type  echo  path   tr ' ' ' n'  i can see   c program files git bin    however  when in rstudio's terminal  i cannot see this  pretty much everything else is the same  do you think this is the issue  and is there a reason rstudio's git bash would show a different result than the standalone git bash 
doesn't happen on ubuntu 18 04 either  looks to be a windows specific issue

understandable but then it make sense to have it with grey background  writable text box could be useful in case when having a directory path in clipboard to paste it into that box  that would be even more useful when having a long path of multiple nested directories  now i have to click "browse"  then hit "ctrl+l"  and then i can paste the path 
well problem is that it crashes the r session in rstudio before i can ask for a traceback     so it just gives me a window "r session aborted"    but the problem should be easy enough for you to reproduce   
yes this is fixed in  1 3 929  for me  perhaps the binary download paths i mention on the rstudio site were not updated with the pr patch 
hi  i've seen this  i can debug and fix myself if needed as it is quite blocking to have the editor crash often  but it looked like an independant issue that you might know in internal  i'll try  but i don't think the configuration has been changed  unfortunately  there is no version on archlinux  but it was up to date on the date of the creation of the issue  local files  thanks  i'll try this too  unfortunately i cannot  there is no coredump reported for the rstudio process  only for the rsession

here is what i do in my controller  i'm using angularjs 1 3 0b7    with this i get sometimes 1 or 2 attachments saved and then the 412 error for the others  then this error appears each time i open my app  the only way to get rid of this error is to delete the 'not sync'ed' files from pouchdb as you said  it is quite tricky to add remove multiple attachments and would be great to have that implemented in the api  thanks for the great work you've done so far 
well    trying to get the max date  should i do this in memory 
filter pouch is great  but unless i am mistaken  you still cannot do partial updates with this plugin  i started analyzing the  _bulk_docs  calls make by the replication routines and as a proof of concept  modified  api _bulkdocs  in pouchdb js so that it removes the attribute from  req  that would not be updated  the problem is that the couchdb  _bulk_docs  api doesn't seem to support partial updates so removing the attribute then wipes out the attribute in couch  in quickly reviewing http   wiki apache org couchdb http_bulk_document_api it doesn't appear that there is support for partial updates  i think i could create a pouch plugin that uses update handlers instead of the  _bulk_docs  mechanism to sync  but this defeats the whole point of sending all the changes using  _bulk_docs   which i find pretty necessary from an efficiency standpoint  do you have any other ideas  in your experience  how do people normally handle collaboration on the same document using couch  am i looking at this from the wrong angle

we encountered this in the following scenario    integration tests automatically create and delete databases  after tests are done  and test a feature that uploads an attachment   error in the integration test leads to deletion of the databases before the final callback is called    because of the misleading error message it took way longer than necessary to find the problem
sorry for being unclear  nolanlawson   this is running in a cordova app  the useragent within the app is  "mozilla 5 0  linux  android 6 0 1  nexus 5 build mob30m  wv  applewebkit 537 36  khtml  like gecko  version 4 0 chrome 51 0 2704 81 mobile safari 537 36"   the error message itself  caught by  window onerror   is   error in success callbackid  sqliteplugin1486841933   typeerror  cannot read property 'length' of null   the plugin itself is  cordova plugin sqlite 2 1 0 4 "sqliteplugin"   the app formerly used  cordova sqlite storage  and worked fine  i only use the plugin to get around durable storage limits   but i migrated over to the new plugin for better perf  since it was a migration i never changed the pouchdb instantiation code   new pouchdb name   adapter  'websql'  auto_compaction  true  location  'default'     the database is large   1800 docs  and the error arises at the end of a  promise all  that handles a large number of reads from pouchdb  i will see if i can create a minimal test case  but i do not know if it will be easy to do 
i am using ie11  other's here have no problem  there seems to be some setting or maybe indexdb is not there  as far as i know  i don't have it running in ie9 mode  i looked up private browsing mode and that seems to be for the life of the browser and i can make this happen over and over

 willholley thank you     that was the issue  i was doing something like   the variables came in as strings rather than the needed arrays  thank you   
 efratyo we're running  0 50 3   i did have to do a lot of hacking to get the memory adapter working  although i don't remember the precise steps  in the end we had to abandon pouchdb altogether  the performance we were seeing was so atrocious web requests were faster  we're using request graphql  noramlizr  redux  and redux persist now to store our data offline  it's not as elegant for updates and sync  but it performs as you'd expect from disk on the device  good luck

also note that the latest revision of the swf fileformat allows for a new  incompatible  compression  the parser should either continue to reject such files or be corrected to allow for both compression types 
that is one perspective  but it fails to account for the normal perspective for the implication  that is one tag that implies multiple others  i want a solution that allows the same implication to work in both directions  as for an example  there is the main_six tag over on bronibooru com

i actually don't get an error    everything goes well  but the object is never updated  i patched the update_resource action to do this to fix the problem  controller do def update_resource object  attributes  object attributes   params object class to_s underscore   end perhaps it could be fixed upstream too by passing the correct attributes into the function  are you able to repro this on your end  on may 25  2011  at 7 56 pm  gregbell wrote

hi i closed this  as i'm pretty sure this is not a bug and more of a support issue  i also suspect it should be added to an faq somewhere  plugins are loaded well after this gem  and that means that when activeadmin tries to load it fails to get an active record object  i resolved this by turning the plugin into a gem and then using it like any other gem  works like a dream  be aware  the sybase active record adapter does not support the methods required to do the rake db migrate  so you'll need to create the admin_users tables manually 
i indeed had 1 8 7 ruby  p 0  running  that must be it  i upgraded to 1 9 2 and this error is gone  some others appeared but had nothing to do with active admin  so far  thanks  keep up the good work

i think so    
ok  figured it out  it turns out that the culprit was having an old version of pry rails in the gemfile  i realized this when i started an app from scratch again and found that everything worked  it would also explain what i saw when debugging  since i was doing it through pry  i tried to match my state between the new app and my existing app and eventually got a repro when i added pry rails to the gemfile  so i guess it's because pry had a rails 3 2 incompatibility or something in the older version  but it seems to have been fixed with the latest version  0 1 6   basically  just do "bundle update pry rails" if you were having this problem too 
i was using master branch at the time i submitted the issue 
i don't even know how to test that 
that made it work   yeah things act up strange when i start to name my model "page"  alas  i needed to show something to my employer today so i had to come up with something that is workign and i renamed everything to staticpage instead hah  i guess i'll just revert to an earlier commit now that this seem to do the trick  on feb 1  2012  at 8 18 pm  philippe creux wrote

thank you for this information  indeed i didn't know reorder     thanks a lot  i've successfully sort my index page with a reorder because a simple order doesn't works  but after this it's became impossible to sort like before by clicking on the column name that we want to sort  s  any idea to keep a default sort and a custom sort for the user  
if i comment the line   on the view page for the resource it will be titled "resource #x" where x is the value of the id of the item  this is in an h2 tag with a id of page_title  if i'm using inherited resources this will also be the title displayed in the breakcrumb link  i feel like this is inconsistent behavior because this display_name value is used everywhere else a title is called for in activeadmin  clearly it's not a hard work around but for a relative n00b like myself it did take some time to figure this out 
no haven't been able to get anything working yet and neither have i had any more response on this 
hi  jpmckinney   your controller path is wrong  need "app admin dashboard rb"    "admin dashboard rb"   this is my reason too

i have a default scope condition in the model but when i add comment through active admin for the deactivated user it throws " route_instance_path" for nil because it looks for the resource in the database without overriding the default scope hence its returning nil   
 daxter thanks for the comment  let me clarify your questions  i don't have a  template  model and the previous behaviour was not desired  the version i use is the official gem release 
the expected behaviour of inherited resources is that it would override a redirect if passed in a block  https   github com josevalim inherited_resources#overwriting actions  i'm not quite sure of how this could be fixed    maybe an if block  on the format line  this situation should be common to all resources constructed in this manner 
it was above an existing devise_for call which caused an error

well  i wanted to turn off menu item for a given resource  with a  menu false  resource controller's option  because it doesn't make sense to give access to this resource from a top level menu  in my case this particular resource may be displayed standalone but should be always displayed within a context of another resource  its master   when i just used  menu false  and redirected to this controller path i got the  nomenuerror  exception  but i just wanted to keep default menu  so the money patch above does the job  i may turn off a menu item for a given resource and keep the default menu displayed

no  i figured out that if i added 'scoped_collection'  i must override the default actions in controller  like  create' ' update' as scoped_collection override all the controller action   so i override'd them  it worked  but i created some redundant actions  cry  thing is  i must include scoped_collection too  as it behave exactly as i wanted   no  if i didn't used scoped_collection from the beginning  no errors occurs

yes  like the pages selection where you can select multiple usergroups
ah yes  an important detail  i was adding the user through the pyro control panel 
no  i don't think so  categories provide a method of clearly separating articles by subject matter  tags are more loose in the sense articles can have many tags  listing the subjects covered within an article  let's say we have an seo blog  we might choose to tag all articles with organisations mentioned within them  "google" might be a tag that appears within an article about organic seo  category   "organic seo"   but we might also have "google" tagged on an article about google analytics  category   "analytics"   if we used tags in the way you suggest  we'd lose the real benefit of tags  also  by using the same gui as navigation and pages  it will make it very easy to have this multi level approach

sorry about the delay  at the end of the process  when you delete the custom field  the stream field is not deleted in db  it becomes null and you cannot pick it at admin panel  it must be restored with the db manager  despite i think that i have read something about what i'm going to say  i would like to add another issue with fields and namespaces  we cannot create more than one field with the same name in different page types because they have the same namespace  i suppose that namespaces should not be the same or we need the field assignment tool from streams module

not sure what you mean by back end software but the disk has an s3 source which may be a factor 
pulled 2 3 develop again  still getting the same error  also tried a fresh clone of the branch  as well as downloading a zip

i don't think so  because i can see the params in the logfile  the querystring and the parameter hash are equal  the only difference that i can see are the sql statements that are shown with log_level    debug   and other timing values 
nope  there are no updates when loading the page in production mode 
migrations are suposed to not be rewrited  if rewrited the up to be inert and print a warning  then there will be a diference across machines  in some of them it has run with content and others have run without   so  in some of them the down method will work and the other will not  then the difference have to be corrected manualy  migrations are suposed to ease the handling of problems  like diferences across machines   the down method is missused in the current working of migrations  because they are only used in development machines when not commited on git  this feature will enhance migrations usefullness for helping in this complex edge cases  also will ease rolling back migrations commited  witch is a more common situation   and will not add any hassle in not problems environment  may be  because i'm a beginer with rails bad migrations result in a problem  and i should learn the 'correct way'  i should   but i think i'm not the only beginer and this will make simplier to start with rails  commited bad migrations are a common beginer problem  
fixed  thanks josé 
no  i haven't 
got it  repeated calls are faster using read+write because there is an in memory cache for the read operation but not for the fetch multi operation  i'm going to try to implement the in memory cache for this to have the same benefits and open a pr

thanks gmile  i thought pull requests are not viewed in issues  so my mistake  i've created pull request with this commit so i'm closing this issue 
here is my test app with log and all included  https   github com edison rails test helper error
my mistake  sorry
 duffyjp don't think so  sprockets is at 3 7 after rails 5 upgrade so still uses  assets rb  to declare all the assets we actually want compiled

so the response header is set correctly  the body content encoding should be relevant  i suppose  how otherwise can you render non ascii symbols when the string itself is always ascii 
since the  count  in this context is used to determine whether the rows exist or not   include   doesn't need count btw  the following can be executed   select count 1  from "blogs"   or  count      this doesn't need any select values whatsoever except when  distinct  is used  could you please explain why all of the select values are being put into the  count  anyway  i see your point re too magical  but i don't agree with it  rails used to delegate  include   and others to array so it was simply fetching the records  now rails decided not to do this anymore and execute proper sql query to return the result of  include    and friends   but since those methods require the use of aggregate functions it is not just as simple as wrapping it in a  count   if rails has decided to go that route it needs to take into account the semantics  otherwise it is just being a string builder for sql  there are a few scenarios for using  count   1   count column_name     number of non null values from  column_name   2   count distinct column_name     number of distinct values on  column_name   3   count      or  count 1      number of records  the intention of using  count  in this particular example is to return the number of records  scenario 3   but rails uses  count  with incorrect semantics   what appears to be the scenario 1  to return number of non null values on a particular column   i understand that it is easier to just close the issue  but if rails has decided to support the translation of aggregate methods  such as  #include    it should apply correct semantics to it or otherwise do not support it  and users will make no assumptions about it   i respect your decision on closing the issue  but i hope you see my point  could you please reconsider it and discuss this internally 
this "show case" works fine with 3 0 x i have this problem after i upgrade one of my project
bundler says  using sprockets  2 8 1    i hope that's the information you seek  and yes  i used 3 2 8 prior to 3 2 9 rc2 
thank you for you efforts just figured out that it has been resolves in the new rc4
sure  i have  in the application js  since dom tree was changed by jquery ui  that's why i've got requests for image assets  i didn't think i have to mention that 
yes  works on a clean example app     must be some gems interfering  will update shortly
i can give it a try
well   the path to my actual use case is long  d i'll try and keep it to the relevant steps    1  an activerecord model has a field of home_city and away_city 2  i then use i18n to get a translation on " home_city  at  away_city "  this returns a safebuffer 3  then i call  titlecase on the returned object  because in some situations cities aren't capitalized in the model  4  this last call is in view and throws an exception

no  edit_node_path doesn't require an argument  let me see if i can make the problem clearer    imagine i have two resources  tree and node  in the show view for tree  i render a collection of nodes using   shared _node html erb   which looks something like this   each of these  including edit  takes me to the correct page for the node being rendered by the partial  so far  so good  now imagine i call the show action for node a  the show action for a node also renders a collection of node partials using the same view  nodes d and e are children of node a  so from a's show page i can see nodes d and e  each with the same three links as i saw for a  the show and delete links for d and e are correct  but clicking the edit links for either d or e will take me to the edit action for a  since edit_node_path by default works correctly for node a  but not d and e   i believe that  when not given arguments  edit_node_path will first try to link to the resource referenced by the variable   node   if   node  is nil  edit_node_path will then try to link to the resource referenced by the variable  node   as far as i can tell  edit_node_path will only require an argument if neither variable exists  my concern is that this behavior is inconsistent  if the show and destroy links within the partial for a resource call the show and destroy actions for the partial's resource  why should the edit link be any different 
well  i suppose either the link tag should be output or rails should explicitly indicate that it doesn't support such a thing in mailers  as it is it seems like an oversight  inlining the css could be handy too  perhaps  i'm don't have so much experience with creating html emails  so i can't say for sure 
will i be sure that nothing from application css scss is included in pages css scss and vice versa that way 
i'm willing to take it  on a deadline at the moment  but i should have time to revisit in a week or so 
 rafaelfranca i think that would be fine  other solutions i've thought of would be blacklist  app javascript      or ensure there is at least one    rb  in the directory 
 gchan  foo bar  is not  nil  after the save   foo bar baz  is  nil  
apologies if its a noob question    i tried moving aside the tmp directory  but it still fails in chrome  works elsewhere  perhaps i should upgrade rake

i'm using the fedora 15 32 bit  tomorrow will show the app with problem replicated 
i think rails must be available for commands like generate destroy etc with or without test directory  edit  i prefer rspec instead of test units  this is why i create my plugins with  t flag
sure  what's the best way to supply a sample application   and how can rails do nothing with the  load_path  eventually it adds  app    dirs to it  does it not  
can you use this https   github com rails rails pull 3125  
it's the same sql in both cases  in fact i changed it so the fast query is the_slow_one to_sql  which is then executed via activerecord      select_rows    in the slow case i guess it creates objects for each row and that's why is 10x slower  is that expected behavior 
the first problem i encountered was with the active_record transaction method  in both rails 3 0 and 3 1 this form of the call no longer works   what is strange  is that in other controllers i'm using the first form successfully but it fails in one particular controller  the name of the table model is heist  which i can't imaging being a reserved word  ah ha  i see the problem  i have a model name with the same name as the application and that is causing active_record methods to not be available on the base model name  i'll change the name of my app and that will fix the problem  but it does seem strange that such a namespace collision can exist 
 carlosantoniodasilva thank you for the clear explanation  i understand the original issue happens just with ruby 1 8 7 but the next rails  probably 4  will not support ruby 1 8 7  this fix is not required  i'm going to open a pull request for 3 2 branch 
true  but isn't it sort of the same thing  the same type of configuration  just sitting in a different place  a new application  after deploying  i discovered that hsts was by default telling my users to require https for all subdomains  which i didn't want  i quickly found the setting and put it into my environment file  but nothing i did had any effect  on a whim someone on the team searched our codebase for "hsts" and found the framework default  which had been overwriting my environment file 
 rafaelfranca i’ll notify my students of this issue because they are all experiencing it at this time  thus  i have them to hold off on using  rails c  and related commands until the issue is resolved  thanks for the feedback to this issue 
opened a pr on globalid here  https   github com rails globalid pull 109
yeah  that works  except one case   the  nomethoderror  would be triggered on  "arbitrary_object" even    and  nomethoderror#name  would be   even    which would lead to the same erroneous behavior 
the whole point about this  group  assets  is that i don't require asset gems in production environment  in fact  it would be even better if they even not existed in load path  when they are not required by bundler  requiring these gems is just the same as not putting them into this group and doesn't look like a solution 
ok  will do 
the problem is that when i copy paste the weird character  it changes from square symbol ꠸ and becomes �  �  so i'll have to either find a way to enter this character with a special keyboard combination  some kind of alt + some key  or its ascii code 
i made some more test  if i remove this gem "https   github com flyerhzm switch_user" rails s at least does not brakes on start up  any suggestion on what do i have to look into the code to patch it 
this is weird  i do not know where my application can cause this issue  i will try to debug 
while i agree that https   github com rails rails issues 6810#issuecomment 6483000 is more of a feature than a bug  this  on the other hand  sounds more like a bug to me than an actual feature 
i don't now  but if there is a problem with security the first option is better  but there is any problem with silence the warning 
as told in the linked post   
here is the full trace  thanks 
i believe render body plain etc is only available at 4 1  right 
please tell me you're not serious  first of all  this behaviour is mentioned nowhere   maybe there should be a hint of this being "intended" in  oh  the official documents  i mean  just look at http   guides rubyonrails org testing html#unit testing your models there's no mention of a line like  assertion at c  ruby192 lib ruby gems 1 9 1 gems activesupport 3 1 3 lib active_support testing setup_and_teardown rb 35 in 'block in run'  after this   that's what it's supposed to look like  according to the docs  there's also no mention of rake exploding after that  secondly  i'm pretty sure that there is some way to stop execution of a chain of commands in a proper manner   instead of letting it simply look like your application just exploded  thirdly  it seems as if the rubymine ide does not look stuff exploding in this way either   since that way i only get a list of whatever broke first  and not all the errors  i don't like this piecemeal approach  to be honest  fourthly  when i was using rails 2  i also don't remember exploding unit tests 
3 1 but confirmed in 3 0  untested in 2 x 
i tested it against master with postgresql 9 2 0  pg 0 14 1  i think the problem is not rails specific but comes from the difference between the date function in mysql and pgsql because this  works fine in pgsql 
it looks like it's no longer an issue in 3 2 as it appears the default "order by" is gone  ruby 1 9 2 p180  015   user select 'id'  to_sql    "select id from  "users " " and #except is working ruby 1 9 2 p180  020   user select 'id'  order 'version' 'id'  except  order  to_sql    "select id from  "users " " thanks
i've tried to reproduce this error in a new application   without success  but i've managed to find a way to repeat it in the original app  if that's any help to you  the problem appears when there's an exception thrown in another controller   the execution chain is broken    could be anything  like   after that  publisher  basecontroller seems to be invisible to rails  undefined method current_publisher   if i make a change to any controller file  can be as simple as adding a space   saving the file   rails reloads the code and the error disappears  now i'm not sure whether it's a problem with rails or with one of the gems we're using  just can't track down this sucker  i'll keep on trying with a sample app anyway  just thought i'd post an update first 
i've posted an app with  tests  https   github com wtn db_config_injection_app blob master test db_setup_test rb  that demonstrate the behavior  if you can please reopen this issue  i would appreciate it  to clarify  running a rake database task for a rails app from the command line results in the database config file being read at three points  1  rake calls  activerecord  tasks  databasetasks setup_initial_database_yaml   here  https   github com rails rails blob 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6 activerecord lib active_record railties databases rake#l5  2  activerecord configures its databases  here  https   github com rails rails blob 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6 activerecord lib active_record railtie rb#l210  3  rake re configures activerecord  here  https   github com rails rails blob 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6 activerecord lib active_record railtie rb#l41  →  here  https   github com rails rails blob 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6 activerecord lib active_record railties databases rake#l19  my issue is with point 3  rake does not need to force a change when activerecord is already configured  and reinitializing is the less expected choice  under rails  the rake tasks work as long as activerecord is configured  point 2   i acknowledge that my approach looks unconventional at first  but is simple and works with the current public api  i hope that you will give some consideration to customized  but valid  database configurations as the api evolves  thanks for your work on multiple databases support  and i appreciate your continuing leadership regarding this interface 
i'll see if i can come up with something if you're still not convinced  but take a look at  https   github com rails rails blob master activerecord lib active_record connection_adapters abstract query_cache rb#l71 you'll see that the object that makes its way into the queries collection for exec_explain is created on that line  never is the  bind key filled in  the bug is either here not including  binds or the explain stuff not checking for nil  i'd guess this is because the cache only stories post binded queries  so there are never any binds  you'll find that the queries logged by  https   github com rails rails blob master activerecord lib active_record connection_adapters abstract_adapter rb#l274 do in fact fill in    when there are no binds  which is why this doesn't barf on all queries  alternatively  i don't fully understand how the querycache works  but if the query is cached  why is the explainer ever even coming into play

hi  i can't reproduce this even by re running the same code  where this error happened before   but  regarding to the place where the error happen   in other words the error happen when callings to_sql arel  nil   i don't know this place in rails well  but something like  binds         or  binds    ""   will solve the problem  because current default value doesn't work properly and makes no sense 
sure  will do now 
i feel like the default scope should be included but instead of being part of the join clause   on       be appended to the where clause 
but i've seen this issue also in 3 0 x and 3 1 x  if i find the time i will try to reproduce this with 3 2 3 and add an example to reproduce it  it might also be some side effect of devise or other dependencies    i thought it's worth adding as a bug  cause i've seen it happening multiple times and others might stumble over this too

actually this was probably never intended  what was likely intended is to mimic templaterenderer and allow the partial to provide content_for  content_slot to the layout  which the layout would render with yield  content_slot  that requires that the partial be rendered first  however this too is broken as the yield args from the layout are discarded  i am not sure what's more useful  having the partial render first and provide content to the layout or for the layout to render first and influence the rendering of the partial  perhaps both styles should be supported via an option  currently neither is  whoever designed this should provide some insight 
i don't see it defining a new block  it stores the passed block in  block and ignores it  you can see render_partial utilizing the block   but collection_with_template ignores it 
1  this "side effect" that was there probably from the beginning of form field helpers 2  as to whether it's unwanted  how can you possibly believe that a lossy join ' '  is better than a lossless to_s  effectively json   as i mentioned you can't reliably parse values out of a join    'a b'  'c d'   
the problem of  relation#include   needlessly loading the relation just to check for membership  this problem was already solved for associations  there is of course a workaround   #exists    but  #include   is the canonical ruby rails way to check for membership  so it should work as well as  #exists  
i am new to rails  if i give the command 'bundle install   trace' it still fails  where can i find the stacktrace 
which one  because 4 1 1 is the version that error happens 
t column like we use t string t binary can we use t longblob in rails 4 or t blob
thank you  you are correct  i was missing the  dependent option  marty on sat  2013 01 12 at 15 42  0800  matt jones wrote 
you're right   this works on rails master 
 fxn thank you  it works  i'll send a pr to update the doc
yeah i figured that would be the case  i'll go create an issue there now linking to this as well  https   github com glejeune ruby graphviz issues 65 it doesn't error when i try to extend the model  it just seems to fail silently  then when i go to call a method that should have been added by the concern it raises nomethoderror  this happens at class eval time in my example because i extend my model to add a class method and then use that in the class body later  so basically silent failure but no changes have occurred to the class  as if the model hadn't been extended at all 
yes  am's default is false  but ar's default is true
i tested it using 3 2 10  3 2 11 and 3 2 12  same problem  changed to ruby 1 9 3 and started to work 
here is a rails project with a bad structure sql file  https   github com carolfs rails issue 9518
if to remove "dependent   destroy"  it then issues update statement which is destructing as well  also tries rails 3 0 x  it issues update statement always 
same thing happens with a has_many so just used that since i know how to get the generated sql 
thanks for the try rafael  i'll look into adding the test  from ar jdbc  into ar but it might take me a day or two  i'm kind of finishing up with a  4 0 compatible  release 
sure  i'll reference this issue 
it's the same code but the way in which options are passed through is different  here  https   github com rails rails blob 84650022d574d24d6adea6ad941ec3ca57d2a2f0 actionview lib action_view helpers tag_helper rb#l235 l241  
yup  what does that mean do 
 rafaelfranca rspec  the same test suite runs fine on top of 4 0 0 beta1  the setting  use_transactional_fixtures   true  is being ignored  our current workaround is 
posted from the wrong branch before  updated with the correct schema file 
sorry  i gave a bad example  here's a simple example https   github com graduss sample git  the problem appears when uploading large files 
sure  that's my example app  https   github com apat test app
 pftg and  dmathieu i've updated the issue with versions tested  i've created a sample application that address this issue  https   github com kevinsjoberg rails_console_helper_bug 
ruby 2 1 0p0  2013 12 25 revision 44422   x86_64 linux  trace is a little bit too long  2000 lines so i'll put it to http   vpaste net 8w5vk   note that i stripped couple of lines from there which are related to my project and it's private  sorry 
sweet  thanks a lot  senny  
no  i don't  i believe this could be the cause  but since i am mentioning the 'name' attribute in the method   and providing a value to it   the record should be created with the attribute  both methods  find_or_create_by and first_or_create  should behave the same way 
good to know  thanks  the only initializer i have that might try  is the rails_admin initializer  but i'm telling it to blacklist the contract model  https   gist github com willc0de4food 786b86ae8bc8bbe27eb9

just imagine the method is defined in a gem you use if you want  it really doesn't matter  what matters is that if such method exists the result is more then problematic

thanks robin850 for the comment  it does really look from the source though that rails is trying to support the postgres money datatype as there is explicit code to cope with it in the connectionadapters module of postgresql_adapter rb  it may not be used that often though hence my discovery of the issue    craig
yes  sure i will  just give me some time to prepare a sample code at github  i will upload sample code  but i can't provide full code of app i am working on 
i have also tried    and it yields the same results as eql 
it violates the principle of least surprise  i might want to pass a hash into  respond_with  and then use it later in the action  e g  to send it into a logger  currently the hash will pick up random controller internal state 
 sample app  https   github com cannie sampleapp  when i go to http   localhost 3000  i see correct output  as i expected 
i tried creating a new rails app with the same before_filter that causes the infinite loop but don't manage to reproduce the issue  any hint on what to check on my app 
https   gist github com werner 6c6560495099e29ffc01
i've tried on 4 0 0 and 4 0 1
 senny  i've created the following gist including my test case  https   gist github com rcook 7670071 it turns out that this only happens when using the postgresql database adapter  sqlite3 doesn't exhibit this behaviour  i've also updated the title of this issue to reflect this  if this bug should be filed elsewhere  e g  the bug tracker for the  pg  gem   please let me know and i'll move it 
it's  mime  rss  
i'm using the master branch  eileencodes thanks for tracking that down  prathamesh sonpatki anyone know if  tenderlove plans to give this another go and get it reimplemented 
 rafaelfranca  the sql generated by  #to_sql  is incorrect  the sql statement only selects from  collections   but it filters by  things collection_id   if i try to run it 
hi  laurocaetano  thanks for the quick reply  i am running 4 0 2  with latest stable ruby 2 1 0  the script doesn't work on 2 1 0   rvm rubies ruby 2 1 0 lib ruby 2 1 0 minitest unit rb 26 in  const_missing'  uninitialized constant minitest  test  nameerror   i am compiling 2 0 0 p353 now   
will try over the next day or two  the change to the code itself is almost certainly trivial  i'm just not sure where to put the test   railties test application runner_test rb  looks like where current tests for this are  not  railties test commands    have i got that right 
sorry to bother you  it looks like fresh install of the rails does not have this issue  i had to rollback to the old rails and gems  one thing to note that  accepts_nested_attributes_for  profile  fixed this issue  but many other have popped up  so i had to stop this update and rollback everything 
thank you
in a typical controller spec  i might call   it wasn't quite as ugly back when i could just pass a hash to  with  
 rafaelfranca i will as soon as i get an opportunity   this bug has me running around like a mad man to fix production
i'm sorry  i have been caught up in another project   mikedhart if you could provide a sample app  i'm glad to see i'm not the only one facing this issue  i'd be really thankful 
well  as the gist shows  when you call model column_for_attribute  aliased_attribute_name  it returns nullcolumn  or nil in 4 0   whereas it would be nice  if it returned the same thing as model column_for_attribute  original_attribute_name   in my case  i'm building a rails app on legacy db  shared with some other app  so i use alias_attribute a lot  the thing is  i don't want any other code apart from the model itself to know  that the actual column is named differently  aliased attribute names work for create  update  etc  they don't work for find  where and pluck but this can be worked around using scopes  custom finders  etc  but i consider column_for_attribute a part of the introspection api  which is why i think it should take attribute aliases into consideration 
o k   i published the project on github  diospi test_uninitialized_constant_proyecto all you have to do is go to the page  cb axientos new and press the save button and the error comes  i found out  that i used the method 'proyecto' twice  in models cb axiento_det rb  belongs_to  proyecto in modules axiento_dets_autocomplete_methods rb  method proyecto
 rafaelfranca sory for the late answer   i've been away for a few days   n seems to do the trick on my test app  but in my application it doesn't work  so i started searching for the problem and found out  that installing the influxdb rails gem destroys the live functionality  so this doesn't seems to be a rails problem   it's a influxdb rails problem 
 kuldeepaggarwal oh ok  how can i parse the date string in the correct time zone 
yep  since there are basically the same and mine was first 
i don't know  the project where this is from is over 20k lines of code and since i don't know much about rails class caching mechanism  i don't how deep i have to go to build a meaningful standalone application reproducing the error  now  i inquired a bit futher  in the   rb files where i include the module  if i remove the  require_relative incrementable rb   the problem disappears  which for me isn't terrific since i need the require for my minitest environnment  i found a hack to still be able to run the app without class caching  i simply add a  defined   check   i hope it helps  i can forward further info if needed 
hmm  this seems to work  https   gist github com muichkine 2468a74c4dae4db6995c three possibilities i could see  1   it really is linked to  require_dependancy  but that seems really far fetched 2   this fails due to some reason linked to the fact that my class is called transaction  also far fetched  3   this is linked to my underlying adapter  activerecord sqlserver adapter  i'll see if i can narrow that 
 sgrif yes but this particular test case is for "test_main_thread_variable_in_enumerator" 
thanks for the quick response  indeed  i see now that this issue is resolved on master  apparently by commit 218105f58e30bc9487ad59fa455878c35262a0a5  
i'm so far unable to reproduce the problem when i try to boil it down to a script  but i am still looking into it 
  both dbs  legacy and current  have a table called  users  
just changed the title of this issue to "updates with optimistic locking ignores #attributes_for_update" since it does not seem to be related to setting partial writes to false  if i put a  binding pry  in the  test_partial_update_with_optimistic_locking  method and call  person save   twice without setting the partial write to false  i can see that  keys_for_partial_write  is called and i get expected dirty behavior  however  once  person partial_writes   false  is set  i can easily see that  keys_for_partial_write  or anything below like my  attributes_for_update  is not called  maybe this method should go back to using  arel_attributes_with_values_for_update   oh yea  twice  here is the sql from my end when  person partial_writes   false  for both  person save   results  see how it has all attributes twice  sql server can cope with the identity insert  but not the update 
 maclover7 please delete this issue    it is invalid    sorry 
whoops    sorry about that  here it is 
no  i don't think so  because here the exact same object is used for both queries  and it's serialized exactly the same way in each   here the change in behavior seems to come from the inclusion of the fractional part  this behavior appears to be recent  i e  rails 4 1 6 does not do this   i've included the corresponding sql below 
strangely  i can't replicate it with a test script either  but  here's a basic app  https   github com georgemillo rails issue 23241 demo  that replicates the error  pull it  run the migrations  open up the console and try  m   model new created_at   time now     just to confirm  i'm getting this error with ruby mri 2 3 0 on a mac  and that app is loading rails at commit 6dfab475ca23 
i've been doing my development in mysql    i'm working on getting sqlite installed so i can reproduce the problem with it  i was planning on posting the  source of the  test case app i've been working on  once i get it a little more cleaned up    i'm most of the way there  i think that would be faster easier for me than figuring out that bug report template  would my approach be as useful  or nearly so  as using the bug report template 
it ended up being that uglifier had been removed from the gemfile from mistake 
it doesn't matter whether i don't set autosave or set it to false or true  i still behaves this way  updated code that works as expected if you have a database set up accordingly 
that might be the decision  but then that should be documented 
sure  our feature spec looks something like this 
it's 4 1 6

you're totally right  but i'm pretty new to rails and figured that i might let it to someone who would use better words than me to describe that behavior  i haven't looked at any part of the code yet  so i can't be sure that what i would describe would be completely right  some day  i hope i'll know enough about rails to contribute actively  but for now i'm not too comfortable with it
 ptashman it's less that i want to look up a non existent object  and more that i'd rather the issue was handled by my validation rather than erroring out immediately  often we assign association id values from a user  form or api  to a model  for example   person update_attributes params require  person  allow  name   role_id     if the  role_id  is out of range  that should be able to be returned to the user via a validation error  eg  "role does not exist"  no need to reveal too much about our database   rather than resulting in a 500 
what's wrong exactly with  the documentation  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord connectionadapters schemastatements html#method i add_column   is it the whole statement  or only a part of it  furthermore i find it useful to be able to pass options  such as  index  true   to  add_column   are you sure that is only documentation that needs to be fixed and not the code 
 rafaelfranca  sure i will try to do this
 sgrif  i updated the gist and set the gems to use the master branch  i reran the program and i can still reproduce the issue 
 arthurnn created test app https   github com piton4eg live
is it i misunderstand  the parameter start_day will not override the config beginning_of_week   it is just ask the day of previous week  not set the beginning_of_week to be the day 
that's weird  but it worked   smile 
sure  but writing an amf request could take some time  i'll report back when i have a good test code 
returns a blank line
probably the output of  db schema dump  shouldn't come when we run the migrations with  db migrate   this  question on stackoverflow  http   stackoverflow com questions 28955822 odd rake dbmigrate output  has some discussion on it too 
👍🏻😉
 rafaelfranca sorry  yes that does it  closing
thanks for responding  here is the test  https   gist github com taylorhg d0736567612beee22c97
the error we got in our app was quite a few degrees removed from the actual issue  i'll see if i can cook up a simpler example project to demonstrate the issue 
test_helper rb  https   gist github com frankpinto 789816c049ea535e12df test  https   gist github com frankpinto 652d358a0721af2fa42d new command   disable_spring true rails_env "test kender" bin rake test test models company_test rb test_save_logo   rafaelfranca i tried it and got the same error  couldn't connect to postgres   here's some more information    i checked with the debugger  pry + byebug  again  placed as the first line in postgresqladapter initialize   execution his this line 3 times   every time execution hit the debugger i checked rails env and it was 'test kender' everytime   i also checked the value of 'config' parameter  the first time it corresponded to the config of 'test kender'  the second time it looks like the default config  after this it throws the postgres error   the third time it corresponded to the config of 'test kender' again    the test threw an error at line 14 with the error  nomethoderror  undefined method 'logo' for nil nilclass 
 rafaelfranca sure  will do that soon  raised it as an issue to check if i am missing something  a rails rookie here 
hello   senny  thank you for replying  imagine this scenario  1   two days ago a mate wrote a migration to add a reference  column + fk    in my view add_reference method does not have more useful options such as reference_table_name or column_name to customise the column and fk created

oh  you are right  thanks  this can be closed 
here it is    this was the simpliest way to attach sorry for the docx format     issue22484 docx  https   github com rails rails files 50986 issue22484 docx 
i will give it a whirl
 kamipo if you use the template above  the test breaks with  10679c2cbd25550f6625dcac0d9f813e8e91b2ab  but doesn't with  10679c2cbd25550f6625dcac0d9f813e8e91b2ab     90c033984f38e40c2ff53c036d89ee22c88fadab   
sure  it looks like that after creating a record  unicode string is returned in encoded format like   "nov xc3 xbd"    which causes the problem  i think  reloading record after creating it fixes the issue 
hy  hansondr   thanks for the help  i confirm the script triggers the same error 
i don't have any integration test right now  i'm still working at controller level  however i've found out that it works  actually kind of     if i pass both params and body keywords   i e  it seems that if parameters are passed in a post request  request raw_post  is populated accordingly  the inverse is not true  in my case i cannot pass parameters because signature is computed against the raw body string and passing it as parameter hash keep values but not the order of them in raw body 
 al2o3cr this was working perfectly with rails 4 0 0 before i upgraded  i have pasted the cleaned database yml below  thanks for your help  database yml 
i'am using  4 1 14 
sure  maclover7 i attached a sample zip and the command i use 
 maclover7 no problem  i'm new to getting the test suite to work  so i don't know exactly what i'm doing yet  but the test would be very simple  like this  https   gist github com brchristian 93c58db70aa10fa0bdca#file limit_last_test rb l35 l42
sorry  close this  my brain is fried today 
i am not getting any error not in js neither in rails console just the thing that the speak function is not being called when i try to submit a form which is in the channel but if i explicitly run from browser console it works then it also starts working from the ui
this only seems to happen when  jbuilder  is a dependency  i'll have a sample app up in a second 
 maclover7 thank you for response  you helped me debugging and solved my issue  i created a  gist  https   gist github com haslinger b08b473e63574ba33196   that proved me wrong  the response is correct  what misled me was  that i was using wget for testing the response  that doesn't load the body for the status 422 case  while curl does it correctly  thank you for your time 
i'll try and report here   maclover7 
 guilleiguaran this gives me the same error  nothing changed
thanks for the suggestion   y yagi  we’re currently employing that as a workaround but it means adding a new column is a two deploy process   first deploy adds the soon to be added column to ignored_columns   and then another deploy to add the column in a migration  and remove the column name from ignored_columns    we’re hoping to avoid having to spread this over two deploys to get zero downtime 
i'll see if i can carve out a bit of time to do a pr 
alright  i have a feeling that this was a reasonable request designed to uncover the root of the problem  i spun up a fresh machine  installed rails  copied the templates to  lib templates erb scaffold    ran  rails generate scaffold class name string   and it worked  changes were carried through to the generated view  what troubleshooting steps are suggested to track this down on the machine with the issue  on that machine  rails 5 was installed as an rvm gemset  loosely following http   railsapps github io updating rails html  
will do  thanks 
 robin850  thanks for reply  i can create pr soon  
 rafaelfranca yes  indeed it works with  v5 0 0 rc1   so probably this won't be fixed in  4 2   just out of curiosity  do you know why this works in rails 5 
i do not  just an update  i restarted all of the vms  and in this case  "turning it off and back on" seemed to resolve the issue  we can mark this matter as closed 
for me that is a questions  should this be fixed in rack or in actionpack 
i generated application with  rails new rails_playground  successfully but running  bin rails c  fails with similar error   details     details  thought that an issue with my ruby installation but apps like  irb  work well 
 untitled1 zip  https   github com rails rails files 341966 untitled1 zip  if you run this project and go to http   localhost 3000 examples  you will see a blank page  however  if you delete line 26 in untitled1 app views examples index html erb which is    # todo testing    with no spaces or other characters after the    you will then see listing examples new example this shows that an injected remark with no spaces will cause a blank page to display 
 maclover7 it could be but i'm not really sure  the issue here is i have an array of hashes and i know all values are passed since they are there but for some reason the hashes are merged into one  if i try to work with the params in a controller action the array always has just one hash rather than what was actually sent  i'm not really sure if its strong parameters related since an integration test works fine which is weird since that uses more of the full rails stack  when it comes to controller tests i don't know how much stubbed under the hood  my guess is strong parameters is the same in both which makes this weirder  either way this replicates what i noticed after upgrading to rails 5 _without any changes_ but again this only happened to me when the params contained an array of hashes  it doesn't seem to happen in other cases 
i was trying to serialize  request env  in sinatra and found it'a ok when only requiring "json" but bugs when requiring "active_support"  so introducing "active_support" just breaks the existing code  right 
the column type is  datetime   haven't had the time for a demo app yet 
 maclover7 unfortunately  i don't think that would do much good  as we've only seen it once and i don't have any way of reproducing it  we saw another constant loading error recently  but it was in the aws sdk gem  so seems unrelated 
 rafaelfranca   i have just pushed up my sample application at https   github com vincentlkl rails5 i have tried to set the action_cable configuration at the actioncable yml still i am not getting anything 
this is straight out of the getting started exercise  i am not qualified to debug it  sent from my google nexus 6  on sep 16  2016 15 08  "प्रथमेश sonpatki" notifications github com wrote 
thank you  mechanicles for quick response  i've checked and my model and i can confirm that it doesn't have  optional  true  attribute  however if i set up up with  required  attribute   in fact i get expected behaviour     "status"  422  "error"  "unprocessable entity"  "exception"  "# activerecord  recordinvalid  validation failed  author must exist "   however seeting  required  true  restricts me from nullifying author for the post on updates  and one of the requirements is ability to set author of the post to  null   is there a way to validate foreign_key object  only if  author_id  is not  null   that way i could only allow for  author_id  to be  null  or be a valid id 
i'm not aware of an option to change the dump format  where can i see what format rails is using   thus  i am certain that i'm using the default format  
sure  i've been using rails for years but never contributed to core so i'd be happy to  i'll read the how to contribute and take a crack at it 
okey here you go   https   gist github com praveenkumarsinha a0e77684ba12e69f6c02cff2f2197d03
monday i will try to replicate it in my test app   
sure 
sorry for my premature comment in that case  i did a search through the repo and couldn't find any references  but should have been more thorough  the case we were running into is that setting  rails configuration i18n available_locales  did not propagate to  i18n available_locales  which we just assumed incorrectly  since we do some internationalization outside the core functionality
where can i find logs for this error  there is no indication of what is going on i can't find anything that could be causing this i've already reinstalled ruby  rvm  tryied to upgrade ruby version  nothing makes the app work
agreed  removing the validation was actually how i got past this  just wasn't expecting the presence to evaluate false  nil and false  rather than nil  i like that defining validations self documents code and the model to some extent  and there may be instances where you want someone to explicitly define a boolean field and not set a default value  force thought and a decision        on wed  23 nov 2016 19 18 03 +1000utilum  lt notifications github com gt  wrote      why do you need to validate presence if you have a default value  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread 
sorry for the delay  here is the example project  https   github com johan smits rails add foreign key there are 2 commits  one after  bundle update  to the 6 0 version  and one after  rails migrate  
 kaspth if you check out that sample app i linked to there are two tests  they both pass on the  rails 4 2  branch and one fails on the  rails 5  branch 
ok  i will do it  this day
here is it   identified_by  current_user def connect self current_user   find_verified_user logger add_tags 'actioncable'  "user # current_user id " end protected def find_verified_user if current_user   user find_by_identity cookies signed  identity_id  current_user else reject_authorized_connection end end 
after further investigation  it turns out an ill conceived monkey patch in my app affecting arrays was to blame  thank you for your time and bringing my attention to the reproduction scripts 
checked out the test database in rails 4 2 5  as  rafaelfranca pointed out  it worked in rails 4 2 because  db test purge  was called  what could be the ideal work around  i have added the trace of  db creat  for rails 4 2 and 5 0  trace from rails 4 2 5
thanks  rafaelfranca  i can confirm its related to that passenger issue and is fixed in passenger 5 1 1 
thanks for the quick response  sure  i should be able to create a pr in the next couple days 
i provided an example application in https   github com kdiogenes generator class collision  in the readme there i already put the output for the commands  rails g scaffold_controller name string email string  and  rails g controller users name string email string   for the first  there is no complaint about  userscontroller  already being used in the application 
 kamipo  vipulnsward thank you for your answers   i send pr  but is this issue done   anyway i'm glad the unclarified issue was solved 
yes  https   github com gamezj actioncable ec2 git   this problem is in aws
thanks for your replies  rafaelfranca and  ztsuperman  i read through that documentation  and i've observed it functioning as described in other controllers  however  it still seems to be behaving inconsistently in this particular example  perhaps for reasons that  ztsuperman described   one  because there is no model  foo   and two because it only does this wrapping when  foo  is passed as  false   for example  doing the same reproduction steps above  except curling with parameters with  foo  as  0  instead of  false    here is a repository of the rails app i am testing with  which was made using the reproduction steps in this issue  https   github com motevets rails_param_same_name_as_controller is this a bug  it seems odd that it wraps the parameters when a parameter with same name of the controller is set to  false   but not for any other values 
 meinac i have some other projects on my machine and all are working fine except one  i don t know how to debug because error info is very generic and small  i cannot share that project because companies privacy policies  please can you give me a hints to fix this 
i generated a small app that reproduces the error here  https   github com cjlarose rails 6 uninitialized constant html repro the commit history is clean  but roughly the steps were 1   rails _5 2 2_ new   skip sprockets   skip listen repro    cd repro  1  set  gem 'rails'  '6 0 0 beta2'  in the gemfile 1  remove the  web console  gem from the gemfile 1  add the  config  gem to the gemfile 1   bundle update rails  1   bundle exec rails app update # accept changes to config appliction rb  then quit  1   bundle exec rake active_storage update # uninitialized constant error  from debugging my own application and trying to generate this repro app  i found that these two conditions are necessary 1   actioncontroller  base  is loaded before  this initializer in  actiontext   0  runs  2  the gem  rails html sanitizer  isn't loaded before the same initializer runs   0   https   github com rails rails blob v6 0 0 beta2 actiontext lib action_text engine rb#l31 l35 the  config  gem is just one way to make sure the first condition is satisfied since it references  actioncontroller  base  explicitly in its  initializer  1   1   https   github com railsconfig config blob 1 7 0 lib config integrations rails railtie rb#l26 l32 removing the  web console  gem is necessary here to ensure the second condition is satisfied  the reason that i generated the app with    skip sprockets  and    skip listen  is that it'll expand the statement to  require 'rails all'  in the generated  config application rb   if the application uses  require 'rails all'  instead of listing out the frameworks explicitly  the error doesn't happen  something else  require s the  rails html sanitizer  before the  actiontext  initializer runs   lastly  the problem is a little more widespread than i thought  it's not really related to  bundle exec rake active_storage update   for example  in this repro app  even    bin rails console  fails with the same error 
i would like  db schema rb  to also use bigint when using references  as it already happens for mysql and postgresql  that way  db schema rb  will be the same for all adapters  at least on this topic  and the documentation  which now says that default type is bigint  will be accurate 
actual the instance of cat is doing the confusing thing now  how about this

 y yagi please find a link for a new rails app here   https   github com mayordwells calculator math
i will report it ruby core  but i don't think that it is necessary to use       to convert keys 
 georgeclaghorn i eventually managed to find the culprit after your suggestion of creating a sample app  it turns out that i was mistakenly using this in my controller   by using  post new    and    attach  i was basically attaching each file twice which explains both the invalid signature  i think  and the duplicate record errors  even though  for some reason  it was working when using  direct_upload  false    maybe the docs could have been a little more helpful on this one but it was mostly and mainly my mistake  thank you for your prompt response and my apologies for wasting your time on an issue which was not a rails bug  please feel free to close this one

you are right  another gem was using the gem composite_primary_keys that triggered the error  thank you  https   github com composite primary keys composite_primary_keys blob v10 0 3 lib composite_primary_keys attribute_set builder rb
thanks for looking in to this  your patch works and is similar to a workaround i'm using now  i've implemented it here https   shielded beach 23078 herokuapp com  with some basic annotation as to where the event came from  i can see from the source that  fire  should bubble up the custom event  https   github com rails rails blob fe4e9d4c5d82806fdaf28c87c731132f81f0ac3e actionview app assets javascripts rails ujs utils event coffee#l37 my understanding from this is the events from the ujs loaded content are getting fired   they are just not bubbling to document up like the events from the initial content  is that correct

we are using  sneakers  https   github com jondot sneakers  gem to perform some database transactions   the passed in message "data"  was this    “account_id“ 372 “amount“ 26000 0 “description“ “invoice # 907“  “debit“ true “current_balance“ 0 0   the concerning thing is that this error i am seeing is not consistent  but rather pops up at random making my whole system unreliable unless i implement a fallback to this error  hope this helps

 sikachu yes  i plan on submitting a pr  could you clarify what you mean by  make it extendable for other gems owner  
i think that the conditional validation is executed twice because when i remove the format validator the error is added only once

removed everything that i've added to application rb  added api as an acronym and now it works  thanks 
no am unable to reproduce this issue
hello  rafaelfranca i simply get the impression that rails  and world at large  is moving away from ie8 support  so there is no need to transmit this header anymore you have accepted the pr  #32125  that sets  rails application config action_controller default_enforce_utf8  to  false  by default in rails 6  which kind of signals that you want to move away from older ie versions  v8 being one of them
sure  i'll look at adding tests for this and send a pr

hi  we have only  select  granted for replica user and  use  works  it is not explicitly mentioned in mysql documentation but i think that when user is granted  select  privilege to some database he can also do the  use  statement  because one can do   when granted  select  to both  db1  and  db2    the query does  use db1   and selects from  db2  too  i assume one could do  use db2   also because i could not find a separate  use  grant type in documentation   example from https   dev mysql com doc refman 5 7 en use html

i used mysql2 gem 
thanks  then i try openssh i got console window with password prompt  all work nice  in my case no difference between which ssh clients to use     thanks again 
i don't have a public repository  it happens with a private git svn repository tracking an svn origin  i'll try to replicate with a public repository 
i've a  properties file and an  xml file in the commit   but doesn't seems related to a specific file extension
 pull'd   http   github com stanangeloff gitextensions commit 1cd4309538823bb0090f84b1a197ec2182d86783 
everything is false there  including isdirtydir
no  that is it then  will install latest  net framework  thank you 
yes it was the first setting  not sure when or why i enabled that  thanks for the help 
happens every time on win7x64  restart it is same  no running out of memory  i compile the code with vs2013 on master branch  but 2 48 branch is ok 
yeah  i'm not able to reproduce  but it happened  i'm still looking for a sure fire repro 
did they  do i need to wait for a new release of git extensions or do i just update msysgit on its own 
winmerge  but it’s the same if i set it to kdiff3  no launch just on commit  works if also the other one gets selected  the difftool         local options in the context menu also work fine  only the ‘open with difftool’ fail  i found the reason too  internal diff uses command git cmd diff   unified 3   patience  m  c "b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e " "b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e"    "language hungarian fdres_hun rc" while the difftool one  git cmd difftool   gui   no prompt  m  c b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e  b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e    "language hungarian fdres_hun rc" note the missing “” around the hash  the   is a special character to cmd exe  and must be escaped  quoted  or rather  not used  to avoid such problems ge should use  1 instead of   consistently  it works fine outside quotes 
no  i didn't try that actually  not a cmd line fan    but i uninstalled and reinstalled the older gitextensions 2 31 and it works fine in that  using same recent version of git   i also tried making commits via git gui and that works fine also  so i'm fairly confident something broke in 2 32 
i run putty pageant
i currently work with a framework  where all the submodules are placed in 1 main directory  eg libraries  so we we libraries module1  libraries module2 etc  sometimes for testing etc  new ones can be put there just by copying source etc  having a gitignore for the libraries directory keeps any mess out of the main repo 
c  git
i'm using version 2 46  i do not remember using it previously 
just fyi  i reproduced this twice before i posted here  but i didn't take good notes  where did i get the installation  etc    let me reproduce it and i'll update this thread with how i found this problem  it should be really easy to see   then again  i would have expected a lot of "me too" posts to this thread and i'm not seeing any  this makes me think the issue is on my end   thanks for your continued curiosity   craig p s  it does look like the installer is attempting to ask or install the latest msysgit 
sorry that i did not describe it precisely enough    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 642928 29937070 9decc36a 8e84 11e7 8f65 a24217799870 png

hello  i installed version 2 44 and could not reproduce this issue  i suppose it has been fixed already   regards 
sorry for the late response   i currently use three different oss  win7  ubuntu 12 04  only for testing purposes  don't really care about stability  so things may be broken there  and some older ubuntu distro  my main os  with a manually compiled mono   but i only built gitext on the first two  because my main distro is too old   and i have a different checkout of the repo for each os  so that shouldn't be a problem  and on win7 i usually reset the repo if i should switch between vs2012 and xamarin studio   gitextensionsv2 46_9415954 tar gz  worked with  mono   debug   on win   at least on a smaller repo  hang up on the gitext repo  but maybe i should have given it more time or should have waited with trying to interact with the window  
currently running 7 ultimate on an rmbp15 with 200  scaling  i'll get back to you in a few hours once i reboot to 8 1  this has been happening for a long time but was hidden behind dpi virtualization  so the program was able to function despite fuzziness  recently you force disabled it in the manifest  see 5fb8a0d3   rendering certain dialogs dysfunctional and many others very ugly 
it is obvious that i suggest to improve the algorithm so that if the line moves left at one commit and right in another  then this shall be replaced by a direct line  but i'm not able to formulate a general solution  i understand it is not easy to design such an improvement  i just wanted to point out one ugly corner case of the current code 
it uses gui dialogs instead of stdin stdout for requesting things like verifying an host key or authenticating  msysgit's installer already looks for a tortoiseplink install from any existing tortoisesomething install and will prefer it over a normal plink  and it seems even git extensions does this as it selects to use tortoisesvn tortoiseplink instead of the bundled plink by default when i enabled it to use putty  so why not just bundle tortoiseplink and default to using our own bundled copy of tortoiseplink instead of depending on the user installing some tortoise install and leeching of it's tortoiseplink to improve the user experience  btw  if you do bundle tortoiseplink and change it's exe name from plink to tortoiseplink  the msysgit installer might need to be updated to recognize that 
will do and report back  manually downloading from sf now  help    check for updates does not show the update yet  
it looks similar  but i can't say much more as i'm not familiar with the code internals  i don't 
i have tested with a different file type so i don't think it's ssis related   created new repository using git extensions in d  test  create new solution and add a text file  save to d  test changes are recorded but i can only browse the repository when the the file is open and selected in the solution explorer but all other icons are grayed out  if i select the top level i e solution  all buttons are active but do not work   screenshot 1  http   f0re co uk 1 jpg   screenshot 2  http   f0re co uk 2 jpg  i can only commit from within gitextensions itself 
not that i'm aware of  however  following a full restart  this doesn't recur 
i've done pr #3018  i found  that change in  loaddictionary  was enough to fix this  should i include changes in  dispose    too 
no i haven't  do i have to press "suggest" button  the following pass is proposed  "    gitextensions gitcredentialwinstore git credential winstore exe" is it an assembly which saves credentials 
 vbjay just beautify ui
a volume is a simple windows drive  letter  e g  c    d          all volumes seem to be highlighted because they all look the same and there is no possibility to select any drive letter 
it's just a way to make sure that the commit history isn't full of dumb commits 
not yet  only built it first time on linux  been using it only on windows so far   will report back if i see it 
hi  radrik5 ticket solved the issue  i'm using a too old version of git  thanks a lot for your help 
 pmiossec it not always happened  but i'll try 
sorry it is  projects teamplay  git  it's just the markdown removing one     the commitmessage file is there with the correct message 
it happens on all repositories  thanks 
just as my personal opinion  it would be nice to have the latest download on sourceforge  the download page says there are 2000+ downloads of gitextensions _  per week  _ from sourceforge  at most version 2 50  not the latest  since it isn't available there   also  sourceforge is under new management as of 2 years ago that claims to no longer do those things  i can't vouch for their honesty    https   sourceforge net blog sourceforge acquisition and future plans   https   sourceforge net blog sourceforge acquisition and future plans   edit  i'm obviously not speaking for my employer here  i just personally found gitextensions on sourceforge several years ago  and hope that others will continue to be able to find it if they look there 
 russkie no  tags are deleted correctly 
thanks  exactly what i need  the only noticeable difference is that you can configure commands not only for context menu on commit in the graph but for branch context menu  side bar  and file context menu  down  
possibly  but i cannot understand if there's anything i can do 
https   github com gitextensions gitextensions releases the revision graph code is rewritten in version 3 00  it works as i would hope in this build  specifically    git extensions 3 00 00 03 rc2   8cbcd2b25223c73fbe9f7dad08e498cf82734bfa  dirty  i have not tried the 4308 build  but i'd be happy declaring this request resolved with new default behavior 
as references are frequently stored in the names of files  in the git ref folder   i would suggest picking the longest usual file name length  which is 255 for both windows and linux  anyone who picks a longer branch or tag name will most probably have many more issues than only a crashing gitextensions 
sorry it took so long to get back to you  just tried with 3 1 0 5877 and it's still happening    gitextensionsversion  https   user images githubusercontent com 8247176 57948161 c447a280 7895 11e9 9ba4 19b1b483cf93 png

how do i verify that i have the remote repository as a "remote repository"  i do have it as "origin" in the "remote repositories" window 
i cannot reproduce the issue myself now  i tried it multiple times now  incl the appveyor build   and the build works  the only explanation i have is that i had a incomplete plugin folder  and after diffing i noticed the missing dll in the root folder of the msi  and i  incorrectly  assumed the dll has to be in this place  this can be closed in favor of #7173 sorry for the inconvenience

hello  thanks for your fast answer  in our lab  we develop several libraries with unit tests  application tests and bindings  they are git modules and they have submodules  which are often dependencies that we need to build   for industrial or research projects  we need to develop applications that rely on one or several of our libraries  in this case they are used as submodules  and for simplicity we prefer having just one level of sub modules without recursivity  for instance  if an application depends on libraries a and b  with a depending on c and d  and b on d and f  then we have our application as a git module depending on submodules a  b  c  d  e and f

good question  _site index html no subject folder or index file _site page2 html i tried this in my config file  baseurl  localhost 4000 but that didn't work 
i did what is the right version of pygments rb  at the moment i am on 0 6 3 
it's unclear how to create a new site using the jekyll documentation  now that i know how to do it  it could've been explained in like 4 lines on the site and saved me a couple hours  somewhere it needs to say  1  in your repository in command line  type jekyll new new site name  2  this cannot be accessed at username github io  it must be accessed at username github io new site name  it was also unclear how to install a theme which took me forever to figure out  steps like this could be helpful on the site  1  find a theme you like and go to repository containing it  2  click fork in top right corner  3  add a branch called gh pages  4  go to branches tab and set gh pages as default  5  look under settings to see new url to access theme  it will not be where your main files are but in a folder  example url would be username github io theme name adding instructions to the site will make it ten times easier for new people to figure out how to get started with jekyll  on sat  aug 5  2017 at 3 18 am  pat hawks  notifications github com  wrote 
that works   for some reason i couldn't hit on the right syntax to make it work everywhere when i tried that initially  but i must not have been trying very hard  i also assumed that the purpose of the date being in the filename was about having metadata at a glance in the journal's directory  but didn't consider that it might only be there for the permalink  i'll close 
i've never had maruku parse my markdown without throwing warnings all over the place  rdiscount is rock solid  but is based off of c extensions  so i'm hoping kramdown might become the defacto markdown solution for the jrubyists  i will try to cook up a patch shortly 
i'm on windows  but i'm trying to do it in a vm with ubuntu and get  all the time  i'm very new to ubuntu  so i'll try some more things 
i'm hesitant regarding whether we should be so "strict" and really abort in such cases  i thought of producing the messages as warnings to the console  but still continue  but it's probably better to let the builds fail than to produce broken sites  especially for github pages users who probably never see the console  it already happened to me several times that i browsed one of my jekyll sites and suddenly found that some tag wasn't working   maybe for months  without me knowing 
 aiwilliams presumably your  _config yml  specifies  markdown  redcloth   jekyll supports a wide variety of markdown processors  but maruku is the only default processor in 0 11 0  others such as redcloth need to be installed explicitly by the user to avoid dependency bombing all jekyll users 
yeah  that's not a bad compromise    the links are not too long  but the images are still kept organized by article 
but the blog has been converted as  lt ol gt   lt li gt 选择一个中枢点p lt  li gt   lt li gt 将数组按中枢点分割为左右两份，左边的都小于p，右边的都大于p 3  按上述逻辑递归处理左右两个子数组 lt  li gt   lt  ol gt  the last two list were treated as only one li
gemfile is available  can you try without having bundler installed 
though encoding was already set to utf 8  recreating the file and copypasting the contents worked like charm  thanks 
the default markdown renderer  i suppose it is maruku  i'm on a fresh install of ruby and jekyll from ruby gem 
thanks  i did wonder if #890 was related  day of year is most useful for my purposes  and not all of the  liquid formatting options  http   liquid rubyforge org classes liquid standardfilters html#m000012  seem useful for permalinks  i tend to think zero padded numbers would be most valuable  in addition to   m  and   d   already provided  of course  i might consider      j    day of the year  001  366      u    week of the current year starting with sunday  00  53      w    week of the current year starting with monday  00  53      w    day of the week  sunday is 0  0  6      h    hour of the day  24 hour clock  00  23      m    minute of the hour  00  59      s    second of the minute  00  60  if i had to pick one it would be   j   might even call it  year_day  or something  very excited about the movement on 1 0  btw 
sorry for my english  i think i didn't say it clear enough  no  i didn't changed the version of my gem  i tested with  jekyll _0 12 1_   file http   cdn files tld  just now  it works  i think  site baseurl  is another thing  i use  site file  to define my image assets  which is different from my main site url  here's my setup    i defined  file  http   images repo local  in my  _config yml    http   images repo local  is a localhost where i store my images on my computer    then use   img href    site file    img png   in my post to show images    when it's ready to deploy  i use  jekyll   file http   cdn files tld  to change all images base url to a cdn url  which is sync'ed from my local repo  i think it's a good idea to add a    file  or    image  or    assets  flag  thanks 
i tried reinstalling ruby  updating rubygems  i even tried installing it on a windows laptop but the error is same on both  i guess i'll just have to wait to build my jekyll blog and host it on github  yeah  i'll be updating my mint soon    
the gem version is jekyll  1 0 2   the other required gems are also in sync with the versions used by github  my website is running fine locally  but i am not able to serve it via github  aniket on mon  may 13  2013 at 8 09 am  zach notifications github com wrote 
i see i didnt know that  and yes i have a index html in my  blog folder and it only generates page  regardless
that's a great idea  dropping plugins into the plugin folder encourages inlining dependencies  but is easy to use  the "_plugins ext rb" pattern is confusing to me  and only gets worse when you mix and match  something like 1  add gems to your gemfile 2  install gems 3  require gems in _config yml is way better  and easy enough that it could be the default recommendation  i like that this would let you switch which gems you're requiring by switching cascading config files 
just follow the _ error message guidelines  http   www nngroup com articles error message guidelines  _ by jakob nielsen  i do it for years  in addition to regular messages i would suggest some jekyll specific things  1  if you need the logo even here  change the top logo in a recognizable manner  e  g  remove the red liquid  always base 64 encode it  2  don’t forget to ask for help 
yes  i have in "_site en "
responsive is how i code  i was giving an example  my use for this was to make an xml copy of each page  such that i can make a  pjax  http   pjax heroku com   like system for my jekyll site  instead of using a different header request  use a different file   i believe this could have many helpful uses  including accessibility  developing custom apis for viewing content  and beta testing of themes 
i plan to use jekyll for a project documentation  my documentation is structure in several guide and module  each of them have subnavigation  so i have one default layout for the styles one by module defining a main navigation and one by guide to define the subnavigation  i think it's easier to be able to have each "guide layout" in a "module folder" right now i have everything in the same folder and it's a mess 
hey sorry about it  restart my computer really solve the problem  thanx
yes  i set baseurl to   project name   blog in my case  as recommended on http   jekyllrb com docs github pages   and have read access to the folder  i'm not sure how to check if webrick has access  but presume it does since it's creating the file within _site 
yeah   the really simple trick is to store an  emptyarray      in  _config yml   so each time we need a empty array to work with  push  or  unshift   we just have to do       assign myarray   site emptyarray    
i reproduce it   1  on github pages with jekyll 2 4 0  repo  https   github com djacquel jekyll collections test  and  preview  http   pygmeeweb com jekyll collections test        site collections col     returns a collection with all attributes  2  locally using ruby 2 1 8 and jekyll 3 0 2  we clearly see that  site collections col  returns nothing 
https   gist github com mattwillmott 6398509 hopefully that's what you were asking for 
no i haven't  should i 
i think it's a great idea  but i'd not call them renderers  because i think it's confusing for a newcomer to understand that a renderer transforms the content of a file  while a converter renders the final file  we could call them   transformers    but actually i think that limits them conceptually  really we're getting a context and some raw content  and "doing stuff" then returning some other content  we're imagining that "doing stuff" involves transforming the content  but we might be doing anything    logging the number of keywords to a database  for example  so really we're talking about   processors    but i could see an argument that anything a "processor" could do that didn't involve transformation should really belong in a generator    i'm on the fence  if we want a more focused type of plugin  transformer is a good name  if we want a more general purpose plugin  processor would work 
at the moment i'm only doing local tests  i hope this week i can push some finished work  i've just made a new site with  jekyl new      and no problems at all  i've also checked  configuration rb   v1 2 0  and  md  is included by default  i'll continue working and let you know soon  thanks

ah  you're right  it looks like i messed up the yaml by overwriting "layout" instead of calling "summary " my mistake  i appreciate the help 
certainly it's less urgent for me  but i'd like to turn this into a pull request  i still think it represents a hole in jekyll's support for kramdown 
nope  i got the same error 
i’ve just been experimenting on my own machine and github  the index page works by just changing the extension to xhtml but the layout templates don’t pass their extension onto the pages they generate 
 node   version      v0 10 26 
nope  same error as in #3084  btw  sorry for the duplicate 
i haven't changed anything from the default _config yml   just left it as it was out of the box    jekyll new project  
that does work – but of course  my setup requires me to declare different paths 
content of haml layout is displays as text  no errors 
i've moved on from jekyll for the moment and sadly can't spend the time  i did test the above code before proposing it  and it does work

aw man  don't say that     it should be the latest version of jekyll is installed  i believe 2 2 0  this was a completely fresh vm  created in azure this evening  and all components installed as described above  i e  get latest version  the only thing that i didn't install as the latest version was python  as i have read that the 3 version of python doesn't play nicely 
 parkr wrong repo indeed  thanks  we're proud to help make ghp speedy    
from what i understand it is a package file with the markdown document  all of the assets that are referenced and a metadata json file  the biggest benefit—in my opinion—is the standardised way of grouping assets  allowing for easy referencing  in a current site i have to do the following     site baseurl    project name  assets asset jpg   where as with textbundle it would become  assets asset jpg  and the build function would take care of the organisation of the assets 
doh  you're right  that has never worked  my bad    
wow  those issues stacked up fast  hadn't even noticed it  i installed command line tools again and re installed jekyll  to no avail  will test further and report back 
i would say it's not true to spec  which originated with this afaik  http   www aaronsw com 2002 atx intro  the behaviour is for me surprising and looks "untechnical"  but if it is intended  then nevermind

 alekst its more of a preference  i prefer more the 'package by feature' style over the 'package by layer'  having all related post images  and any other files  inside the post folder is easier to work with 
my use case is too complex to explain  doesn't have to be in the core  a separate plugin maybe 
as i said  this feature should just be for the dev of the site and not for serving users  in production  the dev can do a full build and deploy  chrome dev tools works but you have to duplicate the content  html  css  and it can't use liquid sass  there's no easy way to convert a large jekyll project to hugo metalsmith  this is an annoying workaround that i've employed too   kleinfreund you won't even want to wait 10 seconds to preview a trivial change  my site has about 2000 html pages and takes 1 2 mins  i don't think this is too hard to develop and no matter how slow jekyll becomes in the future  single pages won't take time and people can't complain about speed 
no  it doesn't work  disappointed  the file is generated dynamically by the gem   jekyll tagging   https   github com pattex jekyll tagging   edit  i notice this error occurs on 2 5 3  too  and also on a command prompt 
okay  here is the output   the error itself can be avoided by adding     if site categories example     tag  though  
hi  yep i've check the blog post html    it's for chang the date format with plugin 
 parkr just  gem 'github pages'   when remove  giflib   the problem disappeared  is there any possibility that the libraries of  giflib  conflict with  jekyll  
aarhh  just realised that this is this issue  https   github com jekyll jekyll watch issues 22 the affected files are starting with '_site' 
hi  i already got the fix  put a sticky bit to  tmp can solve the issue 
 kleinfreund in my _config yml  also same behavior occurs with redcarpet
just now i have had tried jekyll 3 beta 8   which should be   _site jekyll 2014 11 18 jekyll one step html  
jekyll 3 0 0 pre beta8  which was installed by default as a dependency for  gem install jekyll scholar  
it handles markdown files and creates liquid style templates   afterwards jekyll gets a configuration and renders liquid files to html  everything fine  but the file copies result in false content  it takes the old content which is not in the source anymore right now  the environment is the scotch box  https   box scotch io    maybe this is the problem   problem is only reproducible on host system ubuntu  host system windows 7 does it correct 
i tried to figure that out but every jekyll update  breaks my code  version 2 5 3     3 0 0 as well
add links to headers automatically  as seen in the 2nd example  and more flexibility  alternatively this could be done with a custom plugin  but then it wouldn't work on github pages  which's what i want it on  
i do not use plugins  unless you already have the jekyll default  i have no idea how to run that "listen_gen_debugging   1" command   
i pretty much create images as png by default  i'm using liquid to build documentation  i'm a tech writer  and figured it would work for images as well as text files  if that's not the case  no biggie  but i wanted to report it in case others tried to do the same and ran into the same error 
hi  i thought that ticket was related but i'd thought it'd throw the question in anyway  the company i work for uses  htm  and they wont change it for seo purposes no matter what i say  there is nothing i can do about this unfortunately  i would use  html all day long
http   emberwatch com recipes user_interface_and_interaction basic_form_validations_buggy html we are currently wrapping the codes in     html      raw     pairs but we wanted the single fenced one  was expecting for it to work since it renders well in github as markdown  https   github com greyhwndz emberwatch blob bugdemo htmlbars render improperly _recipes user_interface_and_interaction basic_form_validations_buggy md
it's missing the closing p tag  interesting  i've been looking at the results through chrome's developer tools  so i didn't notice 
easy enough  thanks  is there a maintained list of the features of liquid core  my searches don't turn up anything  an concat appears in shopfiy liquid lib liquid standardfilters rb  so doesn't appear to be an 'extension' in any way i can percieve 
thanks guys  but update theme is not working  i reinstall ruby 2 3 1 by using rbenv  then i jekyll new test   and jekyll serve   it works  it might be something wrong with my ruby 
ok i fix but now i have another error  jekyll 3 3 0   error  uninitialized constant bundler  plugin  api  source
the ruby package was selected on the cygwin installer  the version installed came with an older version of json  1 8 2   so i manually upgraded using  gem update   the above works fine when doing  jekyll serve   i see the error when performing  bundle exec jekyll serve  
i am not using rouge  i am using pygments as highlighter  i have found the problem inside the  highlight rb  file  https   github com jekyll jekyll blob master lib jekyll tags highlight rb#l108  i think the purpose of this line is to remove additional unwanted tags  but when using the table formatter for pygments removing all    pre   div   destroys the format  so i would confirm this as a jekyll bug   this  https   github com jekyll jekyll commit bf149a0b97187259cccb5323d3396f313b3461b0  is the commit that introduced  sub  to fix a problem with rouge  causing the problem with pygments  the trick is needed  as otherwise you have additional tags that can cause problems with the layout  now the author of the commit says but in this case this caused a problem  i think tag removal should be context aware in this case 
i am using the version 3 3 1  so do i have to create them  but i don't know how  this is the first time i use this   
 ashmaroli still you did not get my error    screenshot from 2017 01 06 15 54 09  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10773353 21715114 b4b498a0 d428 11e6 9e2c 3e2e12bafd76 png  i'm following this guide and want to install jekyll but at the end of command  i got an error  something i mention in bracket   done error  so please clear then you have something  
updated above  sorry about that  i had accidentally put the reproduction steps and output into annotations 
thanks for helping get to the bottom of this  to be clear  i don't personally have much need for a   dir  template variable  my issue was merely that   path 's behavior was different from what is described in the docs  and i wasn't sure which was “correct”  i will be submitting a pr for the docs instead  if that's peachy by you 
yes  i just quoted a part of the code  i'm running in version   _3 4 1_    thanks for answering    
 pathawks i except jekyll liquid can handle        correctly  no error  no warning  jekyll liquid complains about legal markdown containing         eg          title  blog post in markdown    
silly me  i always for get to update 
 crispgm i've attached my copy of the repo  ty       hyde master zip     
ok that 2012 is a tag  so liquid is seeing this tag as an integer  how to make sure liquid understand that it's a string  enclosing 2012 between quotes  i have already closed my laptop for the night  will try with the double quotes tomorrow morning  on sun  2 jul 2017 at 00 52 florian thomas  notifications github com  wrote     mailed on the go via my iphone 7 plus
i may be misunderstanding your question  but i believe you're asking whether the site builds correctly while    _layouts 404 html  is present  yes  the site builds correctly while    _layouts 404 html  is present  as long as the layout is not used by any page  the site builds correctly 
 baseurl  " news"   url  "https   example com"  the  baseurl  is being inserted where it should  the  url  is being ignored and replaced with  http   localhost 4000  as it should  then a     is being inserted before everything  noticed some discussion around githubpages which involved changing  baseurl  " "  to  baseurl  ""   perhaps some changes in there ended up breaking  relative_url   seems  relative_url  behaviour has changed from "convert this to a relative url" to "take a post path and throw a slash in front of it"  edit  only plugin is this one  doesn't seem to touch anything related to paths  https   github com mryellow jekyll feed json

ahh this is what i was looking for  probably a link at the top of the section like this  https   github com jekyll jekyll pull 6794
yes that works 👍 but off course not the most ideal solution   
hello   permalinks  pretty  was not included in the  _config yml  file that jekyll generated  i added it to  _config yml 
running with trace throws the exact same error  i can't know it's related to jekyll 4 for sure with the error thrown  however  1  it was working before using jekyll 4  and  2  there seem to be similar issues with established plugins popping up in gitter  but again it's hard to tell bc the errors are vague  i would be happy to share more info if i could 
no  removing any or all  slug  settings does not solve the issue 
wow  ok  well i would say that is a marketing problem not a coding problem  i've seen a lot of open source projects come and go and the ones that stick around have a core group of cheerleaders…updating docs  posting blog articles  regularly requesting community involvement and feedback  etc  all that to say  i think maybe a good place to start would be the jekyll blog  last post was from august last year  is that something i could help draft up 
right  sorry  i did a quick search but did not come across it  thanks    will pull a fresh copy from the repo

thanks  i checked and it seems to still work  probably the error was elsewhere previously 
certainly  i will put together a pr  in the vignette  would you prefer an annotation or aside or an inline word of caution about the problematic names 
sure  maybe you can give me a pointer to the type of dataset you need  i could tweek the meuse data by adding factor  posix     char column  is that the kind of file you need  
would this work       https   i imgur com 2e90nv4 png 
clauswilke  unfortunatly i already reinstalled the old version of ggplot2 on my machine so the issue is fixed  what i can say is try running any script that creates a standard ggplot2 chart from a file  and do so running via task scheduler   rscript exe  that is basically what i did and still go the same error  the issue was only about saving the plot calling ggsave  only from rscript exe i am on a windows 10 machine  hope that helps    library ggplot2  set seed 1234  df    data frame  sex factor rep c "f"  "m"   each 200    weight round c rnorm 200  mean 55  sd 5   rnorm 200  mean 65  sd 5      p   ggplot df  aes x weight   + geom_histogram   ggsave "c  mydirectory myfile png"  plot   p  width   5  height   5  units   "in"   
here is another example  building on claus' code  it seems that  color  and  fill  are not treated the same way by ggplot2  i found this surprising and unexpected    perhaps this is intended behavior     details 
sorry  jet   is this 
that's just fine    you don't control the internet  just clearly saying that it's out of date solves the problem for me  thanks 
i just never explored  geom_sf  and didn't realize  geom_map  was redundant     if geom_map is bound to be deprecated some of these remarks lose their relevance obviously  however i think the larger point remains  it seems to me that it is very intimidating to learn how to plot a simple map  fill a handful of countries or states with colors mapped to a value    geom_sf    is not an evocative name and learning that  sf  means "simple features" which can be point  lines or polygons  doesn't make it so obvious that we might want to use it to draw a world map  so i like  geom_map    because it's the function name i'd have typed naturally i if didn't know it existed  i feel that if i have a  df    data frame country   c "russia"  "china"   value   1 2   i should be able to use a one liner to draw the corresponding map and the fact that i couldn't answer the tweet linked above in 30 minutes  despite having worked with maps a bit in the past prompted this issue     i would have liked to do something like  ggplot df  aes region   country  fill   value   + geom_map map   "world"    scroll a document to find my prefered projection  and be done  on stack overflow i find these answers when looking for "plot world map"  https   stackoverflow com questions 9805895 mapping the world on ggplot2   5k views  uses  fortify    and  geom_polygon    https   stackoverflow com questions 11225343 how to create a world map in r with specific countries filled in 20k views  no ggplot answer
thanks  the dev version fixes the problem  any idea when will it be pushed to cran  this is breaking my ci tests 
no problem  thank you 
good question  i like that there is more than one way to create plots in ggplot2  in particular  i feel like one of the powers of the grammar of graphics is the ability to use "primitives"  lines  points  bars  etc   to construct plots  as examples     geom_freqpoly  is essentially a  geom_line  with  statbin   with  pad   true      geom_smooth  is a  geom_line  with  statsmooth  + a  geom_ribbon  with  statsmooth     geom_col  is a  geom_bar  with  statidentity     geom_count  is a  geom_point  with  statsum   and aesthetic  size  set to  stat n       geom_histogram  is a  geom_bar  with  statbin     geom_boxplot  is a combination of  geom_crossbar  +  geom_linerange  +  geom_point  i can see why these "non primitive" geoms   geom_freqpoly    geom_boxplot   etc  would be useful  in particular to have well known plot names that can be used and make things easier  and more readable   for users  i just really like the ability to construct them with primitive geoms as well  as for why i thought this might be a bug  i can understand why  binwidth  would be deprecated as an argument to  geom_bar   since that argument only really makes sense with  statbin   but the default stat is  statcount   in fact  current functionality overrides the specified stat  including the default  to  statbin  when  binwidth  is given as an argument to  geom_bar   the following reprex shows this    sup created on 2020 02 08 by the  reprex package  https   reprex tidyverse org   v0 3 0   sup  so  for any other stat besides  statbin   giving that warning that  binwidth  isn't an argument anymore to  geom_bar  makes sense   but it _does_ make sense when  statbin  is specified 
all i do is  install packages "ggplot2"   and i get the following rd warnings rd 16  file link 'as list environment' in package 'base' does not exist and so has been treated as a topic rd 51  file link 'extended_breaks' in package 'scales' does not exist and so has been treated as a topic rd 49  file link 'extended_breaks' in package 'scales' does not exist and so has been treated as a topic there are many more similar rd warnings 
yes  it does fix it  moreover  it worked fine when i used  grdevices  png     plots above were saved through "export   save as image   " in rstudio  it seems weird to me  that it works fine without facets  so i'm not sure if this is only a graphic device issue 
it looks like the file isn't double encoded on s3  but still doesn't resolve    lets see if i can get the markdown right today 
ahh yes that was it  i found a file in the initializers folder with these contents   i tried removing the styles line  but i get the same error message  removing this file entirely however solves the issue  i'll get with the person who originally wrote this code and try to find a better solution  thanks

should i keep the bad example in readme   i think it's counterproductive and keeping only the proper way is better  do you agree  
now when looking at the logs with fresh eyes it actually reveals what is happening  the first convert resizes the original image to 1x1 image  the later converts use that 1x1 image instead of the original to create 40x40  80x80 and 120x120 images  i think it should use the original image in all of the converts 
here is the trace   i am using this version because i have another error with the current version of paperclip  i don't remember which one but its related with são paulo s3 region of aws 
hi  by my side  the 3 0 2 version didn't fix the problem    
i have no clue what is trying to serialize the object  i don't have marshall or any other libraries that i explicitly use  either way changing the name to jobapplication worked 
awesome  i switched my gemfile to use  master  and it worked on my development machine  a pretty standard ubuntu box with rvm   the only thing i would like to see as an improvement is some sort of visual feedback  i only have 30 images in my test database and the task took several minutes which is understandable but it would be nice to see a visual indication that its working away rather than just stuck  image 1 done  image 2 done  image 3 done  etc    that sort of thing  the reason i think this is important is for users with a large number of images  we want to run this on our production image library which is 12gb+ of original images  natural this will take some time even with high speed servers  my guess is 12 36 hours  without visual feedback it will be tough to know how much longer the task will take or diagnose the problem if it gets stuck

from my testing paperclip 3 0 4 works with the latest version of aws sdk  1 8    and the latest version of paperclip doesn't  in order to use the latest version of paperclip i had to use aws sdk 1 5 0 or older 
https   gist github com anujbiyani 6641455 here it is  unedited  it's a bit messy  sorry  i can remove stuff that is completely unrelated to paperclip if you'd like  i opted to leave as much information in there as possible for now 
i was using ckeditor models widely in the application  now i use my own sti models   asset    assetfile  and  assetimage  and everything seems fine 
thanks jyurek  your comment pointed me in the right direction  i had a gem using paperclip that had a generator  the generator used an old paperclip format for the path in the model  updating that fixed the issue  thanks again  sorry to trouble 
hello  thank you for your reply  i solved the problem by adding the unicode gem  now everything works fine  great job you guys are doing with this gem 
thanks  i tried again on a clean rails app and did not have an issue  i then removed every gem from my existing rails app to see if the problem would go away  eventually i found that someone extended the array class with a to_s  which was the cause of the infinite loop 
hi  tute   from what i saw that commit is related only with mime types and not the issue i referred above    even so  i tried master and the problem persists  the memory use is a bit lower but even so it's about 30mb  in my "patch" is around 5mb   
while uploading  csv file  it is not a content type validation  same file working well with paperclip 4 2 1 
 tute looks like it does 
that's all that was output in the log that i was tailing  here's the config and the rest of the trace  https   gist github com willc0de4food 537890180ad642fa047b397543bb45a5 full test code is here  https   github com willc0de4food sthree    edit when i specify the paperclip beta in my gemfile  the error is resolved and the upload succeeds   gem 'paperclip'  '5 0 0 beta2' 
that would be a dirty hack and does not work in my case  i'm doing complex stuff with rewrite rules and vhosting     but thanks for the idea
is this image path consumed by an api  i really do not know if i can do it any other way  thank you very much in advance

nevermind  i did some debugging  removed a bunch of stuff  include carrierwave  and it is definitely not carrierwave's fault  i jumped to that conclusion too quickly when the problem first manifested 
i created an uploader with nothing in it and mounted it into an activerecord class  also empty   i then uploaded a file using a standard form and after that i called the  url  method of the uploader instance  i expected it to return the full url to the file  e g  http   example com files 1 png  but it only returned the path   files 1 png 
carrierwave  0 4 5  and json_pure  1 4 3  as gems  could be the json_pure perhaps 
i figured out what was going on  first you must return the image passed into manipulate   i don't believe that was documented  but it makes complete sense after writing some of my own imagemagick code  
happy to do it as a pull request  but for sanity  would something like this work  url escape url unescape  url   the unescaping  i think  would unescape an already escaped string  but  again  i think  would leave an unescaped string along  —p
i've tried  but still have some issues with some specs 
dangit  the trick was to change  not a rails issue at all  thanks though 
that's it  calling url returns path to the old image  which is not deleted  when it should point to the newly generated image  and it is created   so recreate_versions  is useless this way 
sorry about the late reply  i gave a look at this issue yesterday again… and it was working  i can't reproduce the bug anymore  i haven't changed something in the uploaders setup  nor mongoid  just let a week pass while working on other parts of my app… i can't reproduce the bug anymore  and don't have any failing test or more logs    sorry   thanks for the great work

copy paste the same code and change the filename  i know it is awful  but i could not just say  and then redefine filename  versions weren't found  i asked at stackoverflow but did not get an answer  so i started experimenting and at first the original issue of the thread seemed like a possible way 
just did it again  and this is the error i get  which is very similar to the one above  but a bit different  
well i tried  sinatra  base public_folder  and it also returns  nil  
okay  i'll give it a try  let's say we have two versions  small and thumb   and our cache directory is at  project_home  public uploads tmp now we upload file jpg  if move_to_cache is set to false  the following will happen  1  file jpg get uploaded to server  at some  var tmp localtion  2  file jpg is copied to  project_home  public uploads tmp file jpg 3  file jpg is copied to  project_home  public uploads tmp small_file jpg 4  file jpg is copied to  project_home  public uploads tmp thumb_file jpg 5  small_file jpg is resized to 200 limits 6  thumb_file jpg is resized to 50 limits 7  all files get copied to store  now consider the case where move_to_cache is set to true  replace "copied" with "moved" in the step above  notice that at step 3   project_home  public uploads tmp file jpg will no longer exist  because it was moved to small_file jpg  and thus step 4 will fail  because it looks for file jpg   hope that helps  you can run the test and see for yourself  i think the fix should be pretty straight forward  when the versions are initialized set move_to_cache to false  
sorry  i made a mistake in the initial question  i've updated the code above to be more clear 
hey guys  thanks so much for taking a look  your documentation does state any file object can be passes to store  but i'm mistakenly passing a string  so my inexperience of rails is to blame here  and in fact your documentation is quite clear  having said that  in the loosely typed world of ruby i feel carrierwave shouldn't fail silently  especially if its a type error

hi  thomasfedb  checking the box does not affect either the  changed   value of the parent  elf  or  image_changed   of the child  toy   i checked by going through the console and inspecting after i'd committed my changes to the form 
none  unfortunately  this feature is still iceboxed for us 
perhaps randomizing with a certain result set    say  books published within the last 20 years  or something  also  we still don't handle the "end" of a carousel very well  so i hesitate to limit it  but  how about a slightly larger limit  like 20 or 30  you're saying we can hide checked out stuff if you add the pagination limit then 
yes  the field for title variants is useful information for the reasons stated  these are edition specific  not at the work level  populating the field is not required

yes  same error     unicode  must be defined somewhere else by default  i just don't know where  command   c  openbabel build mingw32 make  j4  display   an idea could be whether to explicitely call  loadlibrarya  or convert  lib_name c_str    to a  lpcwstr  aka  const wchar_t    i tried the first option and the compilation succeeded  now  i can't be sure this won't give problems in the future  i guess not

ah  it seems 2 7 7 was released on the 15th  i'll pull it down  give it a try and post results  thanks 
ok  i have a reproducible test case now which causes a seg fault  not just a backtrace  the problem is that i have a large  200k  text file which has the messages which cause the crash  that would be difficult to put in a gist  i will email it to you  the crash does not happen on osx with libxml 2 7 6 but does happen on ubuntu hardy with 2 7 3  with 1 4 1 and 1 4 2  
hmm  okay  i'll check my code data set and see if i can replicate the issue with better documentation 
thanks tenderlove  i have sent it to the moderators on the google group  yes  i thought that was the issue but i got the same result after installing the apparent dependancies    libxml2   libxml2 dev   libxslt   libxslt dev
voila 
hmm  it doesn't seem to matter what xml document i use  here is a test file i created that triggers the crash when i try to parse    xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    root   test   name id '1' t1  name   loc http   example com  loc    test    root  i can parse this document fine using the same version of nokogiri in ruby 1 8 7
thank you  i shall test it as soon as i can  sorry for not providing a test file  the test case was so simple i didn't think it was necessary 
the reordering broke a number of tests on our end  beyond that  i don't think it has any effect 
hopefully by today  the gem is building from native extensions so there is no problem with dependencies but something tells me that the problem lies in the dependencies  dependencies here are about libxml2  libxslt1 1 and other things  gcry_check_version is related to libgcrypt library but i already have it installed 
i've installed libxxml2 version 2 7 8 via  brew install libxml2  and i've  tried to  re install nokogiri pointing out the new libxml2 via  but when i ask  nokogiri  v   i still see that it is using 2 7 3  i also tried using bundle config and re running bundle install  as documented in the wiki page about libxml2 being a jerk   what am i doing wrong  thanks  in advance  for the assistance  edit  ok  completely removing nokogiri and using the install steps on nokogiri org worked  2 7 8 does fix the issue  closing this  thanks

yes i do  i'm using this same code to successfully fetch the encoding from hundreds of documents  only this page fails 
if the initial string is not html  text   should then not return html  as you can see in the example it actually gives you   p text  p    but that p node never existed in the first place  so some kind of conversion from text to markup is being done  
unless you're using rvm or rbenv you'll always need a "sudo gem install"  otherwise  just try blowing stuff away   uninstalling so you start with as much of a clean slate as you can 
actualy it is not caused by ' 0a'  it's caused by encoding  invalidbytesequence  then the rest text is not parsed  " xc1" followed by " " on gbk  encoding  invalidbytesequenceerror

ok  sounds good  looked at the package and it is just the lib + package json  no cmdline interface script  so it would be just best to do the package from scratch and negotiate with clark to replace it as it holds this project name currently  we can probably start with another node package  which works  but does not seem to be maintained  https   github com rickeyski node beautifier issues
 evocateur  you're entitled to your opinion and i respect that  personally i've always disliked comma first style but throughout years  i've come to appreciate the ease of moving  taking out  commenting  deleting etc   and as  bitwiseman says   diffing  so i'm willing to leave this as an option and let the user do whatever he prefers  sometimes  its not in his hands and he has to go by already set standards  yeah  fugly but reality   bitwiseman  at any level of indent  2 or 4   i guess this is how it should look   i think this is also consistent with how some of sql editors  where comma first is more prevalent  do it  and while i'm not advocating promoting bad layouts  i guess there is always a fine line between being idiomatic and dogmatic  think crockford here   comma first may not be prevalent because many of the formatters don't support it  whatever may be their reason  you're more familiar with the state of affairs code wise so i perfectly agree your roi argument  nevertheless  i thought of asking so that we can get these things out in the open  have a quorum to discuss things and if there is demand from community  maybe you guys can rethink about it  p s  i spent a couple of hours trying to see if i can quickly spin off something and wasn't very successful  maybe i'll give it a shot some other time 
yeah sure   expected  and input    
to indent with tabs instead of spaces  well  actually    i did not think about replacing teh character    "indent_char"  " t"  "indent_size"  1  work too   
i think that can be a solution  although i not comfortable in this code base to decide anything  weaponize this payload isn't a problem i think  right now there is no return profit  really depends the way people use this project 
yes  in a   style   tag  i use the html css js prettify plugin with sublime text 3

parse fail   also  just realized i didn't say what version i'm on  this is with revision 2720f7952242e3e4b27092bc53e22c4c9d0ec9c2 from git 
sure  done  http   bugs ledger cli org show_bug cgi id 985
you're right  issue #546 fixes it  i confirmed by building from the 'next' branch and running that one  you're also right the homebrew formula uses the current release  which i think is on purpose  i'm not involved enough with homebrew development to know how they'd like to have the next alpha branch in their formula  or with ledger development to know whether or not your bug fix should be applied to the current stable 
for the moment i'm adding a final suite to verify the correct number of tests run  describe "end"  function      it "should have correct number of describe   blocks"  function      expect jasmine currentenv_ nextsuiteid_  toequal test totalsuites       it "should have correct number of it   blocks"  function      expect jasmine currentenv_ nextspecid_  toequal test totalspecs          
thank you  that does work  but htmlreporter piles all of the results from every call to it at the bottom of the report instead of within the test it was called from 
this is wrong  and entirely an artifact of some bizarre interactions in surrounding code  i sincerely apologize for taking your time 
yes  i believe you are right  sheelc  once you put some significant attributes in the backbone model the code which checks for object equality loops through all those attributes  i guess the easiest way to reproduce the problem is create a large number of attributes on the backbone model and try again  if i have a chance i will try to put together a test case  i'm fairly certain you will see this with anything that has lot of attributes on it  which really shouldn't effect the equality check 
thank you for the timely response  i did not know about custom equality testers  i think with those i can re create the pattern i need  also  in the example the tester is added in "beforeeach"  would it suffice to add it only once at startup 
i'm opening  specrunner html  in chrome 33 on windows 7  launched with    allow file access from files  so that  coffee script js  can load coffeescript tags   everything is copied exactly from  jasmine standalone 2 0 0 zip   except with  playerspec js  replaced by a  playerspec coffee  and the changes in the html shown above 
 infews i mean i have several specs linked in the  index html   like  onespec js    twospec js   i also linked  jasmine js    jasmine html js    boot js    jasmine css  which i copied from  jasmine standalone 2 0 0   as we know  once i open the  index html   it will run all these specs automatically  but i don't want to run these specs once  and i don't want to separate these specs into different htmls  i hope i can accomplish this  when i press  run onespec  button in the  index html   i can do something like this   pre  code  var oneenv   jasmine getenv 'onespec'   oneenv execute      code   pre  and when i press  run twospec  button in the  index html   i can do something like this   pre  code  var twoenv   jasmine getenv 'twospec'   twoenv execute      code   pre  is that possible  or did i misunderstand about jasmine 
well for example i've thought throu what test will be needed  but haven't implemented yet  but after some time one can forget about what is done and what is not and when running test one might see  that everything is okay without knowing  that there is no actual test done  maybe at least tests could add some prefix to test description at runtime saying  that everything is okay as they do now  but also saying something like
evidently not unfortunately 
not able to reproduce now  will reopen the issue if see that happening again  sorry about that 
makes sense  thank you for taking the time to find out 
my apologies  i've tested this and confirmed that two tests with the same name do run  i was running my tests using karma with the  karma mocha reporter  plugin  it looks like the _reporter_ was just not _listing_ both of the tests  interestingly  this happened in another reporter   karma spec reporter   too  so either it's a karma bug or a common design error 
to me it looks like jasmine is doing some simple parsing on the errors  and it's a bug in this parsing  in the first example  i would expect to see something like this   note that this is exactly what jasmine outputs now  just in different order  and in the second example  i would expect to see an error message like  expected spy unknown to have been called with   'b'  any   es6 promise promise  promise     constructors are functions  and it doesn't make sense to put the whole function in the error report   name would be enough  this affects only  jasmine any   i believe  
thanks for the update  i see why it's happening now  if you're interested  when i attempt to log in with my github credentials it produces the following error  authentication failed insufficient data from authentication provider  name not provided or empty
the patch also adds a username parameter to e g  eapleap_stage4    what i would like to have would be a way to log challenge  response  username as '_username_  netntlm _challenge_ _response_' to make it easy to run it through john the ripper 
umm  still having problems  does not seem to be   exactly   the same   in case it helps  i'm sending a saml assertion ukerna vendor specific attribute  the contents you see in #6 do not look like what i sent  some errors in the string  such as paml instead of saml  i guess memory is getting corrupted 
thanks  i'll try to reproduce it in a test environment tomorrow  and try the new version there  dnia 22 marca 2016 19 20 09 cet  alan dekok notifications github com napisał a   ## wysłane za pomocą k 9 mail

it seems to be a problem with python 2 6  i download the latest web2py zip  unzipped it and tried following with my python 2 6 9  on linux mint    it seems to be an issue with python 2 6 x  independent from any ldap configuration 
there is no traceback  only this line  traceback  most recent call last   and the thread stuck   never returns  like recursion issue  i tried to add   copy   method to table class in dal pydal objects py   and this problem is gone  just for testing 
after reading issue #1706  i decided to remove the gluon directory on my server and replace it with the latest  and it appears the errors are gone  looks like the upgrade got a bit messed up  problem solved 
the is_unicode parameter seems redundant  you have check if the value is unicode  so why you need is_unicode again  why not fully deprecate it  my test case will crash the program if i am unware of is_unicode 
indeed  i didn't do db commit   thanks 
i unzipped the source over my installation  how must i go about to update appadmin

hi  i updated neo4j to 3 0 8  we use enterprise edition 
jruby 1 6 6 gems neo4j 1 3 1 java
sure i'll have a look
it's not the problem since the last release  since there is no need to execute the neo4j jars command  
mea culpa  it seems that app restart helped 
bundler is not able to bundle straight from your repo because it says that your gemspec is bad  i guess i am requesting for you to you support bundling direct from your repo  if that's not possible  i will wait for your next release which seems to fix problems with  accepts_hash_for   i have a workaround which is to always provide a block 
ooops  my fault   do you think we could use a similar approach to solve the load fixtures question     issue #611 
rails 4 0 3 neo4j 3 0 0 alpha 3 jruby 1 7 9
two questions in fact  i  in the neo4j core  we do index labels like below  does this apply to rails usage as well  or rails version does some kind of an auto index to labels 
i think it depends on the context  a "drawing canvas" containing new geometric elements  canvas  contains   element  needs an update on the "canvas"  but  say a "blog post" having new comments  post has  comment  does not need an update on the "post"  maybe it should be an option  where creating or deleting a relation or changing an existing relation's property is an update to its  start_node  and  end_node  
this is a new piece code     but getting the same error with 3e386d50dedc8a5704c1247e7a77b0ac0242757f from sep 6   
thanks for the quick feedback  i assumed that ar 4 1 7 worked in rails and i was having problems because i'm using sinatra  somehow  when i add the neo4j gem  my app loses track of the environment variable  here's my gemfile lock 
actually  yes  as a new user of the api i was expecting where and rel_where to accept the same parameter changing only their underlying context node and relationship  respectively   i think rel_like would be a better name here because what you are sending as parameter is an example of what you expect
yes  it can wait  i was planning to work on a feature i'm building using active job sometime early next week 
hey brian  cannot reproduce without reverting applied migrations  but will keep looking at similar classes  with those type of names   be aware that using inflections  or not  is also impacting on this 
yes i included the concern after the neo4j  activenode  but anyway  thanks to  subvertallchris  you solution worked perfectly   y 
hi brain  the returning method works with the count as strength  which orders the highest correlating users  but i'm having troubling accessing the enumerable after the return  trying to figure the best way to deal with the problem  most likely some kind of map method from neo4j core  on tue  jul 14  2015 at 12 51 pm  brian underwood notifications github com wrote 
i would suggest to follow ruby's principle of least surprise  or at least to document the fact that something does not work as one may expect  as it happens in this issue  
i spoke with _someone_ about it on gitter but i can't recall with who at this point  if this was a neo4j quirk however  i would like to see neo4j rb handle it more gracefully than unexpected behavior  from the user's perspective  
ok  i'v changed the version  i've tested more versions before posting and forget to change back   i've changed the config neo4j session_path to 'http   localhost 7474' instead the local ip and now it works  thanks for the quick response 
here's the class definition   there's no custom  to_json    i did play with it a little to massage the data  but quickly switched to creating a custom method to return json 
yes  that was the problem  in the hanami framework  hanami  entity  redefines attributes  not including  hanami  entity  fixed the problem  upon further notice i realise that i should not have even included  neo4j  activenode  in the  entity  class rather it should be in the  repository  class based on hanami architecture of things  should i close this issue 
sorry about that one typing in the wrong window  please ignore  on 06 05 16 19 02  brian underwood wrote 
this is just a regular   find params  id     i am explicitly using transactions elsewhere  but i ensure that these are closed
it makes perfect sense  thanks for taking the time to explain  i also see your conundrum  in order to print a warning  you would effectively have to respond to the idea that the gem is being run in a rails project  which creates an explicit coupling to rails  i suppose you could print such a warning whenever a command is forwarded to neo4j rake_tasks   but i suppose the most reasonable way to deal with this would be to just put a line somewhere in the docs 
sure  let me have a go

hi justin  thanks for your quick response and troubleshooting  i did see a comment in one of the discussion groups that the ckeditor  which i am using  might be related to this kind of problem  in any case  i will try some your suggestions and see if we can nail it down  regards  david

hi justin  i am using a nginx proxy behind apache running dadamail with fastcgi  nginx adds the real_ip header  because remote_addr is the ip of the proxy   this are the environment parameter  and in my concent logs i always get the  remote_addr  instead of the  real_ip

i have seen the issue on android 4 1 1 but only on certain devices  specifically samsung skinned devices   i have attempted to reproduce this problem on other android 4 1 1 devices but have not seen it  why this problem only appears to happen on certain samsung devices is a mystery  i was able to track down the problem to  line 72 of transition native js  https   github com yui yui3 blob master src transition js transition native js#l72  where it attempts to determine if it should use a vendor specific css prefix by checking for 'transition' in the document style  in the case of the problem devices it guesses it does not need to use a vendor prefix  because  'transition' in document document_element  style  evaluated to true  however later on down in the code in the _runnative method on  line 324  https   github com yui yui3 blob master src transition js transition native js#l324  it filters out properties that are not in the node style member  so what happens on these devices is that it tries to use css properties like 'tranisiton duration' and 'transition delay' but those properties are not available

i would expect the result to be the equivalent of nodelist gethtml   tostring  
yeah i'm going to have to rename the attribute  i just found the behavior a bit confusing because when i think of a list i assume it will allow duplicates  but in this case it's behaving more like an ordered set 
yeah  i'll do that  give me a little bit to set that up  what do you think about it for the other components  though 
thanks for the fast response  who is supposed to close this bug

ryuichi  the reason to allow for “no”t setting the env parameter is for performance reasons  when the ‘env’ parameter is set  yql will do a backend http request  so the default is to hit ‘datatables org’ for all requests  in my case  none of my tables are part of datatables org  i don’t need that backend request  brock davis 404 345 3440 yid  brocktriplets from  ryuichi okumura  mailto notifications github com  sent  tuesday  december 31  2013 2 56 am to  yui yui3 cc  brock davis subject  re   yui3  yql request defaults env parameter to open tables  no easy way to turn off   #1509  ah  i understand now  yql module set env parameter to the community tables at datatables org as default indeed  i think it's basically works fine  why do you want to turn off the env parameter  — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com yui yui3 issues 1509#issuecomment 31386945

i'm using the newest stable version of firefox   29 0 1 and yui3 3 16 0  here's the piece of code i'm using in my app  it works everywhere except firefox    in the  initializer   of appview  i'm not able to do anything with the promise named  template  by using   then    method  i tried to debug the  promise js  module of yui3 and i found that function stops executing in  try     catch  block without any error  as i mentioned above 
 okuryu  thank you for the response  i'll file an issue on the correct repository 
i found the bug last night   it's in active record  i can fix it there  but rails3 has totally refactored how this works so i'm not sure if it's worth submiting it  does it make sense to try to retro fix ts to work reliably with 2 3 5 
the "rescue" does not work within my application  too  here is a simplified snippet of code   despite the "rescue" the exception is raised  btw  the option "ignore_errors" is working fine  but i want to catch errors by myself  my environment    ruby 1 8 7  2010 12 23 patchlevel 330   i686 darwin10    rails 2 3 10   sphinx 0 9 9 release  r2117    thinkingsphinx 1 4 1
i am using globalize3  https   github com svenfuchs globalize3  i took a quick look through their source and i didn't see update_index being defined  and i am not redefining update_index 
doesn't work either  but 'ico' should also work  at least it does on the old system without rt indexes 
hi pat  i tried to use absolut paths  but i cannot get "out" from inside the deployed release  it's in a docker container   absolut paths inside that container are only absolute to the container itself  so from inside  folders on the host are not accessible  unless going through a shared folder  but that shared folder's path is different from inside the container than when seen from the host  when i use option 2  running sphinx from inside the deployed container  and i try to start searchd from within the release directly  like you suggest  i get this 
ah  right you are  pat  while the problem only became manifest in 2 0 5  it looks like it could more rightly be attributed to the awesomeprint gem that we are using in rails console  specifically  it's being caused by the "irb integration" part of the awesome_print install  https   github com michaeldv awesome_print taking that out of  irbrc fixes it  something about the "ap  context last_value" on the result of a sphinx search doesn't work quite right 
hello  i was wrong  problem is not in ts  it is in ts delayed delta  when i save my model on every save tsdd add job to index delta even if i just do "post last save"  post changed in this situation return false 
yes  that looks like it will work  thanks 
its rake ts index
works with  datetime   so now the only error i get is   so is there any special way of handling excerpts in thinkingsphinx 3  
this is the first line of my app indices user_index rb  but for the moment  i didn't setup any solution to "treat" the delta indexes 
hi pat  i had run ts rebuild  but doing it again produces an error  error  index 'site_core'  sql_range_query  error  function array_agg   does not exist line 1     al_class"  0 as "sphinx_deleted"  array_to_string array_agg       hint  no function matches the given name and argument types  you might need to add explicit type casts   dsn pgsql   postgres     localhost 5432 ppe_development   which is a bit odd because it's a perfectly valid postgres function  could this be to do with the fact that it's interfacing to searchd as mysql 
if i just do  school query 'foo'   it would return results that can be paginated etc 
thank you for the quick reply  problem is solved now  actually i was not change the address in the sphinx yml  now in cofing development sphinx conf and config sphinx conf are same address 
i currently have  gem 'mysql2' gem 'thinking sphinx'
that's a good point about not needing to restart on every deploy  i hadn't though of that  i think i put it in originally so i wouldn't have to remember to restart as when i did in fact change the index definitions or configuration  i may well take it out as far as i can tell  the previous searchd process doesn't get killed properly  here's a snippet from the log   i'm going to do a quick deploy now to verify this   
  service_index rb  
yeah  similarly to mysql2 parameters  that does sound better  abstracting away the peculiarities of sphinx config  i almost went this way at first  but it required too much monkey patching  and i had to get things running here  plus i didn't know where you'd want things to head to 
good call  thanks    on sep 11  2014  at 10 26 pm  pat allan notifications github com wrote 
the thinking sphinx version that i've previously used is 2 0 14 the sphinx version that i use right now is sphinx 2 0 4 id64 release  r3135 
yes i use standard destroy  footage destroy
yeah  i've tried  bundle update joiner   no change  we're on  0 3 4   the index is on the content model  content  has_and_belongs_to_many  locations  and  belongs_to  organization   organization _also_  has_and_belongs_to_many  locations   i'll try to generate an app from scratch and see if i can duplicate the issue outside our app 
thanks for the reply  i'm putting a load balancer in front of multiple machines serving the same rails app  the app uses real time indexing and employs ts for filtering and search from the app's index pages  ideally the configuration would follow the distributed model provided by sphinx  http   sphinxsearch com docs current distributed html what other info can i provide that you would find helpful  thanks 
hi pat  thanks for the tip on  min_infix_len   i've also enabled the  expand_keywords  option  as described  here  http   sphinxsearch com docs current html#conf expand keywords    it wouldn't fix my issue  but seems nice to have   my config thinking_sphinx yml file now looks like this   neither wildcard search nor substring search are working  even though the sql surrounds each space separated search string with     characters  i've also tried activating  enable_star  and  min_infix_len  without  expand_keywords   i'm still able to match individual complete words  or consecutive and non consecutive sets of complete words  but i can't match partial words  with or without wildcards  any other tips you have would be greatly appreciated  thanks 
i found the problem  putting  ngram_chars  in the config file causes this problem  and it was unnecessary for indexing "arabic  persian and urdu"  setting the right  charset_table  does the trick i e    charset_table  0  9  a  z  _  a  z  a  z  u+621  u+63a  u+640  u+64a u+66e  u+66f  u+671  u+6d3  u+6d5  u+6e5  u+6e6  u+6ee  u+6ef  u+6fa  u+6fc  u+6ff 
sometimes once every few days  sometimes more  i didn't notice any exact periodicity  sphinx  3 0 3 mysql  i don't have access to the server now  so i don't know the mysql version  thinking sphinx  4 0 i got a call from a customer describing a problem  a few hours later he said that the site was already working  this means that the connection was first lost  and then appeared  i looked at the cron and saw there the periodic re indexation  it is possible that reindexing somehow restarted sphinx  or thinking sphinx 
yes  i was just going to look at this  get the stack trace and also see if i could write a failing spec for it as well  i'll comment with more soon

in this example i have project has_many tasks and a lot of unassigned tasks  i'd like to enter id's of tasks  that may be found for example with autocomplete  and submit to application  currently it's submitting as string  is there any way to submit as array 
i'm running justinfrench formtastic  0 2 4

never written any     i'll definitely add asap  can you point me to a good primer 
i use rails 2 3 5 and formtastic 0 9 7  best regards  boris
running tests on latest are passing  i submitted a pull request 
it is true  i was calling "form semantic_fields_for  user company do  company "  when it should have been "form semantic_fields_for  company do  company "  sorry  this issue can be closed 
sorry  forgot to mention  rails 3 0 0 beta4 + formtastic 1 0 0 beta
yes  my bad  was not in the rails3 branch  also i remember checking out the 1 0 0 rc tag  which i thought was about the rails3  one more unrelated issue  while on rails3 branch i get these warnings   does not happen on the master branch 
i believe it may have been a bundler caching error  so i'm closing this  thanks for the follow up  originally  when i attempted to update to rails 3 0 0 from 3 0 0 rc  bundler claimed formtastic still required 3 0 0 rc  so i pointed the gemfile to formtastic's git master  problem solved  i just pointed the gemfile back to 1 1 0 beta  and the error is gone  i'll take it up with the bundler team  thanks
interesting  in my environment  and heroku's  the 1 1 0 gem and rails 2 3 8 causes the hidden_fields statement to be escaped and therefore it appears on the screens  under 2 3 8 you have to force formtastic to bind to 2 3 8 rather than 3 0 0   at least in my case  i call the formtastic method this way   78  as     check_boxes  79  label    false  80  label_method     name  81 # value_method     description  82 # collection     group id   83  input_html      style    "width 20 "  84     groups is a habtm relationship
thanks so much for the feedback  justin  my app still works fine if i install activesupport 3 0 2 manually before formtastic  so will do that for now  just one more reason to move to bundler asap  my personal feeling  as someone who has contributed nothing more than a small bugfix to formtastic  is that  since it's a rails specific library  removing the activesupport dependency probably isn't such a bad solution for now  edit  just saw that the readme does state that bundler should be used 
i'm not sure what you mean  running  rake  should yield a failing spec 
it's a semanticformbuilder  creates in this partial   the code i posted initially is the body of _link_to_add_fields_
https   gist github com 806227
i did a fresh install of formtastic  using bundler  my gemfile entry reads  gem 'formtastic'  '   1 2 0' bundler cannot find the repository for v2 0 0 when using the gemfile entry  gem 'formtastic'  '   2 0 0'
okay  i'll keep my quick and dirty fix on my working copy  thanx to both of you for your prompt answers 
there are no commits since 2 0 0 rc4  https   github com justinfrench formtastic compare 2 0 0 rc4   master
here is the generated minimal html  https   gist github com cedb5ed4e41bada82fe2  just add the formtastic css to the directory  and the erb that generates it  https   gist github com 7f164d29916e443481c9 the custom input is here  at line 71   https   gist github com 1030551 firefox 4  safari  chrome 12
yes  i have restarted server etc  the problem is still there  i'm using rails 3 0 3 and formtastic 1 2 4
formtastic 2 0 0 rc3 indeed resolves the issue for me  i was doing some custom wizardry to allow a date picker field type  which does not work "out of the box" with 2 0 0 rc3  so i'll have to tackle that before upgrading  thank you for the quick response and resolution  and for working on such a useful library  
i made the spec  but i didn't send a push request because it passes  https   github com taavo formtastic commit 8ab6b3f26b8cedce774a4470bccb127f055d4e02   my live code  unfortunately  continues to fail  for the record  i get the same behavior when the code is simplified to the following  and it behaves the same whether user status is a string or a boolean    i just created a fresh out of the box 3 0 9 project for testing  and got the same behavior  3 0 10 and 3 1 0  works correctly    seems like it could be easier to update to 3 0 10 than troubleshoot this 
at the moment i was just looking at an ugly       f input  born_at   as     string   label    "date of birth"   input_html       value    f object born_at strftime " d  m  y"      wrapper_html       class    "date"       i'm all up for other options of course  and versions of formtastic   i'm currently on 1 2 4 i thought about creating another input type to do what i'm after but i found the code a little over whelming  oops 
"studies show that those side by side inputs  as opposed to a nice uniform series of labels and widgets  actually perform way worse in user testing " you are operating on outdated info there  or you aren't thinking of specific cases where it makes sense  like with an expiration date  credit card numbers and security codes  for too general of an accusation to make  either way it seems like  wrapper_html    false is a logical feature but we basically went with your #2 response before reading this  thanks for the response 
nice  it works   small correction  post  copy  has to be  post   copy 
hey justinfrench  the version where that was working was the 1 2 4  
 justinfrench yes i guess most people just don't display these readonly fields in edit form  my use case is mostly through activeadmin  thanks for taking time to explain and good luck fighting magic   
simple  i wanted to access form element  i wanted to append some html to it  so needed handle to it  though i had single form on the page  wanted to have a clear way to select it  so found  namespace would assign id _ namespace  to it  but not found working  i ended up using   "form formtastic" 
i tried locally and it works as expected    i think the same must be fixed for  time_picker  and  datetime_picker   if you need more help with writing failing specs or something  i will be glad  just let me until next week  now i'm in a work storm    
sorry  justinfrench  had some connectivity issues before being able to fil the issue body 
thank you for answer  i've made update in so post  so the part of problem solved  but anyway  i did not found any mansion about polymorphic associations  so i spent all day for digging  you may use my so post as a template  i will be pleased is it useful   
in this case  a list of string input and a "add more" button to add an empty input to add more tags  i'm not looking to add relation datas or datas that already exists on db 
hello  i use raphael 1 5 2  i have fixed the problem  raphael el destroy   function     this node raphael   null  if this paper top    this paper top next   null    this paper top   null  this paper bottom   null  this prev   null  this paper   null  this group   null  this 0    null  this node   null     this function removes circular references between objects  memory leak was through this   this node raphael 
ok  i understand  out of curiosity though  is there a reason why svg patterns are not supported as a fill in raphaël  i was under the impression that it could be done by svg specs  as for whether it is supported in ie6  i do not have ie on my system to test it  sorry 
i try to explain better   i not speak english very well   in my application is use raphael library and raphalel freetransform whit raphael i visualize the image and text  for example when i draw an image with paper image src  x  y  width  height  where src is a fisycal path in my file system in explorer the image is visualized well  in chrome  i see all white and when i click in the space where the image should be inserted i see only the raphael freetransform  for text  instead  if i use paper text   and associate to it attributes  font weight and font style  in explorer work only font family and font size but any value for font weight or font style not work  in chrome instead work  still  in explorer with raphael freetransform  i can move the object any object  text  image  with chrome raphael freetransform does nothing  thanks
 lazurowy the background    funny  try white http   jsfiddle net begm9 1 
version is 4 1 1  i try send simple mail but it take a while process before sent 
no  the smtp server handles the splitting 
yes it does  i tried to run  composer update  thinking that it will fetch the latest commit of the swiftmailer repository but it didn't  nevermind  this is fixed with this commit  thanks 
i'm so sorry  i had two projects one in sf 2 0 and another in 2 1  i made a mistake about the file that i have to change   
what do you mean by this  i didn't get you
hi fabian  i have tracked down the issue  and it's not your framework's fault  really sorry  this is a  known  bug from godaddy com  is seems  a lot of issues we had with their hosting services and this just adds to the list  and again  although the issue was reported for long time ago  they didn't fix it      i've found this by trying the test script prepared for you on another hosting service as well  and there's ok     here are some related links about this on godaddy  http   support godaddy com groups web hosting forum topic wrong return path added to outgoing emails 1  http   forums phplist com viewtopic php f 24 t 38416 i've convinced my client to cancel their services and move to a more professional hosting  you can close   delete this one   thanks 
hey fabien  yes  errors appear when my server has php setting  _disable_functions_ "show_source  system  shell_exec  passthru  exec  popen   proc_open   allow_url_fopen" laravel and swiftmailer are not checking for missing functions and i get the mentioned error message for  pipes  so  after defining pipes  i was getting down to a deeper problem  what happened was that i could not send out emails on staging environment  and was very hard to work out the cause  i have given up and now just using mail       ps  i'd like to know why popen and proc_open would be disabled  security reasons i know  but why would swiftmailer require them if it's problematic and opens up the server to security issues  then    is there a way to temporarily enable these things while an email is being sent  would be good to get ideas from people with better understanding of linux servers  php  mail and security    note  currently on a _shared server _   chris on 12 april 2014 18 12  fabien potencier notifications github com wrote 
 sstok that work really well  now i have to figure it out how to use it on symfony with the mail queue   thanks a lot

 xabbuh composer json  this is the minimal code needed to reproduce the issue  i think now that the issue is related to deepcopy  and not swiftmailer 
swift_transportexception  expected response code 250 but got code "421"  too many messages 
i went to the website and wondered  "hey  this looks like sinatra"  so my initial question was whether it was a coincident  which it apparently wasn't  i then wondered how much it differs  and was hoping to find some statement on the site somewhere  also  give blake some credit by mentioning sinatra  it won't cost you devs  since ppl would use it in the first place due to perl   i mean  the basic api of  mojolicious  lite  is an exact copy of the sinatra api  plus all the websocket api  you could point that out as an advantage over sinatra  btw   but if you don't feel like it  ok 
all things being equal  probably not  but  every_param  appears to have been added to compensate for  param  no longer returning a list  providing alternatives for everything but  defaulthelpers  param    makes   could make a big breaking change more difficult to deal with when upgrading 
no idea  but it's clear current behaviour break things at least for very usual values in href attribute  and conflicts with at least one spec  am i should dig whatwg spec too for some reason 
d'oh you are right  there was a call into  self  app in startup indeed  looks like that was no problem before  so error on our side  thanks for the hint

it's not a huge issue  it just seems a tad unsanitary to have debug artefacts publicly exposed in my prod environment  it's a bit of a lurking corner case  i could very well just ask nginx to not proxy requests to  mojo to the app at all  but it seems like an unneeded layer of complication for every deployment to include  since i'd need a different config for nginx in prod dev   for those who are into jquery and are using it as part of their app  perhaps at a newer version there's now this goofy case where there are 2 versions of jquery on the site  which could be enough to allow bad guys some kind of foot hold  say an xss that loads the older one to get back an old jquery bug   would y'all be open to a pull request that "fixes" this with a similar mode switch to the one logging uses 
yeah  if the convention is to use " " and not "_"  then i agree that it doesn't make sense  i tried to find if there was a standard consistent way via googling  but i didn't find a consensus  i have two use cases i've done this for now  one was using "_" in urls for a site where that was already the delimiter and i wanted to keep the urls the same  the other was to create a valid subroutine name from a string for a mojolicious helper  which to be fair isn't really 'slugify' ing since it's not meant for a url 
ha  you're right  that's my mistake  it looks like those would be the same  i'll go ahead and close  thanks 
i use the following to benchmark  time  hires  time  vs  core  time   and although t  hr  time is  3 times slower  it still runs at  14e6 s    70ns per call  vs  25ns  on my computer 
thanks for the heads up  tried again with mojolicious 8 12  results unchanged 
even with just one promise  it's the same result  given this  #  usr bin env perl use strict  use mojo  promise  use mojo  useragent  my  ua   mojo  useragent  new  my  request_p    ua  get_p  'https   perlcon eu '    then  sub   print shift  res  code   " n"       mojo  promise  all  request_p   wait    but when using subprocess  #  usr bin env perl use strict  use mojo  promise  use mojo  ioloop  subprocess  use mojo  useragent  my  subprocess   mojo  ioloop  subprocess  new   subprocess  run  sub   my  subprocess   shift  my  ua   mojo  useragent  new  my  request_p    ua  get_p  'https   perlcon eu '    then  sub   print shift  res  code   " n"       mojo  promise  all  request_p   wait    # stdout show 200 code return 1     sub   print "done  n"        subprocess  ioloop  start unless  subprocess  ioloop  is_running 
my plan was to factor out the important bit of  json_has  and reuse that to decide whether to spit out an alternative message 
i created a sample app with a test to demonstrate this problem  http   nragaz com rest example zip the gemfile is simple   again  setting up the initializer manually in config environments test rb works 
#95 satisfies my use cases 
i looked further into this issue and it has nothing to do with factory girl  ruby 1 9 chokes on non ascii characters by definition  i overcome this by putting  # encoding  utf 8 as the first line of every file that had non ascii characters 
last time i tried that it throwed an exception  so i did not tried it again  today it works    so this issue is not longer necessary   
hi joshua  that actually was a good tip  the error has nothing to do with factory girl  and i should have taken the advice to heart  to look if i can instantiate the object via console before filing an issue  it actually has been a misconfiguration in the mongoid mappings   sorry for bothering    cheers stefan
ah  well  i much prefer the machinist syntax  it's shorter and easier to remember what model you're actually making  with the regular factorygirl syntax  i end up with factories labeled   this_or_that_kind_of_user  instead of just  user make  some_variant   and the namespace doesn't get polluted if i want a  user make  admin  and an  address make  admin   much cleaner  i think  though i think these things could be maintained by non core factorygirl people  it'd probably turn out better if the core group maintained them since they're already deeply immersed in the codebase and will be more likely to be aware of any potential issues 
the whole hierarchy is kinda really big  but here's the  user_factory rb  https   gist github com 2403193   let me know if you need more info 
it works fine when i'm using basic model interaction but we'd like to use factorygirl    and i checked test log and there is no inserts made into the table 
thanks  i just used "bundle update"  what should i use instead of "factory"  i am so confused by docs for fg4 and old ones    
in a large project context setup is the most complicated part and it is always flipped no matter how you define it  in general  i feel like this feature gives additional flexibility to generate data with factorygirl  which is its main goal  i don't want factorygirl to decide how should i generate my context  it's my job  just want a flexible tool to do it  ### live examples  https   gist github com 5795005 https   gist github com 5795040 ### simplified version of live examples  that is too complex to show real code i am doing things from your code example about 3 times a day  in a team of 5 people it is 15 times a day average  let's take the following association chain 
thanks 
 joshuaclayton tell me what data you want   are you talking about the error   i didn't get you 
 djcp i tried that  the error persists 
thanks  i think i was over thinking it  i thought i'd need to somehow get spec factories exposed to the gem's consumer  your comment makes sense 
thank you for your response  its working now  that was probably the problem i was fiddling around with rails_helper and spec_helper  my apologies 
 joshuaclayton only one factory file in the project  this is the full output in the terminal  is that the backtrace  sorry noob here  
no  it doesn't 
it worked for my specific project  but the project uses a bunch of custom plugins  all of which would have to be updated individually  since those plugins are used by numerous products  it's not a small undertaking to modify them and make sure all products are working properly thereafter  we just went through the upgrade process from factorygirl to factorybot  and it took multiple people several days to get everything through the process  it's something we're loathe to repeat so soon 
thanks y'all 
hi  i compiled ruby from source into  programs ruby 1 9 3p194 but now that you mention that  i think that was the problem  the array rb file contained my modifications i used in ruby 1 8 7 and now that i am on 1 9 3  some things don't need to be used as is there anymore  i even defined a to_hash method there  which was the culprit     i changed that and now prawn suddenly works fine  the  pdf example was also generated  sorry for the bother     i will close this issue now 
yeah i did  maybe wait with the merge till the errors are fixed  i got a long train ride saturday  i can take a look at them during the trip if you want 
this an example of it  http   hammackj com downloads graphs pdf i wasn't aware that xpdf was unmaintained  the pdfs look great in preview evince chrome  i just got a complaint that they didn't work in xpdf and wasn't sure why

 bradediger i'm working on a crude bisect to narrow down the commit  but i'm having to restart rails between each checkout  i'll get back to you     both images use  pdf image   but the logo is a path where as the the map is using  open    with a url  which afaik should be returning an io object 
if its a documentation bug  not a big deal as long as documentation gets updated    i worked around it by creating a separate font family to handle these weird cases  i'll craft a more specific failing example test script as soon as i get a chance  thanks 
pdf   prawn  document new pdf text "hello général world" mb_chars upcase pdf render_file "hello pdf"
i would extract acroform attributes of pdf form to fill with text or image 
thanks for information  to the best of my knowledge  the font is part of the issue  if i do not specify one  the issue does not occur   i also did my best to create an asciidoctor mwe  it is also astonishing to me that the printed text in the following mwe is so significant for the occurence of the error  my ruby skills are too elementary to isolate prawn from asciidoctor here  1  download  mwe zip  https   github com prawnpdf prawn files 462833 mwe zip  2  install the gem bundle 3  run  bundle exec rake book build 2  1   grep "incompatible encoding regexp"   if you see some output  you reproduced my problem  i would love to hear from someone capable of reproducing my problem  grinning 
i have to change the document creation due to private data that i can not publish here on github  this takes some time  in advance i can give you this prawn   prawn  https   user images githubusercontent com 578661 38777254 1dc66370 40a5 11e8 9a5b e670c9e99e82 png  tcpdf   tcpdf  https   user images githubusercontent com 578661 38777255 1ddf09e8 40a5 11e8 8aa3 f42255301851 png 
thanks  pointlessone for your response  sorry for stupid question  but how can i confirm that ligatures is lacking  generally in the text editors or word processors  the combination happens automatically  for eg  from the above example  first letter  to get  ပြည်   there sequence goes like  ပ ြ ည ်  and the word processors automatically adjusts them  1  ပ    ပ 2  ပ + ြ    ပြ 3  ပြ + ည    ပြည 4  ပြည + ်    ပြည် regards  mohan
hi  thanks for fast reply  i still see the flickering in the following situations    removing the second  screen  object from the config's  screens  list  keeping the second monitor connected   disconnecting the second monitor   xrandr  command showing only one monitor   with one  screen  object  that is  i haven't seen non flickering chrome in qtile 
i did some testing  and the sleep line did seem to make for a great work around  but just as i was writing this comment  the issue reoccurred  here's a screenshot    screenie  https   raw github com gist 3775670 b7b2bbd27ffbc5c87838b02b7b708f94b45f7206 textbox 20redraw 20error png 
yes  thanks a heap 
as a variant  yes  this code is suitable  but i still hope to find solution which uses no external tools  only default x environment  
here's my config https   bitbucket org jagguli qtile_config src 2bd949efc017 at master no idea why thats being set  i've worked around it by creating set_group hooks  might be a change in conkeror 
here's the output of  xprop  on the  wkline  window 
the current one is  exec qtile since i'm new to this project  i'd like to know the difference between qtile and qtile session    i'm going to package it into fedora  i need to understand something won't confuse people     thanks 
sorry    the code the show    i meant mod+mouse or mod+enter
on my system two of the  so filenames are slightly different so i'm using  libpango and libpangocairo should have been installed through apt  i used  dpkg  l libpango 1 0 0 amd64  and  dpkg  l libpangocairo 1 0 0 amd64  to locate these files  i'm not sure if this counts as a bug or if there is a more system independent way to write this  but it's a step beyond the documented installation instructions i had to take 
yes     you beat me to it   i was just committing the same fix  i'll still make a pr  as i have added some tests 
oh  i didn't know about that  but there's more  when i set the opacity value of the color to something  it looks like the color were translucent  but there were a black solid background behind it  so  for example  #ff0000 results in a bright red background  but #ff0000 2 gives a very dark red  as opposed to the almost invisible transparent red i want  
 frostidaho from what i understand  they seem to be just fine  internal setup 
 ramnes no  i have explicitly  cursor_warp   false   also i did check with default config  where it is  false  as well   and i have just checked with  cursor_warp   true   just to be sure   and it doesn't influence my problem in any way 
 qtile python3 git 2645 5ec03621 1   i got this behavior using "xterm" 
not sure why exactly  but modifying the desktop file to be the following seems to do the trick   i _think_ it's the inclusion of the  desktopnames  field  anyway  this can be closed now i think  thank you

yeah  exactly  thank you 
the two methods need other two parameters     move_floating dx  dy  curx  cury      resize_floating dw  dh  curx  cury   on  lazy window move_floating x  y   is sent only two parameters  on  libqtile window  there are the functions on the lines  1327 1333    i don't know why need to pass 4 parameters to the function  because it uses only two  so  when i tryed  keybinding  qtile cmd or via qshell   just not worked  two parameters missing 
yup  if i xrandr back down to one screen and restart qtile  then things work as expected 
i have it installed  but i do not know how to make an error file  i ran it in a command window  the configuration file in my home i do not have it and i tried it with the one that comes by default anyway it gives me configuration error in the bar below  maybe it's a problem of compiling python in debian
only notices that some optional libs are missing  wifi etc 
yes  i update qtile  but that was a while ago  anyway i just started zathura and it has the same problem  so it looks like this is not a qtile problem  this issue can be deleted i guess 
sorry  i don't use qtile anymore  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ original message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ on friday  march 13  2020 2 57 pm  tycho andersen  notifications github com  wrote 
step three at the bottom  http   docs qtile org en latest manual install index html it says to create a  glue shell   but the file it's referencing is specific to  venv   i e   activate   i'm not sure there's an equivalent in  conda  
it generates "config error"  i think i'm setting up the widget but still my config breaks  tho running "python  m py_compile    config qtile config py" it doesn't says that a made any mistake in my config  but still my config breaks   here  https   gist github com godnyx f943b93af25b5de9ffd59159dae56752  is my config 
dj uses yaml serialization  i think the problem was some where in the serialization of one of the syntax nodes  i don't have the stack traces on hand atm  i could construct a test case  it was creating log entries over 6k lines long for each failed job  the error happend when i called from_addrs  adam
i ended up just connecting over localhost 25 instead of using the send process  probably not worth investigating if it's working on your end 
i'm newbie in ruby but if it helps i have added some tests  https   github com aleshgo mail commit 7c45dc48a84cea836b886b005b5b416d3ab4c956
hi  ahorek  thank you for your response  some software is known to modify convert messages in a subtle way  e g by converting the transfer encoding to 7bit  quoted printable  or base64  or removing trailing spaces   it doesn't matter for many users because the meaning of the message is preserved  the message will be delivered  and will be readable  that said  when you're going to sign your message with open pgp  and probably some other tools as well   you got another problem  such alterations typically invalidate the signature  for this reason  both rfc 1847 "security multiparts"  and rfc 3156 "mime security with openpgp"  make restrictions on transfer encoding  they require that the signed message part is encoded either as quoted printable or base64  and has no trailing spaces  and this is the only reason why i want to force the transfer encoding of my choice  the problem is explained in detail in rfc 3156 section 3 "content transfer encoding restrictions"  and somewhat in rfc 1847 section 2 1 "definition of multipart signed"    https   tools ietf org html rfc1847   https   tools ietf org html rfc3156
ok  will do in the coming week  thanks  jeremy 
thanks for the explanation  eugeneius   jeremy i can try get you the specific test case on monday  or  at least  a minimal reproduction   i'll see if i can come up with something now  but i don't have a development environment of any sort for this on my personal machines 
hi   jeremy  thanks for the quick response  i just tried both 2 7 1 and 2 8 0 edge and the problem is still reproducible on both  if my reading of https   github com mikel mail pull 1062 is correct  it only added support for the utf 7 binary encoding and not the utf 7 quoted printable encoding 
i just updated to the latest git and it's still there     
big help  put the django toolbar in 1st on middlewareclasses  now it works fine all over
not sure if you got my emails or not  i can't see them here   but anyway  this is the error message i get  template error in template  library python 2 6 site packages django_debug_toolbar 0 8 4 py2 6 egg debug_toolbar templates debug_toolbar base html  error at line 49 caught attributeerror while rendering  'template' object has no attribute 'origin' 39   div  40    for panel in panels    41    if panel has_content    42  div id "   panel dom_id   " class "panelcontent"  43  div class "djdebugpaneltitle"  44  a href "" class "djdebugclose"    trans "close"     a  45  h3    panel title safe     h3  46   div  47  div class "djdebugpanelcontent"  48  div class "scroll"  49    panel content safe    50   div  51   div  52   div  53    endif    54    endfor    55  div id "djdebugwindow" class "panelcontent"   div  56   div  57
it just doesn't load  it never did on 1 8 0  then it did on 1 8 1  then it stopped when we updated to 1 8 2  i looked around and found some questions on stack overflow that mentioned changing to order of apps that load  and i tried that and it didn't help  if there's something specific we should be doing to get this to work under gae  any direction would be greatly appreciated 
yes  this fixes the problem  very clever and clean fix 
hehe  that's it  this is from an admin page  everything in there is from 'django'  which is excluded from the trace…
thanks  this has done the trick  i guess there were stale _ pyc_ files hanging around   
thank you for the reponse  no errors that i could see in the console  upon further re testing today  the problem appears to have gone away  the only thing i've done is removed and re added the app in my settings file  haven't rebooted or done anything to my browser  chrome appears to be the same version still and i haven't upgraded anything 
no errors  and i just tested with master branch and still same issue 
i can check  but is there a separate way to disable the profiling panel apart from disabling debug_tool bar in installed_apps  also  i can provide a back trace of the occurrence if you're curious 
perhaps a note in the documentation regarding using the toolbar with projects using javascript libraries that define their own global  require  function would be a good idea  the warning could describe the above solution  i'll submit a pull request if i get a chance to work on this 
no  this is not a error  just warnning but it cause http 500  the last few lines like 
ok  page show is   aaaa  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3354923 9127445 cdfdab36 3ced 11e5 877b 0cf9f11d5658 png  the request is    bb  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3354923 9127633 32e106b8 3cf0 11e5 951b ae7a6530253e png 
that's what's recommended in the documentation  http   django debug toolbar readthedocs org en latest installation html#quick setup adding gzip to that and setting  debug  to  false  will cause the exception 
which code did you use 
 matthiask yes  that fix works  thanks for suggesting it 
i am using chrome version 73 0 3683 103  build officiel   64 bits  this is the latest version  i have the same problem on safari  on ubuntu 18 04 with chrome   firefox the problem is the same
ok got it thanks for link 
i'll check  but can you provide more information about what to look for

i am on ubuntu 8 
sorry for such a bug with so little information  yes i am using linux  i am a new developer for source mage gnu linux distribution  i work mostly on simple updates of the packages  so i updated my version of pyqt to 4 6 and checked if anything that depend on it broke  soon i realised that cola is not working  i tried to recompile where i got that message  you can find full compile log here  http   www pyrobor si linux cola 1 3 9 14   but strangly it doesn't break the build  but when if i try to run git cola i get  the cola gui modules have not been built  try running "make" in the cola source tree  tell me how to make traceback in compile and i will make it 
if i open repo  click into commit message editor immediately  then i can type  also  following a stage  the commit message editor continues to work fine  it only fails if i open a repo  stage files immediately  and then try to add a commit message 
doh  i totally forgot to check my version and inform you what my environment was  i'm running v1 4 3 5 on ubuntu 12 04 64bit  i assumed that i was running a late version since i installed it several weeks ago  turns out that the version available by apt get is rather out of date your commits do fix the problem so this is resolved 
thanks  but it does not help  the git code starts always with german language  how my operation system 
 alt+ctrl+0  seems like a good suggestion  though it's probably a good idea to check with someone who uses the bindings regularly  and on other os's  
sorry it was merely a suggestion i am no artist  i use git cola every day on ubuntu though and love it   the icon just seems a little outdated 
awesome  git cola keeps getting better and better 
 davvid no  i am proposing integrating the whole git deps web ui 
hi  davvid  on the time of opening this issue   latest commit on master was 59e686e099abe0a3ff7da7e35e9bc8ca0d1b4b39  i can confirm  that build from this commit still reproduces described issue  however current latest commit from the master 4409089292cbdf86282c54a4b7e95d2d8e48f3fb doesn't have the defect anymore  so  we can close this issue  i think  anyway  to prevent such a case for new users in future   i would still put a step with  git checkout  on latest stable and tested version 
sorry about opening such issue here  do you know how can i contact the fedora package's maintainer 
yes  this exactly  changes to "this repository" are preserved  while changes to "all repositories" reset as soon as i move to a different tab in "preferences" window   davvid   i will try to check what you describe 
i made it public now  https   github com armandg aasenit
the revert fixed it  the "success" list comes from calling table   on the query table  for some reason  we decided to make table   return a string instead of being void  i don't think fitnesse does anything with the result  so changing table   to not return anything also fixes the problem  however  i'm guessing a similar problem will occur if the query method returns list with an element that has    in it  see https   github com gshakhn fitnesse commit da9bf793bc1d4b01551e6f94ecacfb14f3e23835 for a test case 
not sure why you say hundreds of rows is fishy  we switched to slim few months ago but this issue is common in both  this is a very common use case  all of our tests had to be refactored to smaller tests  had been trying to resolve this since a year now  yahoo groups never responded 
sorry i forgot to include that  but i'm using 20130531
my apologies    my fault  i hadn't bothered to run all the other suiteacceptancetests is a while    i should have  the entire suite ends similarly and it's because i renamed the jar  this issue should be rejected closed 
just a lot of stuff  such as json serialized documents and ensuring that certain elements are in there via regexs   
we have a lot of templates  some are generic global to the entire suite and some are scoped to specific suites  there are about 15 generic templates so far and can be another 15 20 specific to another suite  our goal is to have a template per fixture as documentation to qa of our available fixtures 
hi linquize  sorry  not very familiar with github   i've opened https   github com unclebob fitnesse pull 422  cheers
hi apologies for not checking this before stirring things up  indeed i have used older version of fitnesse 
thanks for your help and sorry for the delayed response on this  it looks like the issue was just in the weird version  not sure how that happened  a more recent one fixed the problem  if it's still of any interest  the memory usage would grow to a normal size at the start of the test and then spike right at the end  after the test was finished  memory usage would not decrease  running the test multiple times did not cause the memory to spike as dramatically at the end but did increase memory usage over time  again  the newer version of fitnesse fixed the issue so it's probably not an issue any more 
this happens in every single search i run  title or content based  whenever the search is complete  that seems to be the pattern   this does not occur when doing a properties based search  which i thought was kind of peculiar 
our problem is  everybody can create new pages on the root level  for example  this fitnesse instance works with fitnesse ldap authenticator    fitnesserio  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9351430 5200214 860629b8 754a 11e4 9402 191623091136 jpg  i don't have access on frontpage  but i could create this page  http   fitnesserio ep petrobras com br 8080 helloworld   fitnesseriohelloworld  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9351430 5200252 1abed88e 754b 11e4 84ad b5da61de5bcf jpg  we need to know how to protect non authorized user to create new pages on this environment  thank you  regards  lívia
good to know but i haven't tried yet 
it's bombing at this point     any ideas from that 
i managed to get it working by changing the method name to   public boolean checkifsorted list  string   values    so  this is definitely looks like a method naming issue  i would like to know the rules and why   issorted   cannot be found by slim system 
 six42 for example  if im testing a list of apis using the restfixture  i'd like to pass a root urls using a properties file so that they're all in one place  i could define them all in the root but i'd prefer them outside of fitnesse files  currently  i've added them into  plugins properties  but was just wondering if there's a way to pass multiple properties files to fitnesse so that fitnesse plugins config and my properties are separated out 
yes 
to ensure highly available sut and abstract the web server from running the test  it's not a big issue but is nice to have    i'm can think of some workaround to do it but i want to know first if fitnesse slim support it out of the box 
we are using our fixtures  included on classpath   so i suppose it will be translated to symbols  right now i increased heap to 8gb and looking what is happening there  for you request   i will try   
i have defined vm arguments in the command_pattern on the root page of fitnesse  what i want to do is i want to override those arguments before running every test page on the front page of fitnesse   tcnh
unfortunately not  but i came to a similar conclusion  however it's pretty much unclear _which_ page is wrongly formatted   
but how to rename them one by one with code  not manually  i've read the fitnesse code  but still not found simple way to do this 
all hundreds of  other cases passed  except this one

that works a treat matt  ta 
i can't see any error message  but if i use   out 'features  report html' in cucumber yml  i got "features" instead of "features report html" i means i want to use whitespace in the filename and the directory  e g   at a result  the report will be generate in "c  test"
i have tested on linux and mac os with ruby 1 9 2 p290  the path which the error ocurred were    Área de trabalho project  
i know  in this patch was applied  the whole constantize method could be refactored away  replaced by  eval arg    to me it was most important to illustrate the problem and a solution  the rest of the code i constantize is doing some input argument sanity validation  actually i would like to see a patch could turn the variable  constant  into the fully qualified constant name including the prefix  cucumber  formatter     for built in formatters   so basically i would like to see a better patch than the one provided by me  anyone 
yes   i saw those timeout settings in code  however the error is coming from line 35 here  https   github com cucumber cucumber blob master lib cucumber wire_support connection rb#l35 in which there is no timeout config being passed in  therefore the timeout defaults to 3 seconds

i've brought it up with the pry team via this issue  https   github com nixme pry nav issues 14 i happen to use the step function of pry manually more often than the step function of cucumber  simply because when debugging cucumber code using pry  i'd like to be able to step  this is probably the behavior of other developers who use both projects  keep in mind that cucumber runs fine using step during normal execution  it's only when binding pry is placed that there exists a problem  this problem of namespace collision isn't unique to pry and cucumber  and it's a bigger problem that the ruby community needs to solve as a whole  but perhaps a good band aid would be to create a function called cucumber_step  and have step call cucumber step  and have a parameter passed to cucumber somehow to optionally not define the step function  for users who don't pass the option  cucumber operates the same way  otherwise  step wouldn't be defined and there would be no collision 
oh i'm sorry  this issue was for my application  i didn't realize i wasn't in the right repository when i posted it  i'm taking it down now  sorry 
my apologies  this is irrelevant for the ruby cucumber 
 mattwynne i'm a little short on time but i'll try  i've got some other projects to maintain and i'm trying to get them all ready for when i show up to cukenfest 
this issue happens when launching displaying ssh command  which generates some utf8 output  the ssh command is launched via open3 ruby library  operating system  fedora18 afaik something similar happened  when inside the step  there was an attempt to get web page with  curl http        which had used utf8 formatting  when i get more information  i will put it here 
hi  sorry for the delay in response  i have been away from work  i found the problem   i had previously setup  rspec autorun  as a dependency  in part to clean up the stacktrace on an error  see https   gist github com brass kazoo 8588975   this is largely unnecessary now and have removed it  i suppose that autorun's exit hook code is what is actually causing the error message  and not cucumber  teamcity is now running and reporting on the tests properly 
this is a problem with the released gem  i have not tried testing with master it is the same issue reported at https   groups google com forum # msg cukes ysbx8qddscg fpndveipzuyj basically  when the proc is called the first time  the test runs just fine  each subsequent run the steps all get printed to console as if the test is executing  but the actual step definitions are not exercised  i have verified this through debug logging as well as some cursory work with the debugger 
in  #build_step step_hash    step_hash  multiline_arg   was  nil  in v1 3
hi matt  because sometimes the  visit  method works as expected  meaning my variable is www assembla com and it redirects me there but sometimes it adds this text   content index m php  with apparently no reason and randomly  i don't know what's causing this  do you have any idea 
okay   brasmusson the cukenfest is june 21st   25th  so maybe you want to release cucumber 3 0 0 during the event term  right  i saw your guys' face photos in the event page  it is in london  it's close from my living country czech republic     though i won't attend the event  i hope the event's success  😄
no  i don't have the syntax gem
thanks for the quick reply  the test case you brought up is structurally the same  however  there are two differences    in the test case i linked the insert is done using a prepared statement   in the test case i linked autocommit is turned off i think both differences are valid uses of odbc  if you follow the link you find two code examples  one with sqla  the other with plain pyodbc  i am reposting the example with plain pyodbc here 
 mkleehammer it is server for testing purposes  but anyway i replaced username and password in text to strings with same length  all other information is relevant  https   gist githubusercontent com pentusha cfacb9f4c24842fcf8fd0726a2291eb0 raw 44a73ab6f49e16b22108331a7df0e5b07c702306 odbc_trace_format log https   gist githubusercontent com pentusha cfacb9f4c24842fcf8fd0726a2291eb0 raw 44a73ab6f49e16b22108331a7df0e5b07c702306 odbc_trace_parameterized log
i'm afraid the version from  fix199  doesn't seem to work in my case  minimal setup to reproduce the issue  1  create virtualenv  do  pip install uwsgi pyodbc   2  create  wsgi py  file with   5  run the server   uwsgi   ini uwsgi ini   http socket 0 0 0 0  two things i figured  seems like  enable threads  is irrelevant  the issue also reproducible with python 3 4 
yes  these are older servers  can i get one of the older versions out of pipit 
 gordthompson thank you for confirming that sql is passed to the driver  i just run multi values insert in native netezza client and got exact same undescriptive error "42000 27 error  found " "  at char 49  expecting a keyword"  you are correct netezza sql is not sql 92 compliant and this is not an pyodbc issue 
i work on both platforms but files are stored in windows server and the script is going to work on windows server also 
iodbc remains the default in macos   as of 10 13 3  https   opensource apple com release macos 10133 html   apple did stop shipping their home grown  odbc administrator app  some while ago  and told us  i e   openlink  that they would encourage users to shift to the  iodbc administrator app   and  iodbc administrator64 app   which we had provided from day one  apple never did ship the frameworks build of iodbc  for reasons we were never told  which remains surprising and frustrating  as many significant apps  not least being microsoft office  build against and require the frameworks  they cannot operate with just the dylibs    which also means they cannot run with just unixodbc  in its standard build  your comment about "the open source unixodbc" suggests that you may not realize that  iodbc  http   www iodbc org   is also open source and is also  here on github  https   github com openlink iodbc   iodbc and unixodbc are generally api equivalent from the application and driver perspective  iodbc has full macos native ui implementation  and has since roughly mac os 9 0   which differs from unixodbc  homebrew and macports projects do tend to have different variants for linking to iodbc vs unixodbc  because these are built on each user's machine  and the user might prefer to link to frameworks vs dylibs  or to dylibs in   usr lib  vs   lib   once built  the binaries don't usually care  as long as the library names and locations are consistent  as they are in a default environment  you building against iodbc  whether frameworks or dylibs  does not limit user choice of drivers in any way  foss and commercial drivers alike build and work fine  with no cost for use of the iodbc sdk 
django error  find attached the odbc trace  sql log  https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc files 1794261 sql log  schema  the table is called dbo parserdb2_question so the schema would be dbo

just about 1000 rows  i don't know the question should belong to sybase or pyodbc 
sure    odbc log  https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc files 2105296 odbc log  contains the trace from running above test script a single time

 v chojas i am unable to get odbc trace  because i am unable to restart the python process only running inside a container in a kubernetes pod  meanwhile here is odbcinst  j output
python don't know '  ' basicaly  so have to expand it using 'expanduser' function  it expand '  ' to real path  ex    homebrew include      users reznoa homebrew include
i did try that and i know what kind of problems does it solve however in these cases it didn't help it's strange because the exact same query works perfectly with database administration software but with pyodbc it only works after i start removing parts of the query  i kept on experimenting for hours and i couldn't reach any reasonable conclusion on what exactly is causing these errors other than the query being "complex" 
i have tried using both python 3 4 5 and python 3 5 on opensuse 42 1 latest version of unixodbc  2 3 4 currently  i have microsoft's official linux drivers installed for sql server 11  13 and 17  trying to run this program against any of them results in a segmentation fault  when running the program locally on my windows machine using sql server native client 11 0  and either python 3 4 or 3 5  it does not result in a segmentation fault 
will do  working on a good example now   it seems my trivial one doesn't reproduce so there may be additional complexities here that i'm trying to track down  not sure if i'll be able to get an odbc trace for you since i'm not an admin but i'll speak w  our dbas and see what i can do  on tue  feb 26  2019 at 9 49 am v chojas  notifications github com  wrote 
 v chojas and  v makouz   thanks a lot for your responses and suggestions  i updated my password as  password   ' xxxxx ' removed the port from connect   call  my new code looks like this   import pyodbc server   'xxxxxx database windows net' database   'xxxx’ username   'xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx com' password   ' xxxxxxxx ' driver   ' odbc driver 17 for sql server ' conn_str    'driver '+driver+' server '+server+ ' database '+database+' uid '+username+' pwd '+ password   connection   pyodbc connect conn_str  'driver  odbc driver 17 for sql server  server 'xxxxxx database windows net database edw uid xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx com pwd  xxxxxxxx  '   the error still continues 
unfortunately not  the code is closed source and the query is closely coupled with the database design  not something that could be easily reproduced 
upgrading unixodbc to 2 3 7 indeed fixed the issue  you're awesome 
thanks for the very quick response  a setting of this sort would be great for me as i only ever need 1  the last  result set  in the meantime  i have worked around the issue by just re connecting with a modified version of the the injected conn string to have the database that i need  just posted issue here in case others come across this 
this is from an install of pypy3 6 downloaded in the last 2 3 days right off the pypy site  pyodbc should work with pypy  correct  thanks  m
so i just realized that i was ignoring disregarding warning messages in ssms  which  i believe  results in cursor not being a query and pyodbc throwing programmingerror "no results  previous sql was not a query " the warning  warning  null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other set operation  set ansi_warnings off solved the issue  therefore it's not a bug  thank you both 
character encoding of connection string is utf 8 and server locale setting is en_us utf 8
i can give you a full trace tomorrow  the error occurs in   usr lib64 ruby gems 1 8 gems friendly_id 2 2 0 lib friendly_id rb 65 in  has_friendly_id'
all is working perfectly with 2 2 5  many thanks for your responsiveness 
2 2 5 rake task was updated with   script generate friendly_id   skip migration i miss something 
seems to be working in 2 3 0  sorry about that   
 norman that make sense  my workaround is the same  i won't be able to tackle this anytime soon but agree with you on supporting any character type field as primary key   thumbsup 
yes i did  rails  initializer run do  config      config gem "friendly_id"     end apparently rails is not able to find the gem  though it is installed and called  gem list   local     friendly_id  2 3 4 
thanks for your quick answer here is a complete app that illustrate the problem http   github com cyrille speciality just run a console and run speciality create   title    "toto"  several times and you see the errornomethoderror  undefined method  friendly_id_config' for nil nilclass bty i've just discovred that if you don't have cached_slug it's working  maybe a hint of the issue 
i dug into the code of both versions and it seems that the misunderstanding is from my side  if i remember correctly then the older version first queried all appropriate record based on the slug and then filtered the collection based on the scope  this allowed to evaluate the instance methods of those records returned by the initial query  in the new code it does things differently   it queries the records based on the slug and scope right away  which is clearly more efficient   so if i understood it correctly then its impossible to do what i described before  it also does not make much sense and "accidentally" worked before   
there are multiple types of users  the foreign key on the productions table is user_id  the abstractuser class uses  set_table_name  to make the database table just "users"
hmmm    where do i see what version is supported with 2 3  on the homepage  i e  readme md  it says "friendlyid is compatible with active record 2 3 x and 3 0 " and "friendlyid will continue to support 2 3 x until rails 3 1 is released " i don't think rails 3 1 is out    is it 
the friendly id is generated automatically from  say a page title  the page's title is controlled via cms by a client  they named their page  say something somethingrelated    i don't have control over what they do  should i tell them not to use slashes  i mean    it just makes an unreadable url #   " somethingsomethingrelated"     why can't i have it make "something somethingrelated" 
hey norman  i have not solved it but i made a hack to fix it  going directly into mysql code   the bug still exist but i can report it again when i get back to the issue  right now i can't  sorry  christoffer 2011 10 11 norman clarke   reply reply github com  ##
yes  saved the post with friendly_id  the code that is generating this query is the following 
hrmm    that may be a fair assessment  i guess i am trying to achieve something like this  http   stackoverflow com questions tagged  net how do i allow the tag name   slug to be   net   likewise  how would i go about achieving that with  c#   i can see that so does it by doing  c 23    but which helper method in the view would i use to convert the name  c 23  to  c#  
confirmed rc1  here is the output   and get the same issue 
philip  yes  this is debatable  i opened a pull request to rails rails#12663 that uses blank  instead of the nil     empty   they are using now  but one of the initial comments on this was that the rails docs state that to_param returns a string  it is cleaner to adhere to the specifications of a function 
happy new year  compay  so it turns out that  as usual  i was wrong  ftr the versions i'm using are rails 4 1 6 and friendly_id 5 0 4  my mistake was trying to regenerate the slug for a case  without having populated the  friendly_id_slugs  table for every existing record before  so now  with an empty  friendly_id_slugs  table i ran this in the console   that populated the history table with the current slugs  after that  regenerating a slug worked fine and took my 2nd ption from the  slug_candidates   before it wasn't able to find the existing conflicting slug because it didn't exist in the history table yet  although it existed in the cases table   here's for a great 2015  cheers  ps  i decided to keep my dependency with 5 0 4 because it's the latest stable  should i really upgrade to 5 1 0 beta1 even being a beta  is 5 0 4   that   buggy

thank you for your reply  i delete the  emacs desktop ant it works well again      the version is emacs 24 4  maybe i should try another version

thanks for you quick response  i try to comment out  require 'init ido  it still can't not work correcttly  after i added ' current language environment "chinese gbk"  everything work great  thanks you config is really great 
hi  thanks  it works   but i got some unexpected issues  probably no related to this software  the global performance of my laptop got affected  it's got slowed down  so slow  it takes long seconds to react and operating  so i had to remove the  emacs d file and starting again  
24 3 on both of them 
yes it dose but some codes added to ini locales el are to be a failure do you have some better way to solve this case 
i am on windows there   
i have no ideal  i will check this tommow  may becouse the version of orgmode i used  steve purcell notifications github com于2015年7月1日周三 下午1 44写道：
yes  i did not install git  i never used it  my emacs seems performs well after git bing installed  thank you 
emacs version  25 1 1 system  x86_64_centos6 5 yes is it  using in in terminal 
 earthisaprisonifyounotawareitcannotout see this  https   github com purcell emacs d blob master lisp init folding el
i don't make any change to the configuration  i just turn up the emacs and c x c f a new file  with m x makefile mode  it's good when i just edit the file with tab  but when i save it with c x c s  the tab just become to 8 whitespces 
yes  i tried to restart emacs and it still doesn't work  then i delete  emacs d and get a new copy by 'git clone'  however  the issue is still there 
it is gnu emacs  i started it by   nw  i'm on   macos high sierra 10 13 3  
i picked some dot el file in lisp directory for myself in emacs configuration  function named kill back to indentation is provided by init editing utils  i write hahah some whitespace   and then invoke this function  it kills the whole line  emacs version  gnu emacs 26 1
yeah  it works with your updated repo  thank you for taking time to fix this minor issue  would you briefly explain  for someone who knows little about emacs  how you solve the issue  besides  you suggested  in https   github com purcell exec path from shell #setting up your shell startup files correctly  that "config files should therefore set the environment variables to their exact desired final values"  but  that can be out of some users' control  in my bash_profile  for example  there is "export path " users zhfu anaconda2 bin  path"  which is automated added by anaconda2 installer  apparently 
if you believe it's a bug  then i can try attacking it from that angle  i just wanted to make sure i wasn't doing something dumb 
 troessner thanks 
 mvz i'm using it through rubycritic  which isn't up to date to the latest releases  anyhow  giving how similar they are i think my threshold question applies to both smells 
here is the method  the config reek is located at the root of my rails project where i run the  bundle exec reek  command  i'm using version 3 6 0 
no  we don't have usage statistics 
ah  that makes sense  since that method is defined in a third party gem  devise   i guess we'll have to exclude the whole controller  which removes the warning   and live with the fact that if a prima donna method is defined there  it won't be caught by reek 
 rkh there is no way to upgrade even to 1 1 for me   
passenger 3 0 5
still happens with the current master  i will try to reduce it to a simple test case and update the issue 
ok  thanks 
i use rack 1 6 0  the test jodosha 416aade700d258581d58fb9c5046e0f86129c09e passes successfully  but the test aingvarf d0b636c979c2aebfcea10144557b788680391ade fails  ie sends second post request with auth data and empty content  but set header content type equal to firtst unauthorized request and content length   0  i suppose that parsing content should be avoided if header content length   0 
when fips mode is enabled on a machine it does not know that it is used for check sums  the fact that any time md5 is called  regardless of its use  the system will reject the call 
all i did was update rack from 2 0 8 to 2 1 0  ran the specs and got some failures  there was some middleware involved in my real case scenario  yes  however  i managed to get a minimum example to reproduce the issue to provide that here w o any middleware and so on so that you can check that w o having to dig into a bigger app and stuff     i don't think it's the responsibility of a middleware to get the content length right  but rather the server  however as there was nothing in the changelog about such change for 2 1 0  i would put that as a regression 
looks like it's  this  https   github com rack rack pull 1034  and i've misunderstood the original pr comment on our internal repo    leading to the erroneous conclusion none of the statuses work  we used   error  which as you say is incorrect  and used to get 500  switching to   internal_server_error  works and tests pass 
i tried with master because it's where i spotted new pending_timeout option

the memory use does increase regardless of  objectspace each_object   but i see your point  i actually first came across this because a small sinatra app running on thin  fine on unicorn  would bloat to 500mb ram overnight  this is what i ended up tracing it to  i believe evanphx has submitted a patch for this issue 
it happens more often now  so pls help  it's hard to describe the bug fully but there are some infos that you can imagine it starts progams by  def start # cmd  programhandler and logger are predefined stdin  stdout  sterr  wait_thr   open3 popen3 cmd  eventmachine  attach stdout  programhandler  logger  end def stop # kill processes of programs that needs to stop # close stdout    end the script does stoping  starting many times and the bug happens when it starts a program or stops and starts a program again  can you help to fix this thanks

i first tried the  github pages  gem  jekyll and liquid bundled in it  and found that none of its version works  it was first released at sept 2013   i then tried to find some anchor points  as follows  works    jekyll  0 12 0  + liquid  2 6 0    jekyll  0 12 1 + liquid  2 6 0  not work    jekyll  1 1 2  + liquid  2 5 4    jekyll  1 3 1  + liquid  2 5 4   the latest combination  the test source is my blog repo and relevant  post_url  tags are highlighted in the this diff  https   github com hupili hupili github com commit d1fea8bdfd30e3fd0b4e0c83e2fcebbde7b00f45 jekyll locks particular liquid versions in recent releases and i don't know how to try more combinations  what i know from a user's point is that my github pages used to build successfully  without changing anything it fails to build recently and the complaint is that  post_url  can not find those posts  the  github pages  gem was also released recently and all versions fail so i don't know what versions they use previously  the real problem is probably the inter work of jekyll and liquid  i'm not ruby developer and find it inefficient for me to trace further  i put the issue to liquid because it was the direct source of error message  it will be very helpful if you can locate the real cause and redirect it to the corresponding project 
hm  why do you think that val should only be string       etc  val   liquid drop  correct me if i wrong   if i use a liquid_methods in my models it will automatically generate liquid drop class  proxy  for instances of this class  in this case i can add  length to liquid_methods and it will return length property of my model 
please consider it a feature request then 
oh  gosh  you are right   i forgot the "s" at the end of  code strip_newlines  code   sorry for bothering you  but it would be really great if this could be clarified in the documentation  https   github com shopify liquid wiki liquid for designers   there it says     code strip_newlines  code    strip all newlines   n  from string maybe better would be     code strip_newlines  code    strip all newlines   n  or   r n  from string and another thing i'd love being included somewhere is that you can use both single and double quotes  like in javascript  for filtering  this can be important if you want to refer to single or double quotes in a filter string  e g  replace all double quotes with a single quote   code replace  '"'  "'"  code   or is it possible to use backslashes there  e g   code replace  '"'  ' ''  code

 salexzee   thank you for following up  yes  correct that is what i have used to solve this issue for time being but according to shopify documentation and experts this is not a good practice  we should be always be using  asset_url  for all the assets files within style sheet  you can get more reference from  comment  https   ecommerce shopify com c ecommerce design t images url s in the style css file 109049#comment 109130  of  jamies on shopify forum  lets say in near future  if shopify implements some folder structure or other thing for images and scss then it might break our style sheet 
let's just chalk the problem up to my general level of retardation   my pandoraone subscription expired  thus i was denied access to the higher quality stream  once i paid  the problem was "solved"  not sure why i didn't receive a notice    i'll have to dig around in my junk mail  apologies for the bother  at least maybe someone else will see this when encountering the same "problem"   b
awesome  the debs don't work on 10 04 yet because the libfaad has been moved 
sure  one thing i would like to do with it is send the current song to an irc channel  how i do so in shell i will figure out   i would like to have a hotkey instead of doing so every time the song changes because i skip music a lot and it would be spammish if everytime the song changes it got sent  another possible use case would be to download the album art and open it  thanks 
how would i know which version i'm running promyloph   i used sudo apt get install pianobar so i assume it would be the latest one
i'm not sure    it's worked for the past several songs pianobar has played  is there a way i can have pianobar tell me what kind of files it's playing 
i was mostly thinking about situations wherein  for example  i was out of the room or something for the first part of a song i really like  or something  but as you say  that's not really how pandora's set up to work  so fair enough     
how can i tell which libao backend i am using  how can i change it 
thanks  login now works  after i select a station i get the following error       select station  18    station "the beatles radio"  205760935311199805   i  receiving new playlist    error  playlist end  and it doesn't play  not sure if it is related

it's a hack if you consider the distortion a bug  you could call it a "digital boost support" feature for the libpiano  clearly it is not a feature for the pianobar front end  if that's the case then that code is the right path  0 is 100   volume down seems to have some sort of logarithmic slope that never actually reaches 0   although at 42 its pretty dead  so the question is  is it a bug  or a feature 
sorry  posted this in the wrong thread  will move to pianopub 
how do i access that response body 
well   that's weird  making it with  g caused it to not segfault  and after removing  g  make clean    make  it still works 
is there a way to remove those keyboard shortcuts completely  that way i can see if it's my script sending in strange characters  on mar 25  2012 7 03 am  "promyloph"   reply reply github com  wrote 
i applied the patch  and got this error now   i  receiving new playlist    network error  unknown http status code  it hangs on that  i think perhaps if there's an error  it would be better if it exited instead of hanging  so the script can sleep for a few seconds  and reconnect  i'm not sure if the error is because of a hiccup at pandora  or my network 
sorry   just a standard port install of pianobar v2012 05 06 itself    sudo port install pianobar      computing dependencies for pianobar      fetching archive for pianobar      attempting to fetch pianobar 2012 05 06_0 darwin_11 x86_64 tbz2 from http   packages macports org pianobar  snip    pianobar welcome to pianobar  2012 05 06   press   for a list of commands   i  login    ok   i  get stations    ok   snip 
didn't know that was possible  thank you 
registered with a new account and the new account works fine with pianobar  strange 
i get no output from  readelf  a pianobar   grep "ffmpeg"   so it appears that i am not using ffmpeg  should i  make clean  and  make  again 
if i have pianobar running while i create a new pandora station  i'm unable to play my new station until i restart pianobar  and i would like to be able to refresh it without shutting it down and having to re login again 
look at the network traffic  when i pause a song downloading stops  unpausing does not cause it to resume  when i skip a song  next  downloading continues but there is no output and pianobar shows that the current time in the song isn't moving 
turns out it was my mediocre internet 404ing
i recently installed pulseaudio so maybe it's using that  i don't have '   libao'  what do you recommend i try for default_driver 
i haven't been able to reproduce the problem until actually i opened up any type of internet browser that's when it starts causing errors like decoding error   channel coupling not yet implemented  bitstream value not allowed by specification etc  i'm not sure if that was the cause of it or not but it was working just fine when i didn't have one open if that makes any sense  another error came up where pce shall have the first element in a frame 
yes  sporadically  i'll go2 3 hours with none  then i might some bizarre spanish ad  and a few songs later  an english ad  then it seems a few songs after  it locks up  when i quit and restart  no ads for another 2 3 hours
no i can't download the songs  i just get a 0 byte file  i don't use ffmpeg

hi  tivie   thanks for getting back to me so quickly  yes  exactly currently the contents is parsed as markdown  i am indeed currently using a lang extension to workaround this problem  but i believe that it will become increasingly common to have custom elements in our html and that support for this should be built in  if you didn't want to treat all custom elements as block level  one option would be to provide users with a configurable white list of matching element names to check   
sorry  i guess i filed this too hastily  looks like it's something else in my codebase stripping them

i understand about the abstraction  and in this case would go with what the services prefer to call it  they are closer to the fis  and probably have a better handle on what things are called in the financial world  after a quick google search  it looks like   descriptor   would be better than   description    some call it billing descriptor  transaction descriptor  so  statement_descriptor  seems to me like a good choice

the problem i'm trying to solve is bounding box searches that cross the 180th meridian  in the past we solved it by breaking the search into two params as you see above  if sunspot already accounts for this let me know  a solr query that works for this problem looks something like fl solr_id score qt dismax qf id 9 title 7 description 1 qs 100 fq  latlng   82 940327 59 164389 to 85 831591 180  or latlng   82 940327  180 to 85 831591  99 741861   start 0 tie 0 3 pf title 10 description 5 ps 20 wt ruby mm 2  1 5 80 25 sort status asc  score desc  updated_at desc rows 15

unfortunately  i'm not that strong in either ruby or rails  and i don't have the time at the moment to dig through the test suit and figure out all of the appropriate idioms  i pretty much only discovered this bug because redmine is affected by it  i'm more of a savvy consumer than a legit developer in that regard  that said  if i can dedicate myself to the task in the near future  i'll take a crack at it

ok thats positive  thanks  could it be to do with datetime fields  this is a sql server datetime field   is ar trying to do some coercion on it 
this is my  config database yml    it runs  activerecord  tasks  sqlserverdatabasetasks#structure_load  twice because i have two databases   payroll_employee_data_dev  and  payroll_employee_data_test   but on the second time through  it looks like  #connection  is cached from the previous run  and thus it tries to apply the schema twice to the first database 
4 2 1 i'll take a look thanks 
 chrislusted  i removed the validates of column  it's fix 
i think they are stored as datetime  the process is  that there is an input field where a string with the date is input  a save is then called on the object  what i would like to happen is than when a date is input the time is automatically set to midnight  for that particular field  i am guessing that somehow in the save action  time zone parse input_string  is used  instead of input_string to_datetime   i guess what i could do is explicitly call to_datetime on the string before save  that might actually solve my problem  would be nice to have some sort of functionality that says "don't timezone this field"  though 
happy to help  it's better  but not quite there  everything seems to say that this attribute is now _datetimeoffset_  which is great  it even will keep from changing the timezone automatically on assignment  but something is happening when i actually save the object   prior to the current change  the timezone would get casted on assignment  just to check  i also tried using the  skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes  method  to see if that hook is appropriate  but the behavior was the same  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord timestamp html

just sent it to the mailing list  according to the prophecy   pre  setmathfont asana math otf   pre  did not work 
i did  you find it at  http   gist github com 609545 meanwhile i realized that the problem is not directly related to unicode math  loading fontspec instead of unicode math creates the same problem  in fact i found that it is enough to load the eu1 fontencoding  this points to a bug in xetex

that makes sense to me and would solve my problem as well 
has it been  deprecated  http   www w3 org tr html5 text level semantics html#the mark element  
i'm not sure how to answer that question  i think that you are asking what technologies are being used in this project  as far as i'm aware it's ror  bootstrap  backbone  posgresql  and haml
example for the second message 
 with leading newline   nothing specific  actually  only the     highlight html     syntax works
i did not realize that  that should be fine too 
on the first two cases  inline code scenario  which is different from code blocks  there shouldn't be any syntax highlight in the sense of "programming language syntax highlight"  instead there should only be some text formatting  a bounding box and a background  in detail the bounding box frame and text color are the same as text  while the background in that box the same color as the background color used in code blocks  and the font the same as used in code blocks  https   github com adam p markdown here wiki markdown cheatsheet#code i mean inline code doesn't get highlighted  require 'kramdown'  code blocks do
hi  my code is here on github   https   github com gregonnet blog  https   github com gregonnet blog  i use  nanoc  https   github com nanoc nanoc  which calls the kramdown library  nanoc provides a filter for  kramdown  http   nanoc ws doc reference filters #kramdown   this filter calls kramdown     view file  https   raw githubusercontent com gregonnet blog master content posts articles 2016 08 27 how to setup nanoc with guard md   i hope this helps  if there is any thing else i can help with  please let me know 
i understand now    thanks for clarifying  gettalong  time for me to go pester github i guess  that'll go well  
 gettalong i attempted to figure out what may have changed  unfortunately i've updated ruby  jekyll and all other deps  as far as expected output  i'm more of just an end user of jekyll and kramdown  so i can't really speak to that  i was able to overcome my issue with js and ids with leading numbers  and as ids with leading numbers are valid in html5  it really isn't a kramdown issue  thank you 
 gettalong there appears to have been a practice  whether or not there was a standard  see the site i linked  and many others like it  which rely on it  i would want it because i can grab the value in css with  attr     afaik  there isn't an easy way to do that with a class  language lang —or at least  not with css  i'm sure js could do it  but i don't want to write some custom js to grab all the languages and create new dom elements for each page  jquery could do it  but i don't need it otherwise and don't want the bloat   with css  it's as easy as a    before  and  content  attr 'data lang'    again  as far as i can tell  this is what  used  to be done  and i can't figure out how to make it happen for me now  worse  other folks  like the site i mentioned  seem to be making it work  but i don't know what markup hosting they're using  with github pages  i'm tied to kramdown + rouge  which i'm fine with   and i'm partial to triple backticks  because the     highlight lang     is a pain to type 
it happens after clicking install  second screen after entering shop url   openssl 0 9 8r 8 feb 2011
i cleared the browser cache and cookies  tried in ff  chrome  and safari  all reproduce the same issue  i'm running  6 0 4  on a fresh rails build using the generators 
quick question   any setting i can update so that when i refresh the browser i don't have to sign in again  seems like i'm killing the session somehow   ok  back to the issue  yes  but if you look at the gem page here  https   github com shopify shopify_app and then go down to this section  shopifyapp  sessionrepository it still has this   class shop   activerecord  base def self store session  shop   self new domain  session url  token  session token  shop save  shop id end def self retrieve id  if shop   self where id  id  first shopifyapi  session new shop domain  shop token  end end end
i'll get back to you  i am working on an app tnx
most browsers allow third party cookies  in the oauth flow  in the exchange of tokens etc  dealing with sessions  etc  there is usually also a need to write cookies  in this case  most browsers work well  however  safari by default allows no third party cookies  thus in any embedded app connection attempt  when exchanging tokens and dealing with the sessions  safaro chokes and the result is an oauth failure  labelled as csrf_detected  only by setting safari to allow cookies does the embedded app session get initialized properly

i am not validating anything in my model  you can see the code i provided  i do a shop save which triggers the correct update  but it is always preceded by that exists  which seems to be a shopify thing  perhaps from this concern  i am just curious  i see the logs  and it is on every single update inside the block shop with_shopify_session  module shopifyapp module sessionstorage extend activesupport  concern included do validates  shopify_token  presence  true validates  api_version  presence  true validates  shopify_domain  presence  true  end
hi kevin  thanks for your response  i spoke to heroku and was advised that there is an issue with  redirect_uri   i also see this error in command line  nomethoderror  undefined method redirect_uri ' for #shopifyapp  configuration 0x007f98d3bcaa98  can you advise if this is some issue with shopify_app gem  
i actually didn't change anything from base template  this is my routing 
 markiiikram  thanks for looking into it  in my case  i think it's just something that a few merchants have set on their browser  perhaps to increase privacy  or even unknowingly  often a merchant's staff will use a shared computer  on which someone changed the cookie settings at some point in time  maybe without knowledge of its purpose  so  it's difficult to track the real reason 
 alanhill when i tried to use any of the api  for example  shopifyapi  product count  then i will get that error 
thanks for that   working good

i am not using faker in a rails app   it is a simple ruby script   is enough to reproduce the problem 
it's in the project folder  so   sites project lib locales en gb yml
thanks  supremebeing7  i modify it into  gem 'faker'  '  1 6 3'   and it works 
i am using  faker 1 0 1 
perhaps writing a script to find all end points in the yml located here  https   github com stympy faker blob master lib locales en yml and calling   length  on each element to get the length of each end array could be an option 
of course  first of all  i can not use symengine pow 2 2  for example  that does not work  because there is no function pow in symengine  atleast if i do help symengine  in the python console there is no mention of the pow function  i should probably begin with two sentences  i need a fast way of transforming the symbolic function in c code the reason why i need this is  that the integrands that i construct are couple hundred lines long  and at least in sympy that takes a long time to integrate and that's why i proceed numerically from there  ok now to the c code part  i'm using ctypes to integrate a function  because this way it's much faster  for this i need to convert the function that i constructed symbolically into c code  this takes a lot of time  when i was searching for a faster way to do symbolic computation i ran into you guys  symengine is build on cpp so the code is similar to c  for example  when i do sympy exp 2  in the python console it gives exp 2   but with symengine exp 2  it's e   2   so thats already very similar to what a c function should look like  for faster integration i need the pow   function  with it i would not need the c code printer from sympy  i just could use the output of the function  i programm almost only in python  maybe i should change that  but for now and for a lot of other people that would be probably a good feature  best wishes

thanks  with 1 9 3 everything works fine  sorry that distract you 
 scambra   the first option would work for me     overriding the do_list  method and skipping pagination  thanks for the workaround 
i hacked myself up a quick solution in the active_scaffold js file by adding a few lines to delete_record_row  i just grab the next tr at the same level of the dom as the row being deleted  then if that row has a class of "inline adapter" i remove it from the dom as well  seems to work for my needs  but maybe not a very clean  or general  solution  i'll note that i noticed this issue on 3 1 6  then upgraded to 3 2 0 and still had the problem 
i just tried and i get the error even with the defaults settings for a scaffold  if active scaffold can not work without jquery ui  it could be set as a dependency  but i understand it could be problematic depending on which jquery ui version people want to use  the easiest solution would be to mention that jquery ui is needed in the readme

this is vanilla fat free crm  downloaded as the zipfile  i haven't changed anything except for the ruby version  i also  as i understand it  cannot create directories and install anything other than the gems and plugins that are part of the application setup  i doubt i can correct the path on heroku  i assume unicorn is installed as a gem on ffcrm  i didn't get any time today to look at this  i think the best thing at this stage may be to delete the application and start again 
fresh install of ffcrm  created a personal list  saved it    and boom  it seems to do the save  because the list entry shows up  but clicking on it any time will hit the error 
i cloned the master branch and we are running on the commit 1a2b61c1fb6f142bc1fb8da71f23fb4d5c0417c1 there was no minlength specified in the fields table  so i added that column   alter table  fields add column  minlength  int 11  default '0'   and also added minlength to the allowed options and that works  it does not feel like the optimal solution but not a ruby programmer        w as collection disabled label placeholder required minlength maxlength  include  k     v blank   i would say it would be a more clean solution to just add "minlength 0" to the options sent to the forms renderer by default  or to fix so that the forms rendering class does not set "minlength" to the maximum value of the input type

oops  i just noticed the last example of the  currency exchange  https   github com rubymoney money#currency exchange  block   seems like   it's already possible   to do what i was asking for  it didn't work for me last time i tried  maybe it was just something wrong with my code  i'll check again and re open if i find a bug   semmons99 i was talking about actually converting but behind the scenes by checking the exchange rate on the default bank  which seems like it's already been implemented 
yeah  unfortunately  #max  and  #min  are implemented in c code  here's  #max  for instance   from  https   github com ruby ruby blob 9b94249f39bff401465340639bed1f2a93b62ebf enum c i'm not familiar enough with ruby's c code to really grasp what's going wrong  i do know this code is ultimately calling  money#     though  and that this method is working as expected  i agree it's no biggy  just to ensure the array is all  money  objects before hand  that's how i'm working around it   it's just that this really caught me off guard because all the other comparison methods             etc   work fine with a mixture of  money  objects and plain numbers  the fact that  #max  and  #min  _don't_ work as expected  definitely breaks the   "rule of least surprise"    which probably isn't a good thing when working with financial transactions

do you mean doing this in my local app like this   or can i submit a patch to rails i18n so that it is available globally for everybody  i am asking this  because i've seen that some people have submitted prs for other words in the past  but i am not sure exactly where this can be done  thanks once again 
the second example should return a eur amount  due to £0 and €0 being equal  a zero money object should not have an explicit currency and should be considered to be any currency value
ok  i looked deeper into the problem  i didn't knew you took i18n rules into account already  my current understanding is  that before you took the i18n rules into account if present  otherwise fell back to your own rules i assume  with 6 10 1   both things i ran in the bundle of my rails app  but just with irb  so i don't expect any tainting from our configuration or other gems  only  money  was explicitly required  the i18n rules are extracted from our rails app 
oh  thanks  i agree  but i think this line  can be something like 
i want to display total price and price difference from total price i don't need for minus option  ex  expadia  hotel + flight search  img width "920" alt "2019 01 01 14 43 38" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 6077520 50570567 c1ab4b80 0dd3 11e9 9571 ecac6507e5bb png" 
hi anstorm  in my app  in application rb i have deffined    if the fallback worked with the spanish translation the symbol should be the euros symbol and with my overriding it should be " " but none of those are been seen   instead with the currency set to "uyu" i seen ₱  i hope this could clarify what i'm doing  how i think money fallback to i18n it's not working and help to improve the gem  thanks  mateo

thanks for the quick response  since the operator of the admin page will be a non english speaker  it is desirable to have the menus in there language  and because the language is a 2byte character one  it is not possible to have model and action names changed to fit them 
sure totally gtalk is the same as my github  the run down is i can't reassign what the referencing table is when editing a polymorphic object  i have a polymorphic image table that allows image to be attached to a bunch of things say a "user" when i edit an image  http   localhost 3002 admin images edit 1  i can't change that relationship from "user" to say a "person" i have to remove the image and create it on a person would be nice if it allowed a drop down with a list of models that a polymorphic association can attach to 
here is the configuration city  fields  default  name  priority  active form  name  priority  active order_by   priority  name relationships  filters  name search  name application  dealzza thanks

no luck so far  it only happens on our production server which is serving about a million people on average at one time  so i can't really mess around with it too much    i cannot reproduce on my local setup  i'm going to keep poking at it though 
i reproduced in a minimal environment  while the application i'm writing should run on google appengine i moved  djangoerror_t  in a template and replaced the following lines 
ah  by accident  was looking at another issue  sorry 
perhaps post request had more amount of data     in my case it was xml text data     and size would not be more than 1 mb     but it has text line this  lt someelement gt   lt fewchildrens gt   lt  someelement gt   lt someelement gt   lt fewchildrens gt   lt  someelement gt  few some elements in text format
the key would be the url regex  value would the class to handle the request 
i'm not sure  but i will just be cautious when naming template files 
the first two errors reported are indeed generated in that way  the last one is triggered when raising an exception inside any render function when running a frontend application

i did not use your overlay at all  i'll double check the gst plugins  just in case  and i'll give a try to your overlay  i'll also try with qt 5 9  but if demo works with 5 6 2     but i'd like to keep 5 6 2 as it's the official  i mean  for gentoo  stable one for now 
probably not  #291   the same problem  qca is installed but it's not recognized i've added path to qca and now qca is detected  i use others programs with qca qt5  okular  konversation  without problems  for example   konversation  git version   ubuntu  debian  arch  fedora have a qca qt5 packages in a repo  i think that psi requires qca qt5 instead of qca 
i read the thread and realized i was not using if_content as john long expected  i was able to make use of if_content "as is" now that i understand it from another angle  it wasn't intuitive for me  i naturally expected it to work based on whether or not actual content existed  as was argued in the thread  
created a clean gem instance of it about an hour ago  just did a few tests there with safari v5 0 and ff v3 6 6 and both yield the same result  when you create a new page with multiple page parts  3 in this case  and hit create page the 2nd page part gets lost however when you click save and continue editing it saves fine

sorry  i don't    the misbehaving page is on my local machine  it looks like this  the tabs just disappear altogether  and instead i get a vertical bulleted list that hangs just outside the left of the containing page  at the moment i'm investigating roasters yml  to see if i can find anything in there  i did correct the image locations  to point to the demo site   and all images seem to be rendering correctly  it's just that one tab setup 
thanks for the responses  got it now 
i installed it on osx i set rvm to ruby 187 and used gem install radiant   prerelease i generated two sites one with the blog and another with coffee roasters because i was thinking it was related to the content  i got the same error in both cases  everything seem to be ok except when i open an item on the content menu maybe it's a version thing with my installed gems tom brooke on thu  jun 2  2011 at 3 29 am  spanner   reply reply github com wrote 
will put it on my todo list  thanks for helping 
john  thanks for the help  i updated to the latest radiant fron github  i haven't tested the app on heroku yet because i lost my style and js  it looks like the 1 0 0 pre sheets extension is not working right  any ideas

that is not the issue  it is ruby 1 9 2  the ruby 1 9 1 you see in the stack trace there is a well known ruby bug that outputs the wrong version  nothing to worry about there

hey benny thanks for the clarification  makes sense  i'll swap out my fork with upstream 1 0 1 and see if i can figure out why that's going on  guessing this is due to the combination of the site i'm upgrading and its old extensions so   it's gotta be something in there  is 'name' something that gets passed in from an extension's config  i'm grasping at straws here without looking at the code directly  ha
afaict each has different behaviour and each could does appear within some common 'snippet' context making it nigh impossible to work out  just by reading the code  that what is going on with 'usage' on line x  nothing  like what is going on with 'usage' on line y 
sorry  this is with 0 13 7 
yes  you are right  i wrote them myself and made a pull request  https   github com wycats thor pull 107
i stand corrected  thank you  still  if there isn't an issue with doing a local 'tmp'  or 'tmp' plus random number to prevent collisions   it would be easier to write cross platform code  rather than having to detect the system and then use different environment variables depending on platform 
certainly 
👋 hi rafael  nice to hear from you  it really depends on what the sub commands load of course  my subcommands are provided by other gems so i don't really have influence of their loading behaviour  i do get your point tho  i can also just tell my other gem implementers to have good gem manners and use autoload 
just forget about it  thanks 
because that's what the  options  hash is constructed from  when i want to extract values from it  with  #slice   and pass it into my own libraries that provide their own default options  with  #reverse_merge     it gets corrupted

hi  i updated neo4j to 3 0 8  we use enterprise edition 
jruby 1 6 6 gems neo4j 1 3 1 java
sure i'll have a look
it's not the problem since the last release  since there is no need to execute the neo4j jars command  
mea culpa  it seems that app restart helped 
bundler is not able to bundle straight from your repo because it says that your gemspec is bad  i guess i am requesting for you to you support bundling direct from your repo  if that's not possible  i will wait for your next release which seems to fix problems with  accepts_hash_for   i have a workaround which is to always provide a block 
ooops  my fault   do you think we could use a similar approach to solve the load fixtures question     issue #611 
rails 4 0 3 neo4j 3 0 0 alpha 3 jruby 1 7 9
two questions in fact  i  in the neo4j core  we do index labels like below  does this apply to rails usage as well  or rails version does some kind of an auto index to labels 
i think it depends on the context  a "drawing canvas" containing new geometric elements  canvas  contains   element  needs an update on the "canvas"  but  say a "blog post" having new comments  post has  comment  does not need an update on the "post"  maybe it should be an option  where creating or deleting a relation or changing an existing relation's property is an update to its  start_node  and  end_node  
this is a new piece code     but getting the same error with 3e386d50dedc8a5704c1247e7a77b0ac0242757f from sep 6   
thanks for the quick feedback  i assumed that ar 4 1 7 worked in rails and i was having problems because i'm using sinatra  somehow  when i add the neo4j gem  my app loses track of the environment variable  here's my gemfile lock 
actually  yes  as a new user of the api i was expecting where and rel_where to accept the same parameter changing only their underlying context node and relationship  respectively   i think rel_like would be a better name here because what you are sending as parameter is an example of what you expect
yes  it can wait  i was planning to work on a feature i'm building using active job sometime early next week 
hey brian  cannot reproduce without reverting applied migrations  but will keep looking at similar classes  with those type of names   be aware that using inflections  or not  is also impacting on this 
yes i included the concern after the neo4j  activenode  but anyway  thanks to  subvertallchris  you solution worked perfectly   y 
hi brain  the returning method works with the count as strength  which orders the highest correlating users  but i'm having troubling accessing the enumerable after the return  trying to figure the best way to deal with the problem  most likely some kind of map method from neo4j core  on tue  jul 14  2015 at 12 51 pm  brian underwood notifications github com wrote 
i would suggest to follow ruby's principle of least surprise  or at least to document the fact that something does not work as one may expect  as it happens in this issue  
i spoke with _someone_ about it on gitter but i can't recall with who at this point  if this was a neo4j quirk however  i would like to see neo4j rb handle it more gracefully than unexpected behavior  from the user's perspective  
ok  i'v changed the version  i've tested more versions before posting and forget to change back   i've changed the config neo4j session_path to 'http   localhost 7474' instead the local ip and now it works  thanks for the quick response 
here's the class definition   there's no custom  to_json    i did play with it a little to massage the data  but quickly switched to creating a custom method to return json 
yes  that was the problem  in the hanami framework  hanami  entity  redefines attributes  not including  hanami  entity  fixed the problem  upon further notice i realise that i should not have even included  neo4j  activenode  in the  entity  class rather it should be in the  repository  class based on hanami architecture of things  should i close this issue 
sorry about that one typing in the wrong window  please ignore  on 06 05 16 19 02  brian underwood wrote 
this is just a regular   find params  id     i am explicitly using transactions elsewhere  but i ensure that these are closed
it makes perfect sense  thanks for taking the time to explain  i also see your conundrum  in order to print a warning  you would effectively have to respond to the idea that the gem is being run in a rails project  which creates an explicit coupling to rails  i suppose you could print such a warning whenever a command is forwarded to neo4j rake_tasks   but i suppose the most reasonable way to deal with this would be to just put a line somewhere in the docs 
sure  let me have a go

hi justin  thanks for your quick response and troubleshooting  i did see a comment in one of the discussion groups that the ckeditor  which i am using  might be related to this kind of problem  in any case  i will try some your suggestions and see if we can nail it down  regards  david

hi justin  i am using a nginx proxy behind apache running dadamail with fastcgi  nginx adds the real_ip header  because remote_addr is the ip of the proxy   this are the environment parameter  and in my concent logs i always get the  remote_addr  instead of the  real_ip

i have seen the issue on android 4 1 1 but only on certain devices  specifically samsung skinned devices   i have attempted to reproduce this problem on other android 4 1 1 devices but have not seen it  why this problem only appears to happen on certain samsung devices is a mystery  i was able to track down the problem to  line 72 of transition native js  https   github com yui yui3 blob master src transition js transition native js#l72  where it attempts to determine if it should use a vendor specific css prefix by checking for 'transition' in the document style  in the case of the problem devices it guesses it does not need to use a vendor prefix  because  'transition' in document document_element  style  evaluated to true  however later on down in the code in the _runnative method on  line 324  https   github com yui yui3 blob master src transition js transition native js#l324  it filters out properties that are not in the node style member  so what happens on these devices is that it tries to use css properties like 'tranisiton duration' and 'transition delay' but those properties are not available

yes  it affects 3 10 3  here's a simple test case  https   gist github com brunobasto 6002949#file testing yui 3 10 3 custom events wildcard would be nice if you guys were able to include that in 3 11 0  thanks for the quick answer  satyen 
yes  i have event focus loaded  http   www orangebits nl code gallery slidecheckbox gallery slidecheckbox html
i would expect the result to be the equivalent of nodelist gethtml   tostring  
yeah i'm going to have to rename the attribute  i just found the behavior a bit confusing because when i think of a list i assume it will allow duplicates  but in this case it's behaving more like an ordered set 
yeah  i'll do that  give me a little bit to set that up  what do you think about it for the other components  though 
thanks for the fast response  who is supposed to close this bug

ryuichi  the reason to allow for “no”t setting the env parameter is for performance reasons  when the ‘env’ parameter is set  yql will do a backend http request  so the default is to hit ‘datatables org’ for all requests  in my case  none of my tables are part of datatables org  i don’t need that backend request  brock davis 404 345 3440 yid  brocktriplets from  ryuichi okumura  mailto notifications github com  sent  tuesday  december 31  2013 2 56 am to  yui yui3 cc  brock davis subject  re   yui3  yql request defaults env parameter to open tables  no easy way to turn off   #1509  ah  i understand now  yql module set env parameter to the community tables at datatables org as default indeed  i think it's basically works fine  why do you want to turn off the env parameter  — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com yui yui3 issues 1509#issuecomment 31386945

i'm using the newest stable version of firefox   29 0 1 and yui3 3 16 0  here's the piece of code i'm using in my app  it works everywhere except firefox    in the  initializer   of appview  i'm not able to do anything with the promise named  template  by using   then    method  i tried to debug the  promise js  module of yui3 and i found that function stops executing in  try     catch  block without any error  as i mentioned above 
 okuryu  thank you for the response  i'll file an issue on the correct repository 
i found the bug last night   it's in active record  i can fix it there  but rails3 has totally refactored how this works so i'm not sure if it's worth submiting it  does it make sense to try to retro fix ts to work reliably with 2 3 5 
the "rescue" does not work within my application  too  here is a simplified snippet of code   despite the "rescue" the exception is raised  btw  the option "ignore_errors" is working fine  but i want to catch errors by myself  my environment    ruby 1 8 7  2010 12 23 patchlevel 330   i686 darwin10    rails 2 3 10   sphinx 0 9 9 release  r2117    thinkingsphinx 1 4 1
i am using globalize3  https   github com svenfuchs globalize3  i took a quick look through their source and i didn't see update_index being defined  and i am not redefining update_index 
doesn't work either  but 'ico' should also work  at least it does on the old system without rt indexes 
hi pat  i tried to use absolut paths  but i cannot get "out" from inside the deployed release  it's in a docker container   absolut paths inside that container are only absolute to the container itself  so from inside  folders on the host are not accessible  unless going through a shared folder  but that shared folder's path is different from inside the container than when seen from the host  when i use option 2  running sphinx from inside the deployed container  and i try to start searchd from within the release directly  like you suggest  i get this 
ah  right you are  pat  while the problem only became manifest in 2 0 5  it looks like it could more rightly be attributed to the awesomeprint gem that we are using in rails console  specifically  it's being caused by the "irb integration" part of the awesome_print install  https   github com michaeldv awesome_print taking that out of  irbrc fixes it  something about the "ap  context last_value" on the result of a sphinx search doesn't work quite right 
hello  i was wrong  problem is not in ts  it is in ts delayed delta  when i save my model on every save tsdd add job to index delta even if i just do "post last save"  post changed in this situation return false 
yes  that looks like it will work  thanks 
its rake ts index
works with  datetime   so now the only error i get is   so is there any special way of handling excerpts in thinkingsphinx 3  
this is the first line of my app indices user_index rb  but for the moment  i didn't setup any solution to "treat" the delta indexes 
hi pat  i had run ts rebuild  but doing it again produces an error  error  index 'site_core'  sql_range_query  error  function array_agg   does not exist line 1     al_class"  0 as "sphinx_deleted"  array_to_string array_agg       hint  no function matches the given name and argument types  you might need to add explicit type casts   dsn pgsql   postgres     localhost 5432 ppe_development   which is a bit odd because it's a perfectly valid postgres function  could this be to do with the fact that it's interfacing to searchd as mysql 
if i just do  school query 'foo'   it would return results that can be paginated etc 
thank you for the quick reply  problem is solved now  actually i was not change the address in the sphinx yml  now in cofing development sphinx conf and config sphinx conf are same address 
i currently have  gem 'mysql2' gem 'thinking sphinx'
that's a good point about not needing to restart on every deploy  i hadn't though of that  i think i put it in originally so i wouldn't have to remember to restart as when i did in fact change the index definitions or configuration  i may well take it out as far as i can tell  the previous searchd process doesn't get killed properly  here's a snippet from the log   i'm going to do a quick deploy now to verify this   
  service_index rb  
yeah  similarly to mysql2 parameters  that does sound better  abstracting away the peculiarities of sphinx config  i almost went this way at first  but it required too much monkey patching  and i had to get things running here  plus i didn't know where you'd want things to head to 
good call  thanks    on sep 11  2014  at 10 26 pm  pat allan notifications github com wrote 
the thinking sphinx version that i've previously used is 2 0 14 the sphinx version that i use right now is sphinx 2 0 4 id64 release  r3135 
yes i use standard destroy  footage destroy
yeah  i've tried  bundle update joiner   no change  we're on  0 3 4   the index is on the content model  content  has_and_belongs_to_many  locations  and  belongs_to  organization   organization _also_  has_and_belongs_to_many  locations   i'll try to generate an app from scratch and see if i can duplicate the issue outside our app 
thanks for the reply  i'm putting a load balancer in front of multiple machines serving the same rails app  the app uses real time indexing and employs ts for filtering and search from the app's index pages  ideally the configuration would follow the distributed model provided by sphinx  http   sphinxsearch com docs current distributed html what other info can i provide that you would find helpful  thanks 
hi pat  thanks for the tip on  min_infix_len   i've also enabled the  expand_keywords  option  as described  here  http   sphinxsearch com docs current html#conf expand keywords    it wouldn't fix my issue  but seems nice to have   my config thinking_sphinx yml file now looks like this   neither wildcard search nor substring search are working  even though the sql surrounds each space separated search string with     characters  i've also tried activating  enable_star  and  min_infix_len  without  expand_keywords   i'm still able to match individual complete words  or consecutive and non consecutive sets of complete words  but i can't match partial words  with or without wildcards  any other tips you have would be greatly appreciated  thanks 
i found the problem  putting  ngram_chars  in the config file causes this problem  and it was unnecessary for indexing "arabic  persian and urdu"  setting the right  charset_table  does the trick i e    charset_table  0  9  a  z  _  a  z  a  z  u+621  u+63a  u+640  u+64a u+66e  u+66f  u+671  u+6d3  u+6d5  u+6e5  u+6e6  u+6ee  u+6ef  u+6fa  u+6fc  u+6ff 
sometimes once every few days  sometimes more  i didn't notice any exact periodicity  sphinx  3 0 3 mysql  i don't have access to the server now  so i don't know the mysql version  thinking sphinx  4 0 i got a call from a customer describing a problem  a few hours later he said that the site was already working  this means that the connection was first lost  and then appeared  i looked at the cron and saw there the periodic re indexation  it is possible that reindexing somehow restarted sphinx  or thinking sphinx 
yes  i was just going to look at this  get the stack trace and also see if i could write a failing spec for it as well  i'll comment with more soon

in this example i have project has_many tasks and a lot of unassigned tasks  i'd like to enter id's of tasks  that may be found for example with autocomplete  and submit to application  currently it's submitting as string  is there any way to submit as array 
i'm running justinfrench formtastic  0 2 4 
using version 2 3 5
i created this example  schema rb create_table "posts"   force    true do  t  t string "title" t text "body"     end app controllers posts_controller rb def index  search   post search params  search    posts    search all end app views posts index html erb    semantic_form_for  search do  f         f input  title_eq        f buttons       end    when i try to go to http   localhost 3000 posts i get this error  undefined method  new_record ' for #class 0xb5f6a094
never written any     i'll definitely add asap  can you point me to a good primer 
i use rails 2 3 5 and formtastic 0 9 7  best regards  boris
running tests on latest are passing  i submitted a pull request 
it is true  i was calling "form semantic_fields_for  user company do  company "  when it should have been "form semantic_fields_for  company do  company "  sorry  this issue can be closed 
sorry  forgot to mention  rails 3 0 0 beta4 + formtastic 1 0 0 beta
yes  my bad  was not in the rails3 branch  also i remember checking out the 1 0 0 rc tag  which i thought was about the rails3  one more unrelated issue  while on rails3 branch i get these warnings   does not happen on the master branch 
i believe it may have been a bundler caching error  so i'm closing this  thanks for the follow up  originally  when i attempted to update to rails 3 0 0 from 3 0 0 rc  bundler claimed formtastic still required 3 0 0 rc  so i pointed the gemfile to formtastic's git master  problem solved  i just pointed the gemfile back to 1 1 0 beta  and the error is gone  i'll take it up with the bundler team  thanks
interesting  in my environment  and heroku's  the 1 1 0 gem and rails 2 3 8 causes the hidden_fields statement to be escaped and therefore it appears on the screens  under 2 3 8 you have to force formtastic to bind to 2 3 8 rather than 3 0 0   at least in my case  i call the formtastic method this way   78  as     check_boxes  79  label    false  80  label_method     name  81 # value_method     description  82 # collection     group id   83  input_html      style    "width 20 "  84     groups is a habtm relationship
thanks so much for the feedback  justin  my app still works fine if i install activesupport 3 0 2 manually before formtastic  so will do that for now  just one more reason to move to bundler asap  my personal feeling  as someone who has contributed nothing more than a small bugfix to formtastic  is that  since it's a rails specific library  removing the activesupport dependency probably isn't such a bad solution for now  edit  just saw that the readme does state that bundler should be used 
i'm not sure what you mean  running  rake  should yield a failing spec 
it's a semanticformbuilder  creates in this partial   the code i posted initially is the body of _link_to_add_fields_
https   gist github com 806227
i did a fresh install of formtastic  using bundler  my gemfile entry reads  gem 'formtastic'  '   1 2 0' bundler cannot find the repository for v2 0 0 when using the gemfile entry  gem 'formtastic'  '   2 0 0'
okay  i'll keep my quick and dirty fix on my working copy  thanx to both of you for your prompt answers 
there are no commits since 2 0 0 rc4  https   github com justinfrench formtastic compare 2 0 0 rc4   master
here is the generated minimal html  https   gist github com cedb5ed4e41bada82fe2  just add the formtastic css to the directory  and the erb that generates it  https   gist github com 7f164d29916e443481c9 the custom input is here  at line 71   https   gist github com 1030551 firefox 4  safari  chrome 12
yes  i have restarted server etc  the problem is still there  i'm using rails 3 0 3 and formtastic 1 2 4
formtastic 2 0 0 rc3 indeed resolves the issue for me  i was doing some custom wizardry to allow a date picker field type  which does not work "out of the box" with 2 0 0 rc3  so i'll have to tackle that before upgrading  thank you for the quick response and resolution  and for working on such a useful library  
i made the spec  but i didn't send a push request because it passes  https   github com taavo formtastic commit 8ab6b3f26b8cedce774a4470bccb127f055d4e02   my live code  unfortunately  continues to fail  for the record  i get the same behavior when the code is simplified to the following  and it behaves the same whether user status is a string or a boolean    i just created a fresh out of the box 3 0 9 project for testing  and got the same behavior  3 0 10 and 3 1 0  works correctly    seems like it could be easier to update to 3 0 10 than troubleshoot this 
at the moment i was just looking at an ugly       f input  born_at   as     string   label    "date of birth"   input_html       value    f object born_at strftime " d  m  y"      wrapper_html       class    "date"       i'm all up for other options of course  and versions of formtastic   i'm currently on 1 2 4 i thought about creating another input type to do what i'm after but i found the code a little over whelming  oops 
"studies show that those side by side inputs  as opposed to a nice uniform series of labels and widgets  actually perform way worse in user testing " you are operating on outdated info there  or you aren't thinking of specific cases where it makes sense  like with an expiration date  credit card numbers and security codes  for too general of an accusation to make  either way it seems like  wrapper_html    false is a logical feature but we basically went with your #2 response before reading this  thanks for the response 
nice  it works   small correction  post  copy  has to be  post   copy 
hey justinfrench  the version where that was working was the 1 2 4  
 justinfrench yes i guess most people just don't display these readonly fields in edit form  my use case is mostly through activeadmin  thanks for taking time to explain and good luck fighting magic   
simple  i wanted to access form element  i wanted to append some html to it  so needed handle to it  though i had single form on the page  wanted to have a clear way to select it  so found  namespace would assign id _ namespace  to it  but not found working  i ended up using   "form formtastic" 
i tried locally and it works as expected    i think the same must be fixed for  time_picker  and  datetime_picker   if you need more help with writing failing specs or something  i will be glad  just let me until next week  now i'm in a work storm    
sorry  justinfrench  had some connectivity issues before being able to fil the issue body 
thank you for answer  i've made update in so post  so the part of problem solved  but anyway  i did not found any mansion about polymorphic associations  so i spent all day for digging  you may use my so post as a template  i will be pleased is it useful   
in this case  a list of string input and a "add more" button to add an empty input to add more tags  i'm not looking to add relation datas or datas that already exists on db 
hello  i use raphael 1 5 2  i have fixed the problem  raphael el destroy   function     this node raphael   null  if this paper top    this paper top next   null    this paper top   null  this paper bottom   null  this prev   null  this paper   null  this group   null  this 0    null  this node   null     this function removes circular references between objects  memory leak was through this   this node raphael 
ok  i understand  out of curiosity though  is there a reason why svg patterns are not supported as a fill in raphaël  i was under the impression that it could be done by svg specs  as for whether it is supported in ie6  i do not have ie on my system to test it  sorry 
i try to explain better   i not speak english very well   in my application is use raphael library and raphalel freetransform whit raphael i visualize the image and text  for example when i draw an image with paper image src  x  y  width  height  where src is a fisycal path in my file system in explorer the image is visualized well  in chrome  i see all white and when i click in the space where the image should be inserted i see only the raphael freetransform  for text  instead  if i use paper text   and associate to it attributes  font weight and font style  in explorer work only font family and font size but any value for font weight or font style not work  in chrome instead work  still  in explorer with raphael freetransform  i can move the object any object  text  image  with chrome raphael freetransform does nothing  thanks
 lazurowy the background    funny  try white http   jsfiddle net begm9 1 
version is 4 1 1  i try send simple mail but it take a while process before sent 
no  the smtp server handles the splitting 
yes it does  i tried to run  composer update  thinking that it will fetch the latest commit of the swiftmailer repository but it didn't  nevermind  this is fixed with this commit  thanks 
i'm so sorry  i had two projects one in sf 2 0 and another in 2 1  i made a mistake about the file that i have to change   
what do you mean by this  i didn't get you
hi fabian  i have tracked down the issue  and it's not your framework's fault  really sorry  this is a  known  bug from godaddy com  is seems  a lot of issues we had with their hosting services and this just adds to the list  and again  although the issue was reported for long time ago  they didn't fix it      i've found this by trying the test script prepared for you on another hosting service as well  and there's ok     here are some related links about this on godaddy  http   support godaddy com groups web hosting forum topic wrong return path added to outgoing emails 1  http   forums phplist com viewtopic php f 24 t 38416 i've convinced my client to cancel their services and move to a more professional hosting  you can close   delete this one   thanks 
hey fabien  yes  errors appear when my server has php setting  _disable_functions_ "show_source  system  shell_exec  passthru  exec  popen   proc_open   allow_url_fopen" laravel and swiftmailer are not checking for missing functions and i get the mentioned error message for  pipes  so  after defining pipes  i was getting down to a deeper problem  what happened was that i could not send out emails on staging environment  and was very hard to work out the cause  i have given up and now just using mail       ps  i'd like to know why popen and proc_open would be disabled  security reasons i know  but why would swiftmailer require them if it's problematic and opens up the server to security issues  then    is there a way to temporarily enable these things while an email is being sent  would be good to get ideas from people with better understanding of linux servers  php  mail and security    note  currently on a _shared server _   chris on 12 april 2014 18 12  fabien potencier notifications github com wrote 
 sstok that work really well  now i have to figure it out how to use it on symfony with the mail queue   thanks a lot

 xabbuh composer json  this is the minimal code needed to reproduce the issue  i think now that the issue is related to deepcopy  and not swiftmailer 
swift_transportexception  expected response code 250 but got code "421"  too many messages 
i went to the website and wondered  "hey  this looks like sinatra"  so my initial question was whether it was a coincident  which it apparently wasn't  i then wondered how much it differs  and was hoping to find some statement on the site somewhere  also  give blake some credit by mentioning sinatra  it won't cost you devs  since ppl would use it in the first place due to perl   i mean  the basic api of  mojolicious  lite  is an exact copy of the sinatra api  plus all the websocket api  you could point that out as an advantage over sinatra  btw   but if you don't feel like it  ok 
all things being equal  probably not  but  every_param  appears to have been added to compensate for  param  no longer returning a list  providing alternatives for everything but  defaulthelpers  param    makes   could make a big breaking change more difficult to deal with when upgrading 
no idea  but it's clear current behaviour break things at least for very usual values in href attribute  and conflicts with at least one spec  am i should dig whatwg spec too for some reason 
d'oh you are right  there was a call into  self  app in startup indeed  looks like that was no problem before  so error on our side  thanks for the hint

it's not a huge issue  it just seems a tad unsanitary to have debug artefacts publicly exposed in my prod environment  it's a bit of a lurking corner case  i could very well just ask nginx to not proxy requests to  mojo to the app at all  but it seems like an unneeded layer of complication for every deployment to include  since i'd need a different config for nginx in prod dev   for those who are into jquery and are using it as part of their app  perhaps at a newer version there's now this goofy case where there are 2 versions of jquery on the site  which could be enough to allow bad guys some kind of foot hold  say an xss that loads the older one to get back an old jquery bug   would y'all be open to a pull request that "fixes" this with a similar mode switch to the one logging uses 
yeah  if the convention is to use " " and not "_"  then i agree that it doesn't make sense  i tried to find if there was a standard consistent way via googling  but i didn't find a consensus  i have two use cases i've done this for now  one was using "_" in urls for a site where that was already the delimiter and i wanted to keep the urls the same  the other was to create a valid subroutine name from a string for a mojolicious helper  which to be fair isn't really 'slugify' ing since it's not meant for a url 
ha  you're right  that's my mistake  it looks like those would be the same  i'll go ahead and close  thanks 
i use the following to benchmark  time  hires  time  vs  core  time   and although t  hr  time is  3 times slower  it still runs at  14e6 s    70ns per call  vs  25ns  on my computer 
thanks for the heads up  tried again with mojolicious 8 12  results unchanged 
even with just one promise  it's the same result  given this  #  usr bin env perl use strict  use mojo  promise  use mojo  useragent  my  ua   mojo  useragent  new  my  request_p    ua  get_p  'https   perlcon eu '    then  sub   print shift  res  code   " n"       mojo  promise  all  request_p   wait    but when using subprocess  #  usr bin env perl use strict  use mojo  promise  use mojo  ioloop  subprocess  use mojo  useragent  my  subprocess   mojo  ioloop  subprocess  new   subprocess  run  sub   my  subprocess   shift  my  ua   mojo  useragent  new  my  request_p    ua  get_p  'https   perlcon eu '    then  sub   print shift  res  code   " n"       mojo  promise  all  request_p   wait    # stdout show 200 code return 1     sub   print "done  n"        subprocess  ioloop  start unless  subprocess  ioloop  is_running 
my plan was to factor out the important bit of  json_has  and reuse that to decide whether to spit out an alternative message 
i created a sample app with a test to demonstrate this problem  http   nragaz com rest example zip the gemfile is simple   again  setting up the initializer manually in config environments test rb works 
#95 satisfies my use cases 
i looked further into this issue and it has nothing to do with factory girl  ruby 1 9 chokes on non ascii characters by definition  i overcome this by putting  # encoding  utf 8 as the first line of every file that had non ascii characters 
last time i tried that it throwed an exception  so i did not tried it again  today it works    so this issue is not longer necessary   
hi joshua  that actually was a good tip  the error has nothing to do with factory girl  and i should have taken the advice to heart  to look if i can instantiate the object via console before filing an issue  it actually has been a misconfiguration in the mongoid mappings   sorry for bothering    cheers stefan
ah  well  i much prefer the machinist syntax  it's shorter and easier to remember what model you're actually making  with the regular factorygirl syntax  i end up with factories labeled   this_or_that_kind_of_user  instead of just  user make  some_variant   and the namespace doesn't get polluted if i want a  user make  admin  and an  address make  admin   much cleaner  i think  though i think these things could be maintained by non core factorygirl people  it'd probably turn out better if the core group maintained them since they're already deeply immersed in the codebase and will be more likely to be aware of any potential issues 
the whole hierarchy is kinda really big  but here's the  user_factory rb  https   gist github com 2403193   let me know if you need more info 
it works fine when i'm using basic model interaction but we'd like to use factorygirl    and i checked test log and there is no inserts made into the table 
thanks  i just used "bundle update"  what should i use instead of "factory"  i am so confused by docs for fg4 and old ones    
in a large project context setup is the most complicated part and it is always flipped no matter how you define it  in general  i feel like this feature gives additional flexibility to generate data with factorygirl  which is its main goal  i don't want factorygirl to decide how should i generate my context  it's my job  just want a flexible tool to do it  ### live examples  https   gist github com 5795005 https   gist github com 5795040 ### simplified version of live examples  that is too complex to show real code i am doing things from your code example about 3 times a day  in a team of 5 people it is 15 times a day average  let's take the following association chain 
thanks 
 joshuaclayton tell me what data you want   are you talking about the error   i didn't get you 
 djcp i tried that  the error persists 
thanks  i think i was over thinking it  i thought i'd need to somehow get spec factories exposed to the gem's consumer  your comment makes sense 
thank you for your response  its working now  that was probably the problem i was fiddling around with rails_helper and spec_helper  my apologies 
 joshuaclayton only one factory file in the project  this is the full output in the terminal  is that the backtrace  sorry noob here  
no  it doesn't 
it worked for my specific project  but the project uses a bunch of custom plugins  all of which would have to be updated individually  since those plugins are used by numerous products  it's not a small undertaking to modify them and make sure all products are working properly thereafter  we just went through the upgrade process from factorygirl to factorybot  and it took multiple people several days to get everything through the process  it's something we're loathe to repeat so soon 
thanks y'all 
hi  i compiled ruby from source into  programs ruby 1 9 3p194 but now that you mention that  i think that was the problem  the array rb file contained my modifications i used in ruby 1 8 7 and now that i am on 1 9 3  some things don't need to be used as is there anymore  i even defined a to_hash method there  which was the culprit     i changed that and now prawn suddenly works fine  the  pdf example was also generated  sorry for the bother     i will close this issue now 
yeah i did  maybe wait with the merge till the errors are fixed  i got a long train ride saturday  i can take a look at them during the trip if you want 
this an example of it  http   hammackj com downloads graphs pdf i wasn't aware that xpdf was unmaintained  the pdfs look great in preview evince chrome  i just got a complaint that they didn't work in xpdf and wasn't sure why 
the font file in the windows fonts folder  created a script as below 
i take that back  when i ran the test in ruby i didn't have the rc2 installed  built it and reran it in a ruby script   home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core stream rb 85 in  data'  undefined local variable or method f' for #prawn  core  stream 0x00000001c09968  nameerror  from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core reference rb 26 in  object' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core document_state rb 73 in block in render_body' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core object_store rb 74 in  block in each' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core object_store rb 73 in each' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core object_store rb 73 in  each' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn core document_state rb 70 in render_body' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document internals rb 140 in  render_body' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document rb 364 in render' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document rb 378 in  block in render_file' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document rb 378 in open' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document rb 378 in  render_file' from  home ferrio  rvm gems ruby 1 9 3 p194 gems prawn 1 0 0 rc2 lib prawn document rb 123 in generate' from test rb 3 in   main ' the ruby file  require 'prawn' prawn  document generate 'hello pdf'  do  pdf  pdf text "hello prawn "  pdf image " home ferrio rails account app assets images logo2 png"   width    105   at   0 738  end so it still errors outside of rails  so the issue isn't with prawnto  hopefully this is reopened 
 bradediger i'm working on a crude bisect to narrow down the commit  but i'm having to restart rails between each checkout  i'll get back to you     both images use  pdf image   but the logo is a path where as the the map is using  open    with a url  which afaik should be returning an io object 
if its a documentation bug  not a big deal as long as documentation gets updated    i worked around it by creating a separate font family to handle these weird cases  i'll craft a more specific failing example test script as soon as i get a chance  thanks 
pdf   prawn  document new pdf text "hello général world" mb_chars upcase pdf render_file "hello pdf"
i would extract acroform attributes of pdf form to fill with text or image 
thanks for information  to the best of my knowledge  the font is part of the issue  if i do not specify one  the issue does not occur   i also did my best to create an asciidoctor mwe  it is also astonishing to me that the printed text in the following mwe is so significant for the occurence of the error  my ruby skills are too elementary to isolate prawn from asciidoctor here  1  download  mwe zip  https   github com prawnpdf prawn files 462833 mwe zip  2  install the gem bundle 3  run  bundle exec rake book build 2  1   grep "incompatible encoding regexp"   if you see some output  you reproduced my problem  i would love to hear from someone capable of reproducing my problem  grinning

thanks  pointlessone for your response  sorry for stupid question  but how can i confirm that ligatures is lacking  generally in the text editors or word processors  the combination happens automatically  for eg  from the above example  first letter  to get  ပြည်   there sequence goes like  ပ ြ ည ်  and the word processors automatically adjusts them  1  ပ    ပ 2  ပ + ြ    ပြ 3  ပြ + ည    ပြည 4  ပြည + ်    ပြည် regards  mohan
hi  thanks for fast reply  i still see the flickering in the following situations    removing the second  screen  object from the config's  screens  list  keeping the second monitor connected   disconnecting the second monitor   xrandr  command showing only one monitor   with one  screen  object  that is  i haven't seen non flickering chrome in qtile 
i did some testing  and the sleep line did seem to make for a great work around  but just as i was writing this comment  the issue reoccurred  here's a screenshot    screenie  https   raw github com gist 3775670 b7b2bbd27ffbc5c87838b02b7b708f94b45f7206 textbox 20redraw 20error png 
yes  thanks a heap 
as a variant  yes  this code is suitable  but i still hope to find solution which uses no external tools  only default x environment  
here's my config https   bitbucket org jagguli qtile_config src 2bd949efc017 at master no idea why thats being set  i've worked around it by creating set_group hooks  might be a change in conkeror 
here's the output of  xprop  on the  wkline  window 
the current one is  exec qtile since i'm new to this project  i'd like to know the difference between qtile and qtile session    i'm going to package it into fedora  i need to understand something won't confuse people     thanks 
sorry    the code the show    i meant mod+mouse or mod+enter
on my system two of the  so filenames are slightly different so i'm using  libpango and libpangocairo should have been installed through apt  i used  dpkg  l libpango 1 0 0 amd64  and  dpkg  l libpangocairo 1 0 0 amd64  to locate these files  i'm not sure if this counts as a bug or if there is a more system independent way to write this  but it's a step beyond the documented installation instructions i had to take 
yes     you beat me to it   i was just committing the same fix  i'll still make a pr  as i have added some tests 
oh  i didn't know about that  but there's more  when i set the opacity value of the color to something  it looks like the color were translucent  but there were a black solid background behind it  so  for example  #ff0000 results in a bright red background  but #ff0000 2 gives a very dark red  as opposed to the almost invisible transparent red i want  
 frostidaho from what i understand  they seem to be just fine  internal setup 
 ramnes no  i have explicitly  cursor_warp   false   also i did check with default config  where it is  false  as well   and i have just checked with  cursor_warp   true   just to be sure   and it doesn't influence my problem in any way 
 qtile python3 git 2645 5ec03621 1   i got this behavior using "xterm" 
not sure why exactly  but modifying the desktop file to be the following seems to do the trick   i _think_ it's the inclusion of the  desktopnames  field  anyway  this can be closed now i think  thank you

yeah  exactly  thank you 
the two methods need other two parameters     move_floating dx  dy  curx  cury      resize_floating dw  dh  curx  cury   on  lazy window move_floating x  y   is sent only two parameters  on  libqtile window  there are the functions on the lines  1327 1333    i don't know why need to pass 4 parameters to the function  because it uses only two  so  when i tryed  keybinding  qtile cmd or via qshell   just not worked  two parameters missing 
yup  if i xrandr back down to one screen and restart qtile  then things work as expected 
i have it installed  but i do not know how to make an error file  i ran it in a command window  the configuration file in my home i do not have it and i tried it with the one that comes by default anyway it gives me configuration error in the bar below  maybe it's a problem of compiling python in debian
only notices that some optional libs are missing  wifi etc 
yes  i update qtile  but that was a while ago  anyway i just started zathura and it has the same problem  so it looks like this is not a qtile problem  this issue can be deleted i guess 
sorry  i don't use qtile anymore  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ original message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ on friday  march 13  2020 2 57 pm  tycho andersen  notifications github com  wrote 
step three at the bottom  http   docs qtile org en latest manual install index html it says to create a  glue shell   but the file it's referencing is specific to  venv   i e   activate   i'm not sure there's an equivalent in  conda  
it generates "config error"  i think i'm setting up the widget but still my config breaks  tho running "python  m py_compile    config qtile config py" it doesn't says that a made any mistake in my config  but still my config breaks   here  https   gist github com godnyx f943b93af25b5de9ffd59159dae56752  is my config 
dj uses yaml serialization  i think the problem was some where in the serialization of one of the syntax nodes  i don't have the stack traces on hand atm  i could construct a test case  it was creating log entries over 6k lines long for each failed job  the error happend when i called from_addrs  adam
i ended up just connecting over localhost 25 instead of using the send process  probably not worth investigating if it's working on your end 
i'm newbie in ruby but if it helps i have added some tests  https   github com aleshgo mail commit 7c45dc48a84cea836b886b005b5b416d3ab4c956
hi  ahorek  thank you for your response  some software is known to modify convert messages in a subtle way  e g by converting the transfer encoding to 7bit  quoted printable  or base64  or removing trailing spaces   it doesn't matter for many users because the meaning of the message is preserved  the message will be delivered  and will be readable  that said  when you're going to sign your message with open pgp  and probably some other tools as well   you got another problem  such alterations typically invalidate the signature  for this reason  both rfc 1847 "security multiparts"  and rfc 3156 "mime security with openpgp"  make restrictions on transfer encoding  they require that the signed message part is encoded either as quoted printable or base64  and has no trailing spaces  and this is the only reason why i want to force the transfer encoding of my choice  the problem is explained in detail in rfc 3156 section 3 "content transfer encoding restrictions"  and somewhat in rfc 1847 section 2 1 "definition of multipart signed"    https   tools ietf org html rfc1847   https   tools ietf org html rfc3156
ok  will do in the coming week  thanks  jeremy 
thanks for the explanation  eugeneius   jeremy i can try get you the specific test case on monday  or  at least  a minimal reproduction   i'll see if i can come up with something now  but i don't have a development environment of any sort for this on my personal machines 
hi   jeremy  thanks for the quick response  i just tried both 2 7 1 and 2 8 0 edge and the problem is still reproducible on both  if my reading of https   github com mikel mail pull 1062 is correct  it only added support for the utf 7 binary encoding and not the utf 7 quoted printable encoding 
i just updated to the latest git and it's still there     
big help  put the django toolbar in 1st on middlewareclasses  now it works fine all over
not sure if you got my emails or not  i can't see them here   but anyway  this is the error message i get  template error in template  library python 2 6 site packages django_debug_toolbar 0 8 4 py2 6 egg debug_toolbar templates debug_toolbar base html  error at line 49 caught attributeerror while rendering  'template' object has no attribute 'origin' 39   div  40    for panel in panels    41    if panel has_content    42  div id "   panel dom_id   " class "panelcontent"  43  div class "djdebugpaneltitle"  44  a href "" class "djdebugclose"    trans "close"     a  45  h3    panel title safe     h3  46   div  47  div class "djdebugpanelcontent"  48  div class "scroll"  49    panel content safe    50   div  51   div  52   div  53    endif    54    endfor    55  div id "djdebugwindow" class "panelcontent"   div  56   div  57
it just doesn't load  it never did on 1 8 0  then it did on 1 8 1  then it stopped when we updated to 1 8 2  i looked around and found some questions on stack overflow that mentioned changing to order of apps that load  and i tried that and it didn't help  if there's something specific we should be doing to get this to work under gae  any direction would be greatly appreciated 
yes  this fixes the problem  very clever and clean fix 
hehe  that's it  this is from an admin page  everything in there is from 'django'  which is excluded from the trace…
thanks  this has done the trick  i guess there were stale _ pyc_ files hanging around   
thank you for the reponse  no errors that i could see in the console  upon further re testing today  the problem appears to have gone away  the only thing i've done is removed and re added the app in my settings file  haven't rebooted or done anything to my browser  chrome appears to be the same version still and i haven't upgraded anything 
no errors  and i just tested with master branch and still same issue 
i can check  but is there a separate way to disable the profiling panel apart from disabling debug_tool bar in installed_apps  also  i can provide a back trace of the occurrence if you're curious 
perhaps a note in the documentation regarding using the toolbar with projects using javascript libraries that define their own global  require  function would be a good idea  the warning could describe the above solution  i'll submit a pull request if i get a chance to work on this 
no  this is not a error  just warnning but it cause http 500  the last few lines like 
ok  page show is   aaaa  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3354923 9127445 cdfdab36 3ced 11e5 877b 0cf9f11d5658 png  the request is    bb  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3354923 9127633 32e106b8 3cf0 11e5 951b ae7a6530253e png 
that's what's recommended in the documentation  http   django debug toolbar readthedocs org en latest installation html#quick setup adding gzip to that and setting  debug  to  false  will cause the exception 
which code did you use 
 matthiask yes  that fix works  thanks for suggesting it 
i am using chrome version 73 0 3683 103  build officiel   64 bits  this is the latest version  i have the same problem on safari  on ubuntu 18 04 with chrome   firefox the problem is the same
ok got it thanks for link 
i'll check  but can you provide more information about what to look for

i am on ubuntu 8 
sorry for such a bug with so little information  yes i am using linux  i am a new developer for source mage gnu linux distribution  i work mostly on simple updates of the packages  so i updated my version of pyqt to 4 6 and checked if anything that depend on it broke  soon i realised that cola is not working  i tried to recompile where i got that message  you can find full compile log here  http   www pyrobor si linux cola 1 3 9 14   but strangly it doesn't break the build  but when if i try to run git cola i get  the cola gui modules have not been built  try running "make" in the cola source tree  tell me how to make traceback in compile and i will make it 
if i open repo  click into commit message editor immediately  then i can type  also  following a stage  the commit message editor continues to work fine  it only fails if i open a repo  stage files immediately  and then try to add a commit message 
doh  i totally forgot to check my version and inform you what my environment was  i'm running v1 4 3 5 on ubuntu 12 04 64bit  i assumed that i was running a late version since i installed it several weeks ago  turns out that the version available by apt get is rather out of date your commits do fix the problem so this is resolved 
thanks  but it does not help  the git code starts always with german language  how my operation system 
 alt+ctrl+0  seems like a good suggestion  though it's probably a good idea to check with someone who uses the bindings regularly  and on other os's  
sorry it was merely a suggestion i am no artist  i use git cola every day on ubuntu though and love it   the icon just seems a little outdated 
awesome  git cola keeps getting better and better 
 davvid no  i am proposing integrating the whole git deps web ui 
hi  davvid  on the time of opening this issue   latest commit on master was 59e686e099abe0a3ff7da7e35e9bc8ca0d1b4b39  i can confirm  that build from this commit still reproduces described issue  however current latest commit from the master 4409089292cbdf86282c54a4b7e95d2d8e48f3fb doesn't have the defect anymore  so  we can close this issue  i think  anyway  to prevent such a case for new users in future   i would still put a step with  git checkout  on latest stable and tested version 
sorry about opening such issue here  do you know how can i contact the fedora package's maintainer 
yes  this exactly  changes to "this repository" are preserved  while changes to "all repositories" reset as soon as i move to a different tab in "preferences" window   davvid   i will try to check what you describe 
i made it public now  https   github com armandg aasenit
the revert fixed it  the "success" list comes from calling table   on the query table  for some reason  we decided to make table   return a string instead of being void  i don't think fitnesse does anything with the result  so changing table   to not return anything also fixes the problem  however  i'm guessing a similar problem will occur if the query method returns list with an element that has    in it  see https   github com gshakhn fitnesse commit da9bf793bc1d4b01551e6f94ecacfb14f3e23835 for a test case 
not sure why you say hundreds of rows is fishy  we switched to slim few months ago but this issue is common in both  this is a very common use case  all of our tests had to be refactored to smaller tests  had been trying to resolve this since a year now  yahoo groups never responded 
sorry i forgot to include that  but i'm using 20130531
my apologies    my fault  i hadn't bothered to run all the other suiteacceptancetests is a while    i should have  the entire suite ends similarly and it's because i renamed the jar  this issue should be rejected closed 
just a lot of stuff  such as json serialized documents and ensuring that certain elements are in there via regexs   
we have a lot of templates  some are generic global to the entire suite and some are scoped to specific suites  there are about 15 generic templates so far and can be another 15 20 specific to another suite  our goal is to have a template per fixture as documentation to qa of our available fixtures 
hi linquize  sorry  not very familiar with github   i've opened https   github com unclebob fitnesse pull 422  cheers
hi apologies for not checking this before stirring things up  indeed i have used older version of fitnesse 
thanks for your help and sorry for the delayed response on this  it looks like the issue was just in the weird version  not sure how that happened  a more recent one fixed the problem  if it's still of any interest  the memory usage would grow to a normal size at the start of the test and then spike right at the end  after the test was finished  memory usage would not decrease  running the test multiple times did not cause the memory to spike as dramatically at the end but did increase memory usage over time  again  the newer version of fitnesse fixed the issue so it's probably not an issue any more 
this happens in every single search i run  title or content based  whenever the search is complete  that seems to be the pattern   this does not occur when doing a properties based search  which i thought was kind of peculiar 
our problem is  everybody can create new pages on the root level  for example  this fitnesse instance works with fitnesse ldap authenticator    fitnesserio  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9351430 5200214 860629b8 754a 11e4 9402 191623091136 jpg  i don't have access on frontpage  but i could create this page  http   fitnesserio ep petrobras com br 8080 helloworld   fitnesseriohelloworld  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9351430 5200252 1abed88e 754b 11e4 84ad b5da61de5bcf jpg  we need to know how to protect non authorized user to create new pages on this environment  thank you  regards  lívia
good to know but i haven't tried yet 
it's bombing at this point     any ideas from that 
i managed to get it working by changing the method name to   public boolean checkifsorted list  string   values    so  this is definitely looks like a method naming issue  i would like to know the rules and why   issorted   cannot be found by slim system 
 six42 for example  if im testing a list of apis using the restfixture  i'd like to pass a root urls using a properties file so that they're all in one place  i could define them all in the root but i'd prefer them outside of fitnesse files  currently  i've added them into  plugins properties  but was just wondering if there's a way to pass multiple properties files to fitnesse so that fitnesse plugins config and my properties are separated out 
yes 
to ensure highly available sut and abstract the web server from running the test  it's not a big issue but is nice to have    i'm can think of some workaround to do it but i want to know first if fitnesse slim support it out of the box 
we are using our fixtures  included on classpath   so i suppose it will be translated to symbols  right now i increased heap to 8gb and looking what is happening there  for you request   i will try   
i have defined vm arguments in the command_pattern on the root page of fitnesse  what i want to do is i want to override those arguments before running every test page on the front page of fitnesse   tcnh
unfortunately not  but i came to a similar conclusion  however it's pretty much unclear _which_ page is wrongly formatted   
but how to rename them one by one with code  not manually  i've read the fitnesse code  but still not found simple way to do this 
all hundreds of  other cases passed  except this one

that works a treat matt  ta 
i can't see any error message  but if i use   out 'features  report html' in cucumber yml  i got "features" instead of "features report html" i means i want to use whitespace in the filename and the directory  e g   at a result  the report will be generate in "c  test"
i have tested on linux and mac os with ruby 1 9 2 p290  the path which the error ocurred were    Área de trabalho project  
i know  in this patch was applied  the whole constantize method could be refactored away  replaced by  eval arg    to me it was most important to illustrate the problem and a solution  the rest of the code i constantize is doing some input argument sanity validation  actually i would like to see a patch could turn the variable  constant  into the fully qualified constant name including the prefix  cucumber  formatter     for built in formatters   so basically i would like to see a better patch than the one provided by me  anyone 
yes   i saw those timeout settings in code  however the error is coming from line 35 here  https   github com cucumber cucumber blob master lib cucumber wire_support connection rb#l35 in which there is no timeout config being passed in  therefore the timeout defaults to 3 seconds

i've brought it up with the pry team via this issue  https   github com nixme pry nav issues 14 i happen to use the step function of pry manually more often than the step function of cucumber  simply because when debugging cucumber code using pry  i'd like to be able to step  this is probably the behavior of other developers who use both projects  keep in mind that cucumber runs fine using step during normal execution  it's only when binding pry is placed that there exists a problem  this problem of namespace collision isn't unique to pry and cucumber  and it's a bigger problem that the ruby community needs to solve as a whole  but perhaps a good band aid would be to create a function called cucumber_step  and have step call cucumber step  and have a parameter passed to cucumber somehow to optionally not define the step function  for users who don't pass the option  cucumber operates the same way  otherwise  step wouldn't be defined and there would be no collision 
oh i'm sorry  this issue was for my application  i didn't realize i wasn't in the right repository when i posted it  i'm taking it down now  sorry 
my apologies  this is irrelevant for the ruby cucumber 
 mattwynne i'm a little short on time but i'll try  i've got some other projects to maintain and i'm trying to get them all ready for when i show up to cukenfest 
this issue happens when launching displaying ssh command  which generates some utf8 output  the ssh command is launched via open3 ruby library  operating system  fedora18 afaik something similar happened  when inside the step  there was an attempt to get web page with  curl http        which had used utf8 formatting  when i get more information  i will put it here 
hi  sorry for the delay in response  i have been away from work  i found the problem   i had previously setup  rspec autorun  as a dependency  in part to clean up the stacktrace on an error  see https   gist github com brass kazoo 8588975   this is largely unnecessary now and have removed it  i suppose that autorun's exit hook code is what is actually causing the error message  and not cucumber  teamcity is now running and reporting on the tests properly 
this is a problem with the released gem  i have not tried testing with master it is the same issue reported at https   groups google com forum # msg cukes ysbx8qddscg fpndveipzuyj basically  when the proc is called the first time  the test runs just fine  each subsequent run the steps all get printed to console as if the test is executing  but the actual step definitions are not exercised  i have verified this through debug logging as well as some cursory work with the debugger 
in  #build_step step_hash    step_hash  multiline_arg   was  nil  in v1 3
hi matt  because sometimes the  visit  method works as expected  meaning my variable is www assembla com and it redirects me there but sometimes it adds this text   content index m php  with apparently no reason and randomly  i don't know what's causing this  do you have any idea 
okay   brasmusson the cukenfest is june 21st   25th  so maybe you want to release cucumber 3 0 0 during the event term  right  i saw your guys' face photos in the event page  it is in london  it's close from my living country czech republic     though i won't attend the event  i hope the event's success  😄
no  i don't have the syntax gem
thanks for the quick reply  the test case you brought up is structurally the same  however  there are two differences    in the test case i linked the insert is done using a prepared statement   in the test case i linked autocommit is turned off i think both differences are valid uses of odbc  if you follow the link you find two code examples  one with sqla  the other with plain pyodbc  i am reposting the example with plain pyodbc here 
 mkleehammer it is server for testing purposes  but anyway i replaced username and password in text to strings with same length  all other information is relevant  https   gist githubusercontent com pentusha cfacb9f4c24842fcf8fd0726a2291eb0 raw 44a73ab6f49e16b22108331a7df0e5b07c702306 odbc_trace_format log https   gist githubusercontent com pentusha cfacb9f4c24842fcf8fd0726a2291eb0 raw 44a73ab6f49e16b22108331a7df0e5b07c702306 odbc_trace_parameterized log
i'm afraid the version from  fix199  doesn't seem to work in my case  minimal setup to reproduce the issue  1  create virtualenv  do  pip install uwsgi pyodbc   2  create  wsgi py  file with   5  run the server   uwsgi   ini uwsgi ini   http socket 0 0 0 0  two things i figured  seems like  enable threads  is irrelevant  the issue also reproducible with python 3 4 
yes  these are older servers  can i get one of the older versions out of pipit 
 gordthompson thank you for confirming that sql is passed to the driver  i just run multi values insert in native netezza client and got exact same undescriptive error "42000 27 error  found " "  at char 49  expecting a keyword"  you are correct netezza sql is not sql 92 compliant and this is not an pyodbc issue 
i work on both platforms but files are stored in windows server and the script is going to work on windows server also 
iodbc remains the default in macos   as of 10 13 3  https   opensource apple com release macos 10133 html   apple did stop shipping their home grown  odbc administrator app  some while ago  and told us  i e   openlink  that they would encourage users to shift to the  iodbc administrator app   and  iodbc administrator64 app   which we had provided from day one  apple never did ship the frameworks build of iodbc  for reasons we were never told  which remains surprising and frustrating  as many significant apps  not least being microsoft office  build against and require the frameworks  they cannot operate with just the dylibs    which also means they cannot run with just unixodbc  in its standard build  your comment about "the open source unixodbc" suggests that you may not realize that  iodbc  http   www iodbc org   is also open source and is also  here on github  https   github com openlink iodbc   iodbc and unixodbc are generally api equivalent from the application and driver perspective  iodbc has full macos native ui implementation  and has since roughly mac os 9 0   which differs from unixodbc  homebrew and macports projects do tend to have different variants for linking to iodbc vs unixodbc  because these are built on each user's machine  and the user might prefer to link to frameworks vs dylibs  or to dylibs in   usr lib  vs   lib   once built  the binaries don't usually care  as long as the library names and locations are consistent  as they are in a default environment  you building against iodbc  whether frameworks or dylibs  does not limit user choice of drivers in any way  foss and commercial drivers alike build and work fine  with no cost for use of the iodbc sdk 
django error  find attached the odbc trace  sql log  https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc files 1794261 sql log  schema  the table is called dbo parserdb2_question so the schema would be dbo

just about 1000 rows  i don't know the question should belong to sybase or pyodbc 
sure    odbc log  https   github com mkleehammer pyodbc files 2105296 odbc log  contains the trace from running above test script a single time

 v chojas i am unable to get odbc trace  because i am unable to restart the python process only running inside a container in a kubernetes pod  meanwhile here is odbcinst  j output
python don't know '  ' basicaly  so have to expand it using 'expanduser' function  it expand '  ' to real path  ex    homebrew include      users reznoa homebrew include
i did try that and i know what kind of problems does it solve however in these cases it didn't help it's strange because the exact same query works perfectly with database administration software but with pyodbc it only works after i start removing parts of the query  i kept on experimenting for hours and i couldn't reach any reasonable conclusion on what exactly is causing these errors other than the query being "complex" 
i have tried using both python 3 4 5 and python 3 5 on opensuse 42 1 latest version of unixodbc  2 3 4 currently  i have microsoft's official linux drivers installed for sql server 11  13 and 17  trying to run this program against any of them results in a segmentation fault  when running the program locally on my windows machine using sql server native client 11 0  and either python 3 4 or 3 5  it does not result in a segmentation fault 
will do  working on a good example now   it seems my trivial one doesn't reproduce so there may be additional complexities here that i'm trying to track down  not sure if i'll be able to get an odbc trace for you since i'm not an admin but i'll speak w  our dbas and see what i can do  on tue  feb 26  2019 at 9 49 am v chojas  notifications github com  wrote 
 v chojas and  v makouz   thanks a lot for your responses and suggestions  i updated my password as  password   ' xxxxx ' removed the port from connect   call  my new code looks like this   import pyodbc server   'xxxxxx database windows net' database   'xxxx’ username   'xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx com' password   ' xxxxxxxx ' driver   ' odbc driver 17 for sql server ' conn_str    'driver '+driver+' server '+server+ ' database '+database+' uid '+username+' pwd '+ password   connection   pyodbc connect conn_str  'driver  odbc driver 17 for sql server  server 'xxxxxx database windows net database edw uid xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx com pwd  xxxxxxxx  '   the error still continues 
unfortunately not  the code is closed source and the query is closely coupled with the database design  not something that could be easily reproduced 
upgrading unixodbc to 2 3 7 indeed fixed the issue  you're awesome 
thanks for the very quick response  a setting of this sort would be great for me as i only ever need 1  the last  result set  in the meantime  i have worked around the issue by just re connecting with a modified version of the the injected conn string to have the database that i need  just posted issue here in case others come across this 
this is from an install of pypy3 6 downloaded in the last 2 3 days right off the pypy site  pyodbc should work with pypy  correct  thanks  m
so i just realized that i was ignoring disregarding warning messages in ssms  which  i believe  results in cursor not being a query and pyodbc throwing programmingerror "no results  previous sql was not a query " the warning  warning  null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other set operation  set ansi_warnings off solved the issue  therefore it's not a bug  thank you both 
character encoding of connection string is utf 8 and server locale setting is en_us utf 8
i can give you a full trace tomorrow  the error occurs in   usr lib64 ruby gems 1 8 gems friendly_id 2 2 0 lib friendly_id rb 65 in  has_friendly_id'
all is working perfectly with 2 2 5  many thanks for your responsiveness 
2 2 5 rake task was updated with   script generate friendly_id   skip migration i miss something 
seems to be working in 2 3 0  sorry about that   
 norman that make sense  my workaround is the same  i won't be able to tackle this anytime soon but agree with you on supporting any character type field as primary key   thumbsup 
yes i did  rails  initializer run do  config      config gem "friendly_id"     end apparently rails is not able to find the gem  though it is installed and called  gem list   local     friendly_id  2 3 4 
thanks for your quick answer here is a complete app that illustrate the problem http   github com cyrille speciality just run a console and run speciality create   title    "toto"  several times and you see the errornomethoderror  undefined method  friendly_id_config' for nil nilclass bty i've just discovred that if you don't have cached_slug it's working  maybe a hint of the issue 
i dug into the code of both versions and it seems that the misunderstanding is from my side  if i remember correctly then the older version first queried all appropriate record based on the slug and then filtered the collection based on the scope  this allowed to evaluate the instance methods of those records returned by the initial query  in the new code it does things differently   it queries the records based on the slug and scope right away  which is clearly more efficient   so if i understood it correctly then its impossible to do what i described before  it also does not make much sense and "accidentally" worked before   
there are multiple types of users  the foreign key on the productions table is user_id  the abstractuser class uses  set_table_name  to make the database table just "users"
hmmm    where do i see what version is supported with 2 3  on the homepage  i e  readme md  it says "friendlyid is compatible with active record 2 3 x and 3 0 " and "friendlyid will continue to support 2 3 x until rails 3 1 is released " i don't think rails 3 1 is out    is it 
the friendly id is generated automatically from  say a page title  the page's title is controlled via cms by a client  they named their page  say something somethingrelated    i don't have control over what they do  should i tell them not to use slashes  i mean    it just makes an unreadable url #   " somethingsomethingrelated"     why can't i have it make "something somethingrelated" 
hey norman  i have not solved it but i made a hack to fix it  going directly into mysql code   the bug still exist but i can report it again when i get back to the issue  right now i can't  sorry  christoffer 2011 10 11 norman clarke   reply reply github com  ##
yes  saved the post with friendly_id  the code that is generating this query is the following 
hrmm    that may be a fair assessment  i guess i am trying to achieve something like this  http   stackoverflow com questions tagged  net how do i allow the tag name   slug to be   net   likewise  how would i go about achieving that with  c#   i can see that so does it by doing  c 23    but which helper method in the view would i use to convert the name  c 23  to  c#  
confirmed rc1  here is the output   and get the same issue 
philip  yes  this is debatable  i opened a pull request to rails rails#12663 that uses blank  instead of the nil     empty   they are using now  but one of the initial comments on this was that the rails docs state that to_param returns a string  it is cleaner to adhere to the specifications of a function 
happy new year  compay  so it turns out that  as usual  i was wrong  ftr the versions i'm using are rails 4 1 6 and friendly_id 5 0 4  my mistake was trying to regenerate the slug for a case  without having populated the  friendly_id_slugs  table for every existing record before  so now  with an empty  friendly_id_slugs  table i ran this in the console   that populated the history table with the current slugs  after that  regenerating a slug worked fine and took my 2nd ption from the  slug_candidates   before it wasn't able to find the existing conflicting slug because it didn't exist in the history table yet  although it existed in the cases table   here's for a great 2015  cheers  ps  i decided to keep my dependency with 5 0 4 because it's the latest stable  should i really upgrade to 5 1 0 beta1 even being a beta  is 5 0 4   that   buggy

thanks for you quick response  i try to comment out  require 'init ido  it still can't not work correcttly  after i added ' current language environment "chinese gbk"  everything work great  thanks you config is really great 
hi  thanks  it works   but i got some unexpected issues  probably no related to this software  the global performance of my laptop got affected  it's got slowed down  so slow  it takes long seconds to react and operating  so i had to remove the  emacs d file and starting again  
24 3 on both of them 
yes it dose but some codes added to ini locales el are to be a failure do you have some better way to solve this case 
i am on windows there   
i have no ideal  i will check this tommow  may becouse the version of orgmode i used  steve purcell notifications github com于2015年7月1日周三 下午1 44写道：
yes  i did not install git  i never used it  my emacs seems performs well after git bing installed  thank you 
emacs version  25 1 1 system  x86_64_centos6 5 yes is it  using in in terminal 
 earthisaprisonifyounotawareitcannotout see this  https   github com purcell emacs d blob master lisp init folding el
i don't make any change to the configuration  i just turn up the emacs and c x c f a new file  with m x makefile mode  it's good when i just edit the file with tab  but when i save it with c x c s  the tab just become to 8 whitespces 
yes  i tried to restart emacs and it still doesn't work  then i delete  emacs d and get a new copy by 'git clone'  however  the issue is still there 
it is gnu emacs  i started it by   nw  i'm on   macos high sierra 10 13 3  
i picked some dot el file in lisp directory for myself in emacs configuration  function named kill back to indentation is provided by init editing utils  i write hahah some whitespace   and then invoke this function  it kills the whole line  emacs version  gnu emacs 26 1
yeah  it works with your updated repo  thank you for taking time to fix this minor issue  would you briefly explain  for someone who knows little about emacs  how you solve the issue  besides  you suggested  in https   github com purcell exec path from shell #setting up your shell startup files correctly  that "config files should therefore set the environment variables to their exact desired final values"  but  that can be out of some users' control  in my bash_profile  for example  there is "export path " users zhfu anaconda2 bin  path"  which is automated added by anaconda2 installer  apparently 
if you believe it's a bug  then i can try attacking it from that angle  i just wanted to make sure i wasn't doing something dumb 
 troessner thanks 
 mvz i'm using it through rubycritic  which isn't up to date to the latest releases  anyhow  giving how similar they are i think my threshold question applies to both smells 
here is the method  the config reek is located at the root of my rails project where i run the  bundle exec reek  command  i'm using version 3 6 0 
no  we don't have usage statistics 
ah  that makes sense  since that method is defined in a third party gem  devise   i guess we'll have to exclude the whole controller  which removes the warning   and live with the fact that if a prima donna method is defined there  it won't be caught by reek 
 rkh there is no way to upgrade even to 1 1 for me   
passenger 3 0 5
still happens with the current master  i will try to reduce it to a simple test case and update the issue 
ok  thanks 
i use rack 1 6 0  the test jodosha 416aade700d258581d58fb9c5046e0f86129c09e passes successfully  but the test aingvarf d0b636c979c2aebfcea10144557b788680391ade fails  ie sends second post request with auth data and empty content  but set header content type equal to firtst unauthorized request and content length   0  i suppose that parsing content should be avoided if header content length   0 
when fips mode is enabled on a machine it does not know that it is used for check sums  the fact that any time md5 is called  regardless of its use  the system will reject the call 
all i did was update rack from 2 0 8 to 2 1 0  ran the specs and got some failures  there was some middleware involved in my real case scenario  yes  however  i managed to get a minimum example to reproduce the issue to provide that here w o any middleware and so on so that you can check that w o having to dig into a bigger app and stuff     i don't think it's the responsibility of a middleware to get the content length right  but rather the server  however as there was nothing in the changelog about such change for 2 1 0  i would put that as a regression 
looks like it's  this  https   github com rack rack pull 1034  and i've misunderstood the original pr comment on our internal repo    leading to the erroneous conclusion none of the statuses work  we used   error  which as you say is incorrect  and used to get 500  switching to   internal_server_error  works and tests pass 
i tried with master because it's where i spotted new pending_timeout option

we're building ruby and the gems using just visual studio  on the command line  without using mingw32 or cygwin  i know that's not the most highly supported platform  but our situation does not allow for us to rely on those helper libraries 
ruby 1 9 2p136  2010 12 25 revision 30365   x86_64 darwin10 6 0  but it also happens with a relatively recent rbx head
the memory use does increase regardless of  objectspace each_object   but i see your point  i actually first came across this because a small sinatra app running on thin  fine on unicorn  would bloat to 500mb ram overnight  this is what i ended up tracing it to  i believe evanphx has submitted a patch for this issue 
it happens more often now  so pls help  it's hard to describe the bug fully but there are some infos that you can imagine it starts progams by  def start # cmd  programhandler and logger are predefined stdin  stdout  sterr  wait_thr   open3 popen3 cmd  eventmachine  attach stdout  programhandler  logger  end def stop # kill processes of programs that needs to stop # close stdout    end the script does stoping  starting many times and the bug happens when it starts a program or stops and starts a program again  can you help to fix this thanks

ruby 1 9 3 mri finally i figured out a small example script    i am tracking the beginning and the end of  cleanupsockets  calls  "cleanup   " and "done  n" together with flushes  this        returns nothing but "cleanup   " for me  so the unbound connection somehow interrupts in a way i did not expect  this seems to be the reason for the described "concurrency" issue  because in nested calls  my unbind called  em attach   do i miss something

i first tried the  github pages  gem  jekyll and liquid bundled in it  and found that none of its version works  it was first released at sept 2013   i then tried to find some anchor points  as follows  works    jekyll  0 12 0  + liquid  2 6 0    jekyll  0 12 1 + liquid  2 6 0  not work    jekyll  1 1 2  + liquid  2 5 4    jekyll  1 3 1  + liquid  2 5 4   the latest combination  the test source is my blog repo and relevant  post_url  tags are highlighted in the this diff  https   github com hupili hupili github com commit d1fea8bdfd30e3fd0b4e0c83e2fcebbde7b00f45 jekyll locks particular liquid versions in recent releases and i don't know how to try more combinations  what i know from a user's point is that my github pages used to build successfully  without changing anything it fails to build recently and the complaint is that  post_url  can not find those posts  the  github pages  gem was also released recently and all versions fail so i don't know what versions they use previously  the real problem is probably the inter work of jekyll and liquid  i'm not ruby developer and find it inefficient for me to trace further  i put the issue to liquid because it was the direct source of error message  it will be very helpful if you can locate the real cause and redirect it to the corresponding project 
hm  why do you think that val should only be string       etc  val   liquid drop  correct me if i wrong   if i use a liquid_methods in my models it will automatically generate liquid drop class  proxy  for instances of this class  in this case i can add  length to liquid_methods and it will return length property of my model 
please consider it a feature request then 
oh  gosh  you are right   i forgot the "s" at the end of  code strip_newlines  code   sorry for bothering you  but it would be really great if this could be clarified in the documentation  https   github com shopify liquid wiki liquid for designers   there it says     code strip_newlines  code    strip all newlines   n  from string maybe better would be     code strip_newlines  code    strip all newlines   n  or   r n  from string and another thing i'd love being included somewhere is that you can use both single and double quotes  like in javascript  for filtering  this can be important if you want to refer to single or double quotes in a filter string  e g  replace all double quotes with a single quote   code replace  '"'  "'"  code   or is it possible to use backslashes there  e g   code replace  '"'  ' ''  code  
the one installed with shopify  so no idea it happens on our shopify site we are developing here is a link https   vinoteque myshopify com collections nederburg products nederburg the brew master by nederburg 2011 notice the title of the product
i think that they used on purpose a non standard timezone  hence the 'weird' adjective in the debian bug report  
i'll look that up  i actually am using a service that uses "liquid tags"  the code i pasted is my interface to their service  i'll ask them for the "actual code"

 salexzee   thank you for following up  yes  correct that is what i have used to solve this issue for time being but according to shopify documentation and experts this is not a good practice  we should be always be using  asset_url  for all the assets files within style sheet  you can get more reference from  comment  https   ecommerce shopify com c ecommerce design t images url s in the style css file 109049#comment 109130  of  jamies on shopify forum  lets say in near future  if shopify implements some folder structure or other thing for images and scss then it might break our style sheet 
let's just chalk the problem up to my general level of retardation   my pandoraone subscription expired  thus i was denied access to the higher quality stream  once i paid  the problem was "solved"  not sure why i didn't receive a notice    i'll have to dig around in my junk mail  apologies for the bother  at least maybe someone else will see this when encountering the same "problem"   b
awesome  the debs don't work on 10 04 yet because the libfaad has been moved 
sure  one thing i would like to do with it is send the current song to an irc channel  how i do so in shell i will figure out   i would like to have a hotkey instead of doing so every time the song changes because i skip music a lot and it would be spammish if everytime the song changes it got sent  another possible use case would be to download the album art and open it  thanks 
how would i know which version i'm running promyloph   i used sudo apt get install pianobar so i assume it would be the latest one
i'm not sure    it's worked for the past several songs pianobar has played  is there a way i can have pianobar tell me what kind of files it's playing 
i was mostly thinking about situations wherein  for example  i was out of the room or something for the first part of a song i really like  or something  but as you say  that's not really how pandora's set up to work  so fair enough     
how can i tell which libao backend i am using  how can i change it 
thanks  login now works  after i select a station i get the following error       select station  18    station "the beatles radio"  205760935311199805   i  receiving new playlist    error  playlist end  and it doesn't play  not sure if it is related

it's a hack if you consider the distortion a bug  you could call it a "digital boost support" feature for the libpiano  clearly it is not a feature for the pianobar front end  if that's the case then that code is the right path  0 is 100   volume down seems to have some sort of logarithmic slope that never actually reaches 0   although at 42 its pretty dead  so the question is  is it a bug  or a feature 
sorry  posted this in the wrong thread  will move to pianopub 
how do i access that response body 
well   that's weird  making it with  g caused it to not segfault  and after removing  g  make clean    make  it still works 
is there a way to remove those keyboard shortcuts completely  that way i can see if it's my script sending in strange characters  on mar 25  2012 7 03 am  "promyloph"   reply reply github com  wrote 
i applied the patch  and got this error now   i  receiving new playlist    network error  unknown http status code  it hangs on that  i think perhaps if there's an error  it would be better if it exited instead of hanging  so the script can sleep for a few seconds  and reconnect  i'm not sure if the error is because of a hiccup at pandora  or my network 
sorry   just a standard port install of pianobar v2012 05 06 itself    sudo port install pianobar      computing dependencies for pianobar      fetching archive for pianobar      attempting to fetch pianobar 2012 05 06_0 darwin_11 x86_64 tbz2 from http   packages macports org pianobar  snip    pianobar welcome to pianobar  2012 05 06   press   for a list of commands   i  login    ok   i  get stations    ok   snip 
didn't know that was possible  thank you 
registered with a new account and the new account works fine with pianobar  strange 
i get no output from  readelf  a pianobar   grep "ffmpeg"   so it appears that i am not using ffmpeg  should i  make clean  and  make  again 
if i have pianobar running while i create a new pandora station  i'm unable to play my new station until i restart pianobar  and i would like to be able to refresh it without shutting it down and having to re login again 
look at the network traffic  when i pause a song downloading stops  unpausing does not cause it to resume  when i skip a song  next  downloading continues but there is no output and pianobar shows that the current time in the song isn't moving 
turns out it was my mediocre internet 404ing
i recently installed pulseaudio so maybe it's using that  i don't have '   libao'  what do you recommend i try for default_driver 
i haven't been able to reproduce the problem until actually i opened up any type of internet browser that's when it starts causing errors like decoding error   channel coupling not yet implemented  bitstream value not allowed by specification etc  i'm not sure if that was the cause of it or not but it was working just fine when i didn't have one open if that makes any sense  another error came up where pce shall have the first element in a frame 
yes  sporadically  i'll go2 3 hours with none  then i might some bizarre spanish ad  and a few songs later  an english ad  then it seems a few songs after  it locks up  when i quit and restart  no ads for another 2 3 hours
no i can't download the songs  i just get a 0 byte file  i don't use ffmpeg

trying to emulate the control pianobar script on windows  but since windows has no fifos  i thought a socket might work just as well  it could even be just another element of your input fds   array  which you open add in main c and check in ui_readlines c  if you like  i could submit a pr

hi  tivie   thanks for getting back to me so quickly  yes  exactly currently the contents is parsed as markdown  i am indeed currently using a lang extension to workaround this problem  but i believe that it will become increasingly common to have custom elements in our html and that support for this should be built in  if you didn't want to treat all custom elements as block level  one option would be to provide users with a configurable white list of matching element names to check   
sorry  i guess i filed this too hastily  looks like it's something else in my codebase stripping them 
 tivie sorry for lack of response  happy to keep closed  essentially using the minified build  if you concat that with another script  the emoji's got broken  leaving this here incase anyone else has same problem  this was my solution in the end  to concat  then minify the build myself

not any problem to access to  constants  defined on files on the folder  billing gateways    i think is ok but the problems happen when you want to do special things like in the test i was talking about on my previous post

 jduff nice link but unfortunately not the right solution  would you guys be open to a pull request that makes gemfile eval a gemfile_local if present  this file would be ignored by git and would allow developers to add whatever dependencies they want need 
is that test hitting the stripe servers  i'm getting the error directly from stripe when the  line_items  are passed into the   options  i'm calling the  capture  method on the gateway from an authorized payment  i don't know   haven't checked if the bug also occurs on the  purchase  method  i'm using customer profiles   where  gateway_options  line_items   is present

i understand about the abstraction  and in this case would go with what the services prefer to call it  they are closer to the fis  and probably have a better handle on what things are called in the financial world  after a quick google search  it looks like   descriptor   would be better than   description    some call it billing descriptor  transaction descriptor  so  statement_descriptor  seems to me like a good choice

i don't think so  just tried it to verify   the actual database field is "description"  desc_lvl1 and desc_lvl2 are 'fakes' that i am trying to map "description" to  so i can index it in two different ways  only workaround so far is to treat them as different fields and carry two  or more  copies of this field in the database

the problem i'm trying to solve is bounding box searches that cross the 180th meridian  in the past we solved it by breaking the search into two params as you see above  if sunspot already accounts for this let me know  a solr query that works for this problem looks something like fl solr_id score qt dismax qf id 9 title 7 description 1 qs 100 fq  latlng   82 940327 59 164389 to 85 831591 180  or latlng   82 940327  180 to 85 831591  99 741861   start 0 tie 0 3 pf title 10 description 5 ps 20 wt ruby mm 2  1 5 80 25 sort status asc  score desc  updated_at desc rows 15

unfortunately  i'm not that strong in either ruby or rails  and i don't have the time at the moment to dig through the test suit and figure out all of the appropriate idioms  i pretty much only discovered this bug because redmine is affected by it  i'm more of a savvy consumer than a legit developer in that regard  that said  if i can dedicate myself to the task in the near future  i'll take a crack at it

ok thats positive  thanks  could it be to do with datetime fields  this is a sql server datetime field   is ar trying to do some coercion on it 
this is my  config database yml    it runs  activerecord  tasks  sqlserverdatabasetasks#structure_load  twice because i have two databases   payroll_employee_data_dev  and  payroll_employee_data_test   but on the second time through  it looks like  #connection  is cached from the previous run  and thus it tries to apply the schema twice to the first database 
4 2 1 i'll take a look thanks 
 chrislusted  i removed the validates of column  it's fix 
i think they are stored as datetime  the process is  that there is an input field where a string with the date is input  a save is then called on the object  what i would like to happen is than when a date is input the time is automatically set to midnight  for that particular field  i am guessing that somehow in the save action  time zone parse input_string  is used  instead of input_string to_datetime   i guess what i could do is explicitly call to_datetime on the string before save  that might actually solve my problem  would be nice to have some sort of functionality that says "don't timezone this field"  though 
happy to help  it's better  but not quite there  everything seems to say that this attribute is now _datetimeoffset_  which is great  it even will keep from changing the timezone automatically on assignment  but something is happening when i actually save the object   prior to the current change  the timezone would get casted on assignment  just to check  i also tried using the  skip_time_zone_conversion_for_attributes  method  to see if that hook is appropriate  but the behavior was the same  http   api rubyonrails org classes activerecord timestamp html

i did  you find it at  http   gist github com 609545 meanwhile i realized that the problem is not directly related to unicode math  loading fontspec instead of unicode math creates the same problem  in fact i found that it is enough to load the eu1 fontencoding  this points to a bug in xetex

that makes sense to me and would solve my problem as well 
has it been  deprecated  http   www w3 org tr html5 text level semantics html#the mark element  
i'm not sure how to answer that question  i think that you are asking what technologies are being used in this project  as far as i'm aware it's ror  bootstrap  backbone  posgresql  and haml
example for the second message 
 with leading newline   nothing specific  actually  only the     highlight html     syntax works
i did not realize that  that should be fine too 
on the first two cases  inline code scenario  which is different from code blocks  there shouldn't be any syntax highlight in the sense of "programming language syntax highlight"  instead there should only be some text formatting  a bounding box and a background  in detail the bounding box frame and text color are the same as text  while the background in that box the same color as the background color used in code blocks  and the font the same as used in code blocks  https   github com adam p markdown here wiki markdown cheatsheet#code i mean inline code doesn't get highlighted  require 'kramdown'  code blocks do
hi  my code is here on github   https   github com gregonnet blog  https   github com gregonnet blog  i use  nanoc  https   github com nanoc nanoc  which calls the kramdown library  nanoc provides a filter for  kramdown  http   nanoc ws doc reference filters #kramdown   this filter calls kramdown     view file  https   raw githubusercontent com gregonnet blog master content posts articles 2016 08 27 how to setup nanoc with guard md   i hope this helps  if there is any thing else i can help with  please let me know 
i understand now    thanks for clarifying  gettalong  time for me to go pester github i guess  that'll go well  
 gettalong i attempted to figure out what may have changed  unfortunately i've updated ruby  jekyll and all other deps  as far as expected output  i'm more of just an end user of jekyll and kramdown  so i can't really speak to that  i was able to overcome my issue with js and ids with leading numbers  and as ids with leading numbers are valid in html5  it really isn't a kramdown issue  thank you 
 gettalong there appears to have been a practice  whether or not there was a standard  see the site i linked  and many others like it  which rely on it  i would want it because i can grab the value in css with  attr     afaik  there isn't an easy way to do that with a class  language lang —or at least  not with css  i'm sure js could do it  but i don't want to write some custom js to grab all the languages and create new dom elements for each page  jquery could do it  but i don't need it otherwise and don't want the bloat   with css  it's as easy as a    before  and  content  attr 'data lang'    again  as far as i can tell  this is what  used  to be done  and i can't figure out how to make it happen for me now  worse  other folks  like the site i mentioned  seem to be making it work  but i don't know what markup hosting they're using  with github pages  i'm tied to kramdown + rouge  which i'm fine with   and i'm partial to triple backticks  because the     highlight lang     is a pain to type 
it happens after clicking install  second screen after entering shop url   openssl 0 9 8r 8 feb 2011
i cleared the browser cache and cookies  tried in ff  chrome  and safari  all reproduce the same issue  i'm running  6 0 4  on a fresh rails build using the generators 
quick question   any setting i can update so that when i refresh the browser i don't have to sign in again  seems like i'm killing the session somehow   ok  back to the issue  yes  but if you look at the gem page here  https   github com shopify shopify_app and then go down to this section  shopifyapp  sessionrepository it still has this   class shop   activerecord  base def self store session  shop   self new domain  session url  token  session token  shop save  shop id end def self retrieve id  if shop   self where id  id  first shopifyapi  session new shop domain  shop token  end end end
i'll get back to you  i am working on an app tnx
most browsers allow third party cookies  in the oauth flow  in the exchange of tokens etc  dealing with sessions  etc  there is usually also a need to write cookies  in this case  most browsers work well  however  safari by default allows no third party cookies  thus in any embedded app connection attempt  when exchanging tokens and dealing with the sessions  safaro chokes and the result is an oauth failure  labelled as csrf_detected  only by setting safari to allow cookies does the embedded app session get initialized properly

i am not validating anything in my model  you can see the code i provided  i do a shop save which triggers the correct update  but it is always preceded by that exists  which seems to be a shopify thing  perhaps from this concern  i am just curious  i see the logs  and it is on every single update inside the block shop with_shopify_session  module shopifyapp module sessionstorage extend activesupport  concern included do validates  shopify_token  presence  true validates  api_version  presence  true validates  shopify_domain  presence  true  end
hi kevin  thanks for your response  i spoke to heroku and was advised that there is an issue with  redirect_uri   i also see this error in command line  nomethoderror  undefined method redirect_uri ' for #shopifyapp  configuration 0x007f98d3bcaa98  can you advise if this is some issue with shopify_app gem  
i actually didn't change anything from base template  this is my routing 
 markiiikram  thanks for looking into it  in my case  i think it's just something that a few merchants have set on their browser  perhaps to increase privacy  or even unknowingly  often a merchant's staff will use a shared computer  on which someone changed the cookie settings at some point in time  maybe without knowledge of its purpose  so  it's difficult to track the real reason 
 alanhill when i tried to use any of the api  for example  shopifyapi  product count  then i will get that error 
thanks for that   working good 
wow  yes it's working by upgrading  activeresource  with version  activeresource     5 0 0    thanks 
actually  i determined that it works fine if you disable the embedded app functionality 
i am not using faker in a rails app   it is a simple ruby script   is enough to reproduce the problem 
it's in the project folder  so   sites project lib locales en gb yml
thanks  supremebeing7  i modify it into  gem 'faker'  '  1 6 3'   and it works 
i am using  faker 1 0 1 
perhaps writing a script to find all end points in the yml located here  https   github com stympy faker blob master lib locales en yml and calling   length  on each element to get the length of each end array could be an option 
of course  first of all  i can not use symengine pow 2 2  for example  that does not work  because there is no function pow in symengine  atleast if i do help symengine  in the python console there is no mention of the pow function  i should probably begin with two sentences  i need a fast way of transforming the symbolic function in c code the reason why i need this is  that the integrands that i construct are couple hundred lines long  and at least in sympy that takes a long time to integrate and that's why i proceed numerically from there  ok now to the c code part  i'm using ctypes to integrate a function  because this way it's much faster  for this i need to convert the function that i constructed symbolically into c code  this takes a lot of time  when i was searching for a faster way to do symbolic computation i ran into you guys  symengine is build on cpp so the code is similar to c  for example  when i do sympy exp 2  in the python console it gives exp 2   but with symengine exp 2  it's e   2   so thats already very similar to what a c function should look like  for faster integration i need the pow   function  with it i would not need the c code printer from sympy  i just could use the output of the function  i programm almost only in python  maybe i should change that  but for now and for a lot of other people that would be probably a good feature  best wishes

thanks  with 1 9 3 everything works fine  sorry that distract you 
 scambra   the first option would work for me     overriding the do_list  method and skipping pagination  thanks for the workaround 
i hacked myself up a quick solution in the active_scaffold js file by adding a few lines to delete_record_row  i just grab the next tr at the same level of the dom as the row being deleted  then if that row has a class of "inline adapter" i remove it from the dom as well  seems to work for my needs  but maybe not a very clean  or general  solution  i'll note that i noticed this issue on 3 1 6  then upgraded to 3 2 0 and still had the problem 
i just tried and i get the error even with the defaults settings for a scaffold  if active scaffold can not work without jquery ui  it could be set as a dependency  but i understand it could be problematic depending on which jquery ui version people want to use  the easiest solution would be to mention that jquery ui is needed in the readme

this is vanilla fat free crm  downloaded as the zipfile  i haven't changed anything except for the ruby version  i also  as i understand it  cannot create directories and install anything other than the gems and plugins that are part of the application setup  i doubt i can correct the path on heroku  i assume unicorn is installed as a gem on ffcrm  i didn't get any time today to look at this  i think the best thing at this stage may be to delete the application and start again

oops  i just noticed the last example of the  currency exchange  https   github com rubymoney money#currency exchange  block   seems like   it's already possible   to do what i was asking for  it didn't work for me last time i tried  maybe it was just something wrong with my code  i'll check again and re open if i find a bug   semmons99 i was talking about actually converting but behind the scenes by checking the exchange rate on the default bank  which seems like it's already been implemented 
yeah  unfortunately  #max  and  #min  are implemented in c code  here's  #max  for instance   from  https   github com ruby ruby blob 9b94249f39bff401465340639bed1f2a93b62ebf enum c i'm not familiar enough with ruby's c code to really grasp what's going wrong  i do know this code is ultimately calling  money#     though  and that this method is working as expected  i agree it's no biggy  just to ensure the array is all  money  objects before hand  that's how i'm working around it   it's just that this really caught me off guard because all the other comparison methods             etc   work fine with a mixture of  money  objects and plain numbers  the fact that  #max  and  #min  _don't_ work as expected  definitely breaks the   "rule of least surprise"    which probably isn't a good thing when working with financial transactions 
i can  but i don't really want to add a new gem  for a 3 line function  i still think that this should go in money  the current initializer is misleading and error prone    on wed  feb 4  2015 at 2 12 pm  shane emmons notifications github com wrote 
do you mean doing this in my local app like this   or can i submit a patch to rails i18n so that it is available globally for everybody  i am asking this  because i've seen that some people have submitted prs for other words in the past  but i am not sure exactly where this can be done  thanks once again 
the second example should return a eur amount  due to £0 and €0 being equal  a zero money object should not have an explicit currency and should be considered to be any currency value
ok  i looked deeper into the problem  i didn't knew you took i18n rules into account already  my current understanding is  that before you took the i18n rules into account if present  otherwise fell back to your own rules i assume  with 6 10 1   both things i ran in the bundle of my rails app  but just with irb  so i don't expect any tainting from our configuration or other gems  only  money  was explicitly required  the i18n rules are extracted from our rails app 
oh  thanks  i agree  but i think this line  can be something like 
i want to display total price and price difference from total price i don't need for minus option  ex  expadia  hotel + flight search  img width "920" alt "2019 01 01 14 43 38" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 6077520 50570567 c1ab4b80 0dd3 11e9 9571 ecac6507e5bb png" 
hi anstorm  in my app  in application rb i have deffined    if the fallback worked with the spanish translation the symbol should be the euros symbol and with my overriding it should be " " but none of those are been seen   instead with the currency set to "uyu" i seen ₱  i hope this could clarify what i'm doing  how i think money fallback to i18n it's not working and help to improve the gem  thanks  mateo

thanks for the quick response  since the operator of the admin page will be a non english speaker  it is desirable to have the menus in there language  and because the language is a 2byte character one  it is not possible to have model and action names changed to fit them 
sure totally gtalk is the same as my github  the run down is i can't reassign what the referencing table is when editing a polymorphic object  i have a polymorphic image table that allows image to be attached to a bunch of things say a "user" when i edit an image  http   localhost 3002 admin images edit 1  i can't change that relationship from "user" to say a "person" i have to remove the image and create it on a person would be nice if it allowed a drop down with a list of models that a polymorphic association can attach to 
here is the configuration city  fields  default  name  priority  active form  name  priority  active order_by   priority  name relationships  filters  name search  name application  dealzza thanks

no luck so far  it only happens on our production server which is serving about a million people on average at one time  so i can't really mess around with it too much    i cannot reproduce on my local setup  i'm going to keep poking at it though 
i reproduced in a minimal environment  while the application i'm writing should run on google appengine i moved  djangoerror_t  in a template and replaced the following lines 
ah  by accident  was looking at another issue  sorry 
perhaps post request had more amount of data     in my case it was xml text data     and size would not be more than 1 mb     but it has text line this  lt someelement gt   lt fewchildrens gt   lt  someelement gt   lt someelement gt   lt fewchildrens gt   lt  someelement gt  few some elements in text format
the key would be the url regex  value would the class to handle the request 
i'm not sure  but i will just be cautious when naming template files 
the first two errors reported are indeed generated in that way  the last one is triggered when raising an exception inside any render function when running a frontend application

that is not the issue  it is ruby 1 9 2  the ruby 1 9 1 you see in the stack trace there is a well known ruby bug that outputs the wrong version  nothing to worry about there

hey benny thanks for the clarification  makes sense  i'll swap out my fork with upstream 1 0 1 and see if i can figure out why that's going on  guessing this is due to the combination of the site i'm upgrading and its old extensions so   it's gotta be something in there  is 'name' something that gets passed in from an extension's config  i'm grasping at straws here without looking at the code directly  ha
afaict each has different behaviour and each could does appear within some common 'snippet' context making it nigh impossible to work out  just by reading the code  that what is going on with 'usage' on line x  nothing  like what is going on with 'usage' on line y 
sorry  this is with 0 13 7 
yes  you are right  i wrote them myself and made a pull request  https   github com wycats thor pull 107
i stand corrected  thank you  still  if there isn't an issue with doing a local 'tmp'  or 'tmp' plus random number to prevent collisions   it would be easier to write cross platform code  rather than having to detect the system and then use different environment variables depending on platform 
certainly 
👋 hi rafael  nice to hear from you  it really depends on what the sub commands load of course  my subcommands are provided by other gems so i don't really have influence of their loading behaviour  i do get your point tho  i can also just tell my other gem implementers to have good gem manners and use autoload 
just forget about it  thanks 
because that's what the  options  hash is constructed from  when i want to extract values from it  with  #slice   and pass it into my own libraries that provide their own default options  with  #reverse_merge     it gets corrupted

well  yesterday  i watched the two networking talks from 2010's wwdc  where they mentioned that the defaul nsurlrequest timeout is 60 seconds  i double checked  it still is   i'm guessing apple have a reason for choosing it to be this large  i think it's because on the iphone it can take a number of seconds for the link to become active again  so if you timeout too soon  just as the cell wifi becomes active  then the app will be returning an error unnecessarily and draining battery  additionally  i don't think there is anything to be lost having a longer timeout  as while the request is sat waiting   when implemented correctly  it's just waiting for an event to fire and shouldn't be blocking any threads  i appreciate the framework is for macs too  but from developing my own app  i'm finding that on the simulator  having 10 as the default is not a problem at all  but on the device  when the link is significantly more variable   it times out quite a lot  i've only recently just changed the default to 60 to see how it goes  so  not sure what it should be yet  i suspect somewhere between  60 does sound like a long time  on a related note  i've not looked through asihttprequest enough yet  but does it automatically retry requests that fail 
thanks and i don't mind at all  things are crazy during the holidays  but i will try and get a clean test after the 1st  if anyone else is caught by this and needs this fixed asap  just comment and i'll move some of my priorities around to accommodate   
oops  sorry  i missed the notification on this  i'll give your solution to clean up deprecation messages a shot  the deprecation message was a bit annoying  so i just rolled back to 0 11 4 for now 
i haven't been able to create a minimum repro    and even weirder  if i run any subset of my specs i don't see the problem  very bizarre  travis runs that show the error  https   travis ci org sodabrew puppet dashboard jobs 3602092 and the triggering code that i commented out  https   github com sodabrew puppet dashboard blob rails3 spec models report_spec rb#l400 454 note that by commenting out this block of code in one spec  i don't see failures in three other sets of specs that run later 
didn't know there was a "yuidoc" json key option  it's been pretty buggy using certain styles of the config  but i have other things that matter more  if i have time to go in and reduce the bugs i'll re open
no  it's a file  after manual clearing the target  output  directory it's working again 
hmm  okay  i wonder if this is an issue with my set up  would you mind forking the project and attempting to build the docs  if so here are the steps     fork dropkick  https   github com robdel12 dropkick     checkout the docs branch  https   github com robdel12 dropkick tree add doc generator    run  npm install    after that run  gulp docs  to build the current docs with the default theme    this is the hackyish part  go into  node modules  and find  gulp yui doc relative   then go into the  index js  and change  this line  https   github com robdel12 gulp yuidoc blob master index js#l74  to "simple" and try rebuilding the docs  for me this causes the screen shot above  if it works for you i'll be relieved  p
as far as i can see  typographer  replaces   c   with  ©  etc    there are some examples at https   markdown it github io  but neither i know the old behavior  nor if it makes sense to change it… i'm fine with both…
this is what i was looking for  thanks  this feature should be added to the   json config docs  http   yui github io yuidoc args #json   closing

i basically have items that need specific behavior  so   in a gem   i just pass them into a basic cell that delegates down to some default behavior for the specific class of the item  if the gem is included in an application the application itself can override the behavior simply by having the builders of the default behavior locating the cell based on conventions specific to the item's class  but it's just an observation of what would seem intuitive  in my case other requirements forced me to initialize the cells in the parent controller anyway and then pass them into the view instead of using render_cell  so that problem doesn't apply anymore 
here is the line where it loads that rake task https   github com apotonick cells blob master lib cells railtie rb#l35  i think that loading rake tasks should be optional  probably it would be enough to check if rspec cell gem is loaded and do no load  test cells  task 
ok  thank you

yes  original file is at https   gist github com jreidinger 59d5d2a471ff83a94cab409db2cbe184 version of augeas i am using is jreidinger linux vvcf   prace yast packager test data zypp  rpm  qa augeas augeas 1 2 0 8 2 x86_64 it is opensuse 42 2 version  i can check if there is any patch on top of it

 lutter i think this would be good for my use case  basically  the code that i've sent you should be doing direct translation from xml to json  then  we take that json and filter things that we need  if augeas would support dump json  then we could drop our xml2json code  which would be very nice

yes  you are right  i am a total vim virgin  i started using it a couple days ago with no prior experience  i spent hours looking for answers before asking for help  and the best i could muddle out was that a modeline is a commented line that occurs in the top or bottom  generally 5 lines  of a  vim file  this line provides instructions to vim on how to set tabstop  shiftwidth  softtabstop  etc  at least that was my understanding  i see the following line in the bottom of autoload rails vim " vim set sw 2 sts 2  and that appears to provide the proper 2 space indent behavior for files in a rails project  i see similar lines at the bottom of ftdetect ruby vim  indent ruby vim  etc  i assumed that one of those lines would setup the 2 space indent for ruby files that are not part of a rails project  it is highly likely that my assumption is wrong and that plain ruby files have some other default indent spacing  but i haven't found anywhere that states what that is  nor can i figure it out from looking at the scripts  i'm trying my best to rtfm and figure things out on my own  but so far  i'm just floundering in the dark  any enlightenment would be greatly appreciated 
will check  thanks 
nope  but while searching i found that i had  set regexpengine 1  and that was causing it  if that's also unsupported  feel free to close this 
ok  upgrading to the latest version of vim ruby fixed the issue  thank you for your help  and for all the  amazing gifts  https   github com fanaugen dotfiles blob master vimrc plugins#l40  you have given us 
it works  thanks

your right taf2 copy does work as shown in your test  thx so much todd 
i went straight to http ssl_verify_host_integer   2  which does work for me 
it seems to me that solves the issue  the monday i will test it harder   thanks  
yes you are right the problems with git not being in the path  so i guess something goes wrong with that installation  i actually checked before and looked for an git executable  but didnt find anything  will check with the git installation   thanks toni
thanks for the quick reply  my version of gem is 1 3 5  it's interesting to note that ubuntu disables  gem update   system  in favour of apt get  which is why i'm not yet on 1 3 6  adding   var lib gems 1 8 bin  to my path allowed me to remove my little rubygems hack from generator rb  this issue can now be closed

i am using net http to make a request to server for head only to check the last remote file update  then if the remote file update is   than local file  i send an asynchttp to request the file  i can´t request headers only with asynchttp  so that´s why i use net http for this proupouse  something like this   maybe you can add an asynchttp head   the same way you can do with get  post  download_file  etc in future versions  i saw  in another post that "blackberry use xruby compiler which is 1 8 compatible  some difference from latest ruby is possible" maybe that´s why not compiles the new net http after the migration to 1 9 2 in recent versions  i will try to replace the net http folder extension with an older version to check this

hi  ruby version 2 2 this is code
as soon as upgrading to 3 4 2  the exact same error shows up and the app starts having problem accessing the table 
maybe the problem could be solved if for every attribute all the activerecord error messages are set  but with many models and attributes this is a hell of a lot of work  instead i use generic activerecord error messages which are just fine  the classes can be found here  http   gist github com 132526 i get the following error message 
but if the form element has within it both ways value attribute defined with no data and no value attribute    sizzle don´t provide a way to get those fields together 
yes  you're right  old elements are replaced  however  new elements are not  they're simply added to the  cache  variable    regardless  cachelength   imagine adding the following keys  assuming a  cachelength  of 3  "a"   added to  keys  because  keys  length is under the  cachelength   and a's value is added to  cache   expected  "b"   added to  keys  because  keys  length is under the  cachelength   and b's value is added to  cache   expected  "c"   added to  keys  because  keys  length is equal to the  cachelength   and c's value is added to  cache   expected  "d"   added to  keys   removed from  keys  because it's over the  cachelength   but _still_ added to  cache   unexpected  shouldn't  cache  not include d   "a"   added again to  keys   removed from  keys  because  keys  length is over the  cachelength   but replaces the previous value in  cache   expected  this behavior is the same across all browsers  because i think this is an algorithm problem  the problem occurs when adding an object with the key d  does that make sense  happy to explain further  as i'm probably not doing a very good job 
receiving from a get request with the http stream callback
yes  its here  https   gist github com 1616242 cant find why it dont work properly 
sorry for the delay  i saw this commit and debugged until the clientoptions  the line that stopped doesn't have any proxy attribute  so i gave up of this branch and reverted my changes  i reverted back to 0 3 0 version  in a near future i will try again and post my results here 
i'm sorry  i was talking about httpclient's cookies attribute  but after reading the code i realized it was only used on redirections  what i'm looking for is a way to persist cookies across requests on the same connection client

 arpunk  yurrriq sound good  but as a newbie  i still don't know how to write spec and type annotation and run dialyzer on lfe file  hope someone could write a short tutorial to show people like me the way to do it

either ignoring or creating a hash element ''    true should be fine  
hi bob  thanks for the reply  i managed to replicate it outside of event machine  but not outside of fibers     my short term solution is to require "require 'addressable idna'" at the top of my script before anything else runs  although this is not ideal  because 'addressable idna' is a dependency of a dependency of a dependency

no  it's empty 
just do a select all on this issue page  it triggers it for me  i think almost any github page will trigger it  possibly because of the icon fonts  but that's just speculation  on this particular page  the error i get is   error  " xe1" on us ascii  
no  it really needs a deep merge  iirc  the spec requires array ref anywhere lists are possible  so it should be safe to add lists  possibly  dzils metadata plugin model is wrong and each should get an opportunity to modify the full hash instead of trying to naively aggregate  otherwise  list adding is going to lose sort  which sort of sucks  david on mar 17  2013 5 28 pm  "karen etheridge" notifications github com wrote

actually i heard mixed reactions to this kind of "builder" problem  but i have not investigated yet what's the root cause  if rails  if ruby  if the weather outside the window  anyway not relying on it might be a good idea at this point   
if i knew how  yes i would  i thought "issues" seemed like a reasonable place to note the issue  but i don't know the process  sorry  on 5 1 2016 10 04 am  michael grosser wrote  ## with kind regards  valerie asensio _founder   developer  wishalizer org_ bringing app iness to rescue animals 
i can't really  but i can say that i have this at the top  #  bin sh the real issue is that the project is hosted on github and when the build is run on window the script file is downloaded and eol chars are set appropriately   windows crlf     i initially thought that i could manage this by forcing the file to be dos2unix'd but it looks like we will have to resolve this by fixing our git setup 
as i understand jdeb   version   is what debian manual calls upstream_version and by default jdeb creates a package called   artifactid  _  version  _all deb  this makes the generated package a debian native package which is when "it is clear that the package would only ever be of use in debian"  i think this is not correct most of the time because i assume people creating native packages will use debian native packaging tools  debhelper  makefiles etc  while maven users will mostly package java projects falling in "could reasonably use the software on another distribution or on another operating system" which is a non native debian package  my suggestion is to change the default to non native debian version number in the control and in the generated package name with a flag in the configuration to drive native non native version numbers  something like  in the control file  version    version     debian_version   the generated package name    artifactid  _  version     debian_version  _all deb where   debian_version   is 1 by default but could be configured to a different number if necessary  again  i'm kind of new to deb packaging and i might be missing something obvious here 
 attribute_check sounds like it's definitely the issue  better readme patch submitted 
i cannot reproduce the issue  consider the issue closed  i'll re open it if i encounter it again  for clarity  are filter_resource_access and filter_access_to  all equivalent statements 
yes 
in requirements and examples "is   user  "   the same as current_user in controllers yes  in rails 3 it works  but in rails 4 it doesn't  and i think that's because  in 3 we have object collection class   array in 4 it is object collection class   activerecord  associations  collectionproxy

oracle    cold fusion    ajax    json    client    using it to basically display audit trail information  since i have control over the data all the way through  it was easy enough to change the oracle query to return a mm dd style instead  which i've already done  
i'm not using the bootstrap tool tip feature  the docs says is disabled by default unless you "opt in"   you can see in my first post the title is indeed in iso 8601 as you suggested   and the timeago was being calculated correctly  but when you mouse over  the exact date wasn't adjusted correctly to the browser timezone  which version  i don't know  i got it from nuget 
unfortunately  i do not trust the client to have the correct time 100   my thoughts were that if i could somehow use the server time  it wouldn't matter what the client time would be 
i use  tim pope's pathogen vim  http   www vim org scripts script php script_id 2332  to append _bundles_ to the current runtime path  that way you can create a   vim bundle  subdirectory and place all your vim plugins in a separate subdirectory  that keeps the _root folders_ in   vim  clean  as you only have to keep a single vim script in  autoload   it also makes updating all your plugins a lot easier   git submodule update

i'd actually prefer a programmatic interface  two reasons come to mind    1  the first is unit testing  upper level classes will set root and potentially class specific appenders  under normal operations this is all that is required  however  when i'm running unit tests the lower level classes have been instanced all by themselves and therefore root  nor class specific appenders have been configured  to keep appender set up out of all my unit tests i need the class to be able to give itself some default appenders if needed  to do this the logger appender accessor method would be needed  2  another use is in classes used across different projects  a class could then use a default appender configuration unless otherwise set up by a given project  what do you think       original message      from  twp  mailto reply reply github com  sent  monday  august 01  2011 10 49 am to  delsol  ben subject  re   logging  would like a access to a loggers appenders  #9  thanks for the clarification  normally when i use the logging framework  i set an appender on the "root" logger instance and all the loggers in the hierarchy will use that appender  when i need to see how things are configured i use the show_configuration method     https   github com twp logging blob master lib logging rb#l398 that method will dump the current list of loggers and their appenders to stdout  or any io stream you give it   this is not a programmatic interface  the output format is designed for human consumption  will that give you what you need  ## reply to this email directly or view it on github  https   github com twp logging issues 9#issuecomment 1702382

yes  the base64 encoding appears to be related    that code works in both jruby and mri  the value that is base64 encoded came from a hmac  the submitted code is a simplification of some code derived from https   github com fwenzel django sha2  thanks dave on tue  nov 5  2013 at 3 56 pm  t j  schuck notifications github comwrote

hello darkk  in the real world it is quite common that you don't want to or can't use tor   ex  when you are using proxies to manage access your own private infrastructure  but that is not the only case  i can also imagine me sitting behind a http proxy trying to access my socks server somewhere in the world  in order to do it i have to make two hops  that is why i think it would be great if redsocks allowed me to do it  proxy chaining is supported by some other proxifiers like  proxychains  proxifier  widecap in theory it should be possible to make redosocks running with proxychains but still i think it would be great to have that functionality in one box
long after the syslog file will grow indefinitely
for now i am testing a closed environment and if everything is right  i would like to release it with an app  my story  i have an api that sets proxy server on device using iptables   supports ipv4 and ipv6 proxy  i would like to start redsocks to listen for v4 v6 connections from iptables and sends them to a http proxy that knows 4v v6 connections the proxy server is built in house and we also have a domain that responds with v4 v6 ip's 
hello  thx for answering  here is my config            original body is the same than the second tcpdump i gave you in my first post  you can see user data of the empty file  with the script perl you can watch cgi request  q and how the body parsing failed because of the weird things i showed through tcpdump  well this is a supposition  regards 
i punted on it for now and am working around it in my project  i think it's worth a fork   pull request to add it into geokit rails and i may work on that still  but it would be cool to get a "yeah that's a good idea" from the geokit rails team before doing that work  without doing any work to geokit rails  i think something like this would work technically  but i think that's ugly and not sure if it has scaling or other problems

thanks for the response  1  the only fluxbox specific variable i found was   desktop_session  which is set to  fluxbox  2  thanks for the hint  i fixed that by uninstalling chrome and install chrome beta  i saw that this issue was recently fixed in chrome   now both  xdg open  and  launchy  opens the url in chrome alone 
sure  all in  this commit  https   github com mik die morsbox commit 76fccdcc442475ee2f075f703d2dbe8d6a8082ad  breaks when app i18n   yml were empty and i get pages#index

so  i was building a rails app to reproduce the problem and turns out that the problem was related to my custom  id field not accepting a null value via migration  with the  null    false in the options   so if my "save " method inside the standard "make" method from machinist gem failed the folowing "reload" method would fail as well  since active record fills such field with 0  zero  on it  when saving fails 
add this in config environments test rb  this will result in slower tests  but that's better that erroneous tests 
latest changes  2 years ago  try to download the lates release  404   has been so for months  sublime text 3 not supported  introduced 2 years ago  i know nobody who is still on version 2   no issues fixed since 2013        it's dead since the beginning of 2014     so to use it a  i would have to download it  rewrite it to support sublime text 3 and new os x versions   don't have the time right now    b  downgrade os x and my editor to at least 2 years old stuff  download and try to compile it   not really an option for me    c  decide to not use it and that i can't use the rails footnotes plugin   which is the way i have to go  and probably all os x users must go 
woops  sorry  i was supposed to get back to this  this is the entry point   i just moved to this package after noticing that this is being maintained and the old one was not  the other package was https   pypi python org pypi xmlrunner  where we pass a stream as the first argument of the runner 
sorry for the inconvenient  the problem was i  i was trying to remove version 1 5 0 with that command   sudo gem uninstall geokit  while i should use gem uninstall  geokit    install dir    gem ruby 1 8   after doing that i just installed geokit again through gem install geokit  v 1 4 1  thanks  tisho for the support 
unfortunately  yes  https   github com evanphx rubinius issues#issue 692 evan  the other evan    pointed out this is swig  i looked at their sourceforge project and it's got 173 open bugs  so getting it fixed might not be easy  i'm not sure what the best approach is  but this is really bad on swig's part 
 twobitlabs that's  2 0 4  
i fire it up via 'bundle exec autotest'  the test case i sent you should exhibit the same behavior if you add a couple of more tests  i'll leave that repo thru the rest of the week

sorry  meant to include this in the report  http   www cl cam ac uk  mgk25 ucs examples utf 8 demo txt it's just that diakonos renders the whole file well  except that the width of the thai characters  line 123 130  get in the way  the problem occurs because one character is a consonant  and the vowel gets superimposed in the same space  so the editor thinks there are more characters then are actually rendered  there must be a way to incorporate this in a future release   diakonos seems to have come such a long way since i last evaluated it a number of years ago  some editors do this correctly  notably jed  jupp  vim  nano  pico  le and joe  others have the same problem as diakonos  like dex and e3  edit  dex has now been fixed  july 2017  
yeah  later found most of the other links were down on that page  is there any place to check the example 
the issue was resolved after switching to the branch ar_42

hey greg  thanks for the swift response  i realize it's frustrating when something that should be working  and is working on your end  is mysteriously failing on some user's end  i've had some progress  but am not quite there yet  i cloned your repo  and placed rdf trine lib and rdf query lib at the front of my  perl5lib  now when i store a file into an empty database  all the tables are created as expected  and the resources  literals and statements17424528244949393372 are populated with the contents of the file  so this is different from the previous situation in that the statements table now also contains stuff  however  when i then try to run a query  the statements17424528244949393372 gets wiped empty  here's the script i'm running  perhaps i'm doing something wrong in the   opts argument   some things of note  i  i know this query should return exactly one result  and it does when i do the same with in memory storage  but here nothing is returned  ii  note the warning coming out of rdf  redland  the first log line   iii  after running this  the statements17424528244949393372 is empty again  what do you think  thanks

it does help  a lot  would you take an mr updating your readme to fold in some of this info  1  what's stopping you from just renaming the rebase command  i would  3  i hope the filter can be set to "all branches"  i'm going to need that  here's my situation  i need a a cc fast export command that will ship a fast import stream capturing an entire cc history to stdout  with branches and labels  i don't care about live syncing  your rebase command  the way it uses lsh  looks like a place to start  i don't know how interested you are in this use case  so i don't know whether i should plan to up gun your code  adding a fast export command  or write my own tool  if i were to write my own it would probably be in go   i like python but dragging in all the dependencies that implies is unappealing  relevant fact  i maintain these    http   www catb org  esr reposurgeon  http   www catb org esr cvs fast export  i may have figured out how to solve the deletions problem  my solution depends on two assumptions  a  a directory's version gets bumped when   and only when   a file is added to or deleted from it  b  it is possible to specify a directory and a revision number and get a list of the filenames it had at that revision  are these premises correct  do you have a sandbox machine you can give me ssh access to with cc on it

i was at home  from my office  it returns a resolution error  not that you make me thinking about it  at home my isp company provides an interstitial page when a domain cannot be resolved  like opendns does   this might be the cause  because this test is very environment dependent  you might want to have a look at mimic  https   github com lukeredpath mimic mimic is a very interesting tool to test webservices or send calls to external uri  i often use it when i need to create web service clients  perhaps it might be useful to you as well  feel free to close this ticket as it depends on my environment

basically html tag parsing   tag   tag  for now i'm just hoping that they match up  i could assert that they match  also  if they don't it's definitely user error  so not a critical issue  sent from outlook on wed  aug 26  2015 at 7 34 pm  0700  "orlando hill" notifications github com wrote  currently  waxeye doesn't have backreferences or capture groups  the grammar file that defines the waxeye grammar language has a way to label the result of a parsing expression  and give those results to external code  the external code would then be used to do context sensitive checks beyond what a normal parsing expression grammar can support  however  i haven't implemented those features yet  because i have never had the need  what problem are you trying to solve  — reply to this email directly or view it on github

somesimpleapp works  so i'll try to figure out  what goes wrong in my app 
the thing is  this only happens when i use passenger + apache  it works fine on console  webrick and passenger standalone  the other thing is  i have a newer version that the code i'm having problems  i deployed in the same server  and i works fine  so there is also a problem with my older code  i think  i having the sites running over passenger standalone + apache proxy pass  sucks a little but it does the job  i only maintain a single version of sphinx on my servers  let me if you find out something  on thu  jan 10  2013 at 1 53 am  pat allan notifications github com wrote  ## augusto ruibal
i was using ts v3 2  updating to 3 4 0 seems to fix the problem  thanks for the explanation 
i was looking at doing a rough port of how the ruby client works   some operations read from all hosts in the pool   collate the results  other operations work against a specific host  i also prefer simple   and am thinking of a separate class beanstalkpool or similar  but there might need to be some changes to the core code  thanks
it disappear somehow  closing for a while until i can reproduce it 
hi  rachelleahklein the project this was noticed on uses rails 4 2 6  but i have also noticed it is using new relic 6 3 0 355 the issue has been resolved in a later update of new relic  6 5 0 357  back in june  thanks for getting back to me  but no fix is required 
i just did a clone  migrated the db then tried it out out of the box  ran the cukes first and that's what i got  i checked the code and the "given i am logged in" posts to  admin session right  it posts to bypass the authorization and it passes  its just weird that the third step still brings me back to the login page instead of the home page since admin is supposedly logged in already 
here is the full class with some of the custom "app" classes removed   i also verified that facter osfamily returned "redhat" correctly  notice that i have to include tomcat  redhat instead of tomcat in order for it to work 
i believe so   
i couldn't reproduce the problem by adding a test case to router filter unit tests  it seem to appear only in combination of rails 3 2 3 and rspec  this line  get  edit  id  situation id  locale   de will properly set the locale in rails 3 2 2 but not 3 2 3  in non test mode locale params seems to be recognized properly even in rails 3 2 3 
found out that it's already handled and covered on the master branch  the solution is replacement of the dash  minus sign  with underscore in the element name  the example below is working 
i'd suggest that  callsuper  should _only_ do the "pass all args up magic" when there are no arguments  aka  callsuper      and in the case when there is one or more arguments  aka  callsuper one  two    you must explicitly include every argument you'd like to pass to the parent method  more specifically 
it's a rewrite of java swt  i have requires and uses to replace the import statements from java  requires for the classes in tht extends statement and the other imports as uses   of course i have modified for javascript  i've used my own class lib so far  which has been using 'requires' and 'uses' as names  too   but was about to rewrite it and looked for existing solutions  yours has been proven the required functionality  well except circular dependencies as i lately realized  no way to work around 
in firefox with firebug open  just press f5 repeatedly  that being said  i think i've tracked the issue down to firefox throwing an onload event before cached files are fully loaded  thus not an issue with js class  i've experienced same issues with images  you can probably close this issue 
using email  mime as follows     headers are set via parsing  not direct assignment 
huh  thanks for getting back to me  i ran this from a script that was pulled down from identical git repositories  if you want to check out how it was set up  look here  https   github com draquet polyglot blob master build_image_osx sh  starting at line 65  when i pulled from there on v 14 of osx it worked  but when i pull onto my laptop  which is old enough that it can't go past 13 6   my dmg file has no background  the extension to the app is visible  and the icon size is not set  if you would like to take a look at the dmg file itself  i can upload for you to analyze 
sure  shall i just remove the greyscale color mode or shall i check  if there is a color  then it's color  otherwise its greyscale 
i installed activesupport and reinstalled  this worked for me 
i realise that this is relatively trivial but i am trying to get into the habit of submitting issues when i see things i think could be improved in a gem  rather than just forgetting about it   
i maybe have a clue what might cause this    mpdas scrobbles the song  while keeping the now playing status as an extra item https   fb 53280 de w5zccd    i guess this might cause issues from time to time  also  the timestamp is wrong  it says 9 minutes ago  even though it scrobbled a few seconds ago 
i'm not really sure about the specification  https   standards freedesktop org basedir spec basedir spec latest html but you're right  it might be overkill for just one file  the other programs  that use subdirectories  have multiple files and it makes sense for them  changing the name to mpdasrc is enough  thanks for implementing this 
this fixed it  thanks a lot 👍 could you please tag a new release soon    
it's this line that's the problem  https   github com andk cpanpm blob master lib cpan firsttime pm#l1344 it should be giving us a list of environment variables and we're getting an empty string instead  to replicate  you need a to have no cpan configuration and have a perl for which you don't have write access  running "cpan" the autoconfig should ask if you want local  lib  if you say yes  at the end of the bootstrap is says "here's what you need to put in your bashrc " but then it shows nothing 
what about  alias_method  to_s    target    at least that will trigger recognition in the mind of the developer 
yes   drop_uid uid  3003   works in my case   setgid  to  3004  works too 
i'm happy to help though my experience with creating and  or maintaining gems is quite limited    the change breaks nothing on any platform since it is a pure ruby change  and it only does a double require with exception catching  i can think of a couple of ways to help    i can build the gem  got ragel working  and provide a  gem that people could download and install locally on ruby   2 4   i can take on the role of maintainer   but will need some help  if you don't mind  there have been no updates to the gem in 4 years  so maybe  the maintenance effort is relatively small 
 d c x   would change a time text to '14 18 48'  yet the actual current local time is '15 34   ' which matches the output of  strftime ' h  m  s'

hey nick  thanks for your reply  and thank you very much for your contributions  here's the thing  after reviewing http   www rubyinside com nethttp cheat sheet 2940 html among other examples  i always research before asking for something or reporting any issue  tried to make something like  but it raises with undefined method "use_ssl"  this is just one of the examples that i've tried  if you have any clue on how to solve this i'll appreciate  again  thanks

it's not easy to output a meaningful error message in this case   dvdopenfile  failed due to an unknown reason  in my case the reason was a missing file  but there are a number of other possibilities  and probably most of the times it has been output already  i think any generic error message would be fine  like "dvd file could not be read " so at least the user knows that there is a problem with the input data  at first i thought the program is broken and crashes unintendedly  maybe it's not the fault of dvdunauthor that  dvdopenfile  doesn't always output error messages  but in my case i wonder why the function is even called  as far as i can see its result is only used if  numcells  is greater than zero  but in my case  numcells  is zero  so i guess it should work even though  dvdopenfile  returns  null   using a dummy vob worked fine 
first  could you please explain why dvdauthor input xml file and dvdunauthor output xml file do not have the same schemas   i think i've read  maybe in the ml  that dvdunauthor was in advance compared to dvdauthor  the former being able to describe more dvd features than the latter  can you confirm   for what follows  i will suppose that you do  from what i read in the source  the xml structure is verified by a manually build tag allowedchildrentags callback associations  so i would propose 4 steps  1  confirm that the dvdauthor xsd is in sync with the output of dvdunauthor  if not  fix it so that everyone could have a common reference 2  update the tag allowedchildrentags callback associations to match the schema of dvdunauthor  using empty callbacks for missing features 3  update dvdauthor output xml file to be in sync with the fixed dvdauthor xsd 4  implement the empty callbacks introduced in 2 what do you think

at the very least  mention what you just said above  if you don't poke around at git much  you may not realize that all the 'git' command does is run 'git foo' when you type 'git foo' 
i don't think it will be a problem   rfscholte  is aware of that  https   issues apache org jira browse mshade 289 focusedcommentid 16548022 page com atlassian jira plugin system issuetabpanels comment tabpanel#comment 16548022  and he said this would only impact clients requiring the  minimizejar  feature of the plugin 
ok  so that shouldn't hold back a release then  i won't have much time to test for a while  but will file a bug if i have any further troubles  thanks 
three and i might alright 
i have already tested with my theme disabled and with nothing else enabled that i know effects the popups  i just searched the whole elgg installation for  rel popup  rel "popup" and rel 'popup'  and nothing of relevance was found   only instruction docs  core ui files and sandbox files were found 
probably i did not make myself clear  there are many sites where some users have their name in english and some in a regional language  there are hundreds of regional languages   only the site admin needs to determine which one to keep  after sorting from a to z  another sorting should start according to the unicode characters of that regional language 
 iionly  i just uploaded the contents of zip downloaded from the site   jeabakker  the elgg version is the latest available to download in the site  php is version 5 7  azure allows me to choose from 5 6 to 7 something   iionly  in this case  all i have is an ftp to upload files  i don't have any kind of server access  is a paas option  a web server as a service   i just tried to upload the files and start up the installation    azure provides us with a iis server with a local mysql integrated  and a phpmyadmin installed   as i needed this fast to show to some folks at my company  i installed it on a ubuntu virtual machine and that worked just fine  it would be nice if someone with more php experience could check how to use azure paas to deploy this  it's free for a basic web site with mysql and 10gb   there is also one click setups for a lot of good products out there  example  https   azuremarketplace microsoft com en us marketplace apps monosoftware monox tab overview 
 jdalsem  i upgraded elgg versions one at a time   elgg 1 9 then to 1 10 to 1 11  1 12  then finally 2 3    everything seemed to work normally immediately after upgrade  but a few weeks later i realized that when new members were signing up or registering to the site  the log browser utility did not show any log events for new users  a logbrowser plugin that allows the admin to browse the system event log has always been active    elgg_log1  https   user images githubusercontent com 2689041 38912541 76ab729e 429b 11e8 961f 481dea2eeccb jpg

we have a soa style system with several servers handling different aspects of the functionality  they are all akka http rest api servers  and cassandra   the web facing frontend server can expect 100s of concurrent requests from clients  and it needs to make requests to the backend servers to serve each  at the moment  we are using a "connection per request" client based on the akka connection level api  see e g  #17057   under moderate load  we are seeing an average of 50 concurrent connections to one of our services  with peaks of 100 concurrent connections  we expect to scale that up by around 10x  i was hoping to be able to drop in the connection pooling client instead  and save tcp setup costs  i think i need a max connection limit of at least 100  and ideally no limit  to avoid queueing requests at the "http client" bottleneck  i don't think that's true in all cases  if a connection represents a concurrent operation  no pipelining here  as the operations are not idempotent  then applications may choose to pay some extra cost to allow more concurrency  rather than queueing requests to meet some arbitrary connection limit  it seems fairly cheap to me  we have been making a new connection for each request for a while now awaiting the connection pooling http client  and it seems to work fine at even fairly high loads  we do see "time_wait" port exhaustion at very high throughputs with connection per request  so we'd like to be able to use connection pooling  but ideally without artificially limiting the max concurrent requests 
one of my goals as an app developer are to not get locked in to an aa provider that has 80  of the solution or hasn't been keeping up with the latest "it" methods  it's a wide world out there  so making this stuff pluggable helps a lot  i think the toolkit should provide a solid spi for authentication but not get locked in to api for specific providers  if you look at spring security  they've done a great job at providing a single api to dozens of different authentication schemes  ss is an add in to the toolkit  not a part of it  so the add in can be reved without waiting for the toolkit  from a marketing perspective  having everything external means akka is far less likely to be listed  here  https   www us cert gov ncas alerts   as a developer  my primary concerns are that i can test _for the current user_ having a permission with a very lightweight call  as an architect  i don't want developers to be able to test on a role  because inevitably the developer who created code for "administration of cat pictures" checking a role of "admin" ends up having that role used by the guy granting root access to the filesystem because "admin" meant different things to both parties  permissions solve this  if at the expense that a permission needs to be created for every little thing that a system can do and those permissions need to be rolled up into roles that are assigned to users   in the short term  developers go with text files like tomcat does and in the long term connect with something like redhat ipa   notice that i'm not talking at all about specifics of any particular aa scheme  some providers like kerberos do authentication but no authorization  pam is an example of something that can do both  but it locks deployment into linux hosts and requires extra staff specialization to maintain  there's also issues related to per service authentication  like otp  but work consistently over time  and 2fa that real world apps need to handle gracefully  witness the lastpass hack today   tl dr  i don't think it's a good idea for akka to have aaa api built in  rather a separate project that can connect to solid spis in akka and encourage competition so the best solution for specific site requirements can be chosen by those teams 
 jrudolph yes  i was initially using  routes tail foldleft routes head    _   _    when i couldn't find a   empty  for routes  i guess my idea is the   empty  is a pretty common idiom with collections  and my brain naturally searched for that when building this out  seemed like something others would might do as well 
at the time  it seemed to be shutting down the actor system before the mailboxes were processed 
perhaps a warning box at the bottom of the introduction to http   doc akka io docs akka 2 4 7 scala http routing dsl routes html#routes   done  i'll think about making some pull requests  but i need to sort out the cla first 
 ktoso   that is the version that i used and the exact plugin line i added to plugins sbt  i didn't use intellij to run it  i ran it in a clean checkout  from command line  with  gen idea  as the first command given to sbt and no  idea directory in the project  i don't think it gets much more pristine than that 
i cannot  it just doesn't work in a more complex stream  but the merge seems to be implemented correctly  there is a test suite pasted as you can see and it works for all cases 
buffer   takes n items at a time and pass this to a function n window   takes a moving window of n items and pass this to a function n
i tried to strip our playground as much as possible  https   github com sthielo ab11ij
yes   datacenterforwarderspec   however  it only did it once for each of the stack traces for me  and i can't get it to fail any more    yes  with the exact same code   
no even from command line 
adjusted cassandrapersistenceplugin to work with 2 4 0 rc1  possibly messed up something but can't see anything in stacktrace regarding plugin    mentioned faulty line also looks okay
the issue appears with baasbox  thanks for pointing to the correct rfc  i will open an issue in their tracker  will have to use a workaround for now   
i use the default strategy  so it will be restarted  even so  no messages are sent after the restart  i've spent a little more time on this  and have some updates  my producer     https proxy     destination if destination is not reachable  the proxy can't establish the 2nd leg of the connection and reset the 1st leg connection  my producer caught "stream closed" exception and restarted  after a couple more of "stream closed" exceptions  the producer is kind of stuck  no messages are sent to the wire  i have to bounce the whole application to get the flow working again   
akka   loglevel   "info" loggers    "akka event slf4j slf4jlogger"  actor   debug   receive   on lifecycle   on       no more setting on logging of the project 
 jrudolph can't tell about 2 0 m3  it's a fresh code using 2 0 1 version  regarding the closing side    i'm not sure   either chrome's websocket client or akka http itself  i'm not getting any exceptions in the log btw 
thanks for hint    johanandren   it turned out that callingthreaddispatcher was used as  stream materializer dispatcher   i guess it is not supported  i'm closing the ticket
that's weird  i already use scala 2 11 7
 hepin1989 i have already done as what you have said  but when i offline to compile  it still logged the above errors  what i compile is an akka project   i really don't know what was missing   it always want to find the following file   br    unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala library 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo scala sbt org scalasbt sbt plugin releases org scala lang scala library 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo1 maven org maven2 org scala lang scala library 2 10 2 scala library 2 10 2 pom unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala library 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml    br    unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala reflect 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo scala sbt org scalasbt sbt plugin releases org scala lang scala reflect 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo1 maven org maven2 org scala lang scala reflect 2 10 2 scala reflect 2 10 2 pom unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala reflect 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml    br    unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala swing 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com scalasbt sbt plugin releases org scala lang scala swing 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml unreacheable url http   repo1 maven org maven2 org scala lang scala swing 2 10 2 scala swing 2 10 2 pom unreacheable url http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala lang scala swing 2 10 2 ivys ivy xml  
i am using akka 2 4 8  but i don't specify the snapshot store plugin in akka conf  if the localsnapshotstore is only provided for use in tests dev scenarios  what should i use in a production application
working on a reproducer  persist is getting called in a future  could that be the issue 
yes  i'm working on it right now
yes i have  it is logging the markers but not the exception  if i use actorlogging logback is logging the exception without any problem  the problem is i think the markerloggingadapter does not using the cause parameter in the error method's body and just ignoring it   see my previous comment's first snippet  it is the source code of akka    my logsback xml pattern is like this one 
 raboof thanks for the confirmation  we'll try take another route to handle these failures for now as we too don't expect rehydration to fail ever  but seems due to side effects in the rehydration process  we do see these issues occasionally 
  log  is good enough for logging  but in my case i often have the need to report metrics between multiple stream stages and not couple metrics reporting with the logic of the flow  therefore the proposed solution is more flexible  i agree that we should not encourage side effecting  but flexibility and usability of the api is more important in my opinion  as you already should thing about thread safety on any stage performing side effects  including  map  or any other operation 
sure  i will update source of the example
i will try to come up with a pr  however  it is not clear to me why there is this require bundle header  normally the package imports should be sufficient  i guess it is there for a specific reason  as this is normally not considered best practice in osgi  could somebody give me a hint before i break something 
we are building framework where we expect different parts of code will spawn required actors  every such a piece of code will take care of actor's lifecycle  but ultimately in the end we want to shutdown everything  there we want to stop all the actors created using this actor system  with the approach you have suggested  we have to introduce  stop  message and every actor needs to handle that  we might not have control over enforcing that constraint  it is fine in this case  if we shutdown all the children as system is going down and it is ok if actor gets terminated even though it has some messages left in its inbox 
i take your point  patriknw  but arguably  option  does too  and that's there  would you suggest using  status success   status failure  instead 
 patriknw here's a pr  https   github com akka akka pull 24994
will do  
 johanandren my use case is to use akka persistence as a simple event journal which i can use with persistence query  so the actors have no state  they are just a mechanism to write incoming events to a journal  guess you could argue it's a use case that akka persistence was not really meant for 
i opened a pr for this  i would add a test if i could think of a good way to test it  it is tricky because the message for the entity needs to be processed before startentity  it is relatively easy to test with a full scale system which is how i found this issue 
 johanandren thank you for your reply  the unwanted log is created in  def init submat  materializer   at the line i mentioned  since in my case the  loggingadapter  is a  akka actor repointableactorref  i would have to turn this off  but i don't want that 
 johanandren i'll try to create a reproducer this weekend  i suspect it might be triggered by 2  servicekey s with the same name  but different classes  at least last time this issue was resolved after duplicate  servicekey  names fix  though it might be a coincidence 
we have built stuff around auto down to prevent split brain  so yes we are aware of the risks     unfortunately no it never happened before  and i can't reproduce it  i am trying to activate  verbose gossip logging  on new nodes  as we can't change this for nodes already running   hoping that will help 
i don't know this code  perhaps it should be   
the websocket that i'm talking about is in scala  https   stackoverflow com questions 57375015 i was trying to insert websocket apis in a project that uses rest apis using s   u can find the extension of the problem in the above link
akka 2 6 4 i was using alpakka sqs sink that was a restartable  upon restart  it keeps on using cached dns i e  "unknown host"  i would imagine the dns resolver should not be caching exceptions no specific dns resolver configs  just out of the box alpakka sqs with akka typed actors
for more context see https   github com gradle gradle pull 1844  do you have a better idea on how to approach this problem 
i don't have a stacktrace  and won't be able to get one   the issue was not about the artifacts not being present  but about not being able to connect to the repo due to a missing custom certificate used for connection 
excellent point  ldaley  we should have a broader discussion about this as it's not the first time this is raised  let's discuss the implication in the this issue  https   github com gradle gradle issues 4019
just a though  not arguing against  if we consider every other properties  we allow them to have no value to force people to set a least a default value  with that regards  it does make sense to start out with no value 
 bmuschko i think the different options above provide enough flexibility to solve this in other ways that don't make a huge change in how the  jar  task currently works  closing 
with java 9  i do not get the warning anymore  but the link is rendered as unlinked text  i did not try the ant based workaround yet 
yep  that's the actual message  i think the stacktrace must have been filtered by you guys  i set an exception breakpoint and saw it was coming from underlying zip code  let me see if i can reproduce again and give you the exact location  that's definitely the right gradle version 
 lacasseio thanks for your response  i have just tested again  can not reproduce too  i'm sorry to trouble you 
 bmuschko as you see  dist task https   github com apache groovy blob master gradle assemble gradle#l644  does not depend on the  clean  task  p s  even if i search all gradle script files  only one  clean  task found  https   github com apache groovy blob master subprojects performance build gradle#l45
this is with 3 4 0 at the moment
 big guy  i'm not using gradlew in this example at all to cut out extra steps in order to isolate the issue  as stated in the defect description i'm running my gradle script using specific gradle binaries  when i'm actually running it using gradlew i'm using the version coming with the appropriate distribution without any changes to it  i use following command to switch project to a specific gradle version    that's how i first encountered the issue  
 bmuschko there is no stack trace  this is the full console log of the example project  using cmd exe and  bat  scripts  
 bmuschko unfortunately my knowledge of gradle is not sufficient for this task  also link to the design document is broken 
i am just trying to scan my code with findbugs  but getting a warning that it cannot find some of the classes  the classes that it cannot find are not in the default output directory  but in one added via  sourcesets main output dir output  builtby  'taskname'  
yes  i am willing to contribute  but i do not know  where to find the location of the error  i have scanned the source code for the pattern  but i could not find it  this is  why i was forced to create an issue instead of a pull request  can you give me a hint 
assume i develop a build that uses a grade plugin  now i need to modify the plugin to extend it  i want to test it in my consuming build  so i deploy the plugin to maven local  in the consuming building it would now be nice to be able to use mavenlocal    the same for the others  if someone decides to deploy his plugin to maven central or jcenter but not to plugin central  they would be easily usable  i was not aware plugin central mirrors those  if this persists  maybe only mavenlocal makes sense 
maybe also  jnizet can say something  his pr added the feature as it is now and  eskatos reviewed and merged it 
https   github com gradle gradle pull 846
hi  wolfs  yes  the steps are correct and i have reproduced it multiple times  forgot to mention i use gradle wrapper  assume it does not change much though    gradleissue  https   user images githubusercontent com 8123842 51548620 feb1ad80 1e68 11e9 849d 31800d548adb gif 
 lacasseio  sure  here's a  build scan  https   scans gradle com s qmaz5kwi3atsu   i ran the tests on a different os than last time and now only the 8 3 name test fails  i will look into making the other fail as well  to reproduce the error i issued this from a command prompt   
yes  that's right  jenkins job parameter is   ghprbpulltitle renaming xyz     'xyz'   i tried a bunch of possibilities and found the following work as charm   this  ' dghprbpulltitle "renaming xyz    '"'xyz'"'"'  doesn't work  i think the system is trying to redirect smthn to a file  also it is described in the  java docs  http   docs oracle com javase 8 docs technotes tools windows java html   sets a system property value  the property variable is a string with no spaces that represents the name of the property  the value variable is a string that represents the value of the property  if value is a string with spaces  then enclose it in quotation marks  for example  dfoo "foo bar"   and escape special characters or quotations to adhere to the shell syntax  in the  shell command language  http   pubs opengroup org onlinepubs 7908799 xcu chap2 html  definition it is stated that  so yeah  i agree it is a gradle plugin issue 
 bmuschko i just reviewed  glefloch implementation  looks good 
i think i got gradle with androidstudio 2 3  2017 03 27   but when i typed   gradle tasks   in bash  it said gradle wasn't installed  after doing   apt cache search gradle    i discovered  gradle gradle doc libgradle core java libgradle plugins java and then ran  sudo apt get install gradle gradle doc libgradle core java libgradle plugins java   gradle  v                                                              gradle 1 4                                                              gradle build time  monday  september 9  2013 8 44 25 pm utc groovy  1 8 6 ant  apache ant tm  version 1 9 3 compiled on april 8 2014 ivy  non official version jvm  1 7 0_121  oracle corporation 24 121 b00  os  linux 3 19 0 32 generic amd64 linuxmint 17 3   64 bit   4gb ram when installing androidstudio 2 3 from the official website  it suggested these packages that were already installed  libc6 i386 libncurses5 i386 libstdc++6 i386 lib32z1 libbz2 1 0 i386
   pitest features+ your_added_feature   i don't know if the   option  mechanism support that  update     pitest features  instead of  pitest   features  as i hope to have that syntax supported one day  without the need po put it right after the task  
 marcphilipp i made an interesting observation  your initial assessment was right for commit  51d2b76b  https   github com asarkar java tree 51d2b76bf798612d6a2acd358a535928dfbc8bcd jpms learning   it was my bad to have removed the    add exports  jvm argument from the  build gradle   afterting  adding it back  https   github com asarkar java blob master jpms learning build gradle#l50   the test indeed gets ignored if   disabled  is applied at the method level    as long as   the test class is  public   if the visibility is changed to package default  the annotation no longer works and the test is executed  afaik  test classes don't need to be  public  with junit5  right  if that's the case  then this ticket stands as a bug 
yes  this also works  i didn't know how to interpret the syntax of the method  kotlin is still quite new to me   
i used idea 2017 1 3  does it even depend on idea version  considering that project is generated by gradle plugin and everything was fine with gradle 3 2 1
 w25r yes  i can do that 
 lacasseio sorry  i'm reboot computer this bug disappear
i found another way to solve the original use case    by using a  property  instead of a just a  file   gradle will understand the task dependency  and there is no need to implement the interface  publishartifact  
  https   gradle org install  manual install section   https   gradle org releases 
 ghale good point  i just checked and this only happens on  jdk 9 0 4   not 8 
i upgrade my gradle version  and add  apply plugin  'idea'  to root build gradle 。 it works
thanks for following up on this  there is no cycle in ant targets  otherwise ant itself wouldn't be able to load the project  i think the bug was introduced in 869916c5dc081a75af10548e76e2d1ccbc7687a9  where the test for empty cycles collection was dropped in  defaulttaskexecutionplan onorderingcycle     before  as there is no cycle  the call to  graphwalker findcycles   get 0   fails  i believe by inserting this guard the bug can be fixed  i can provide the pull request if you like  cheers 
 testsuites  is part of the  junit test suite  dsl  model   components   main jvmlibraryspec    testsuites   test junittestsuitespec    junitversion 4 12 testing   components main       i tried to make a minimum example  but i can't reproduce the error  however  updating to gradle 4 1 my main project no longer fails finding the integration test classes  so i guess the issue was fixed somewhere  reverting back to 4 0 1 the tests fail once again 
sure  i will create a pull request  btw  i think only version    4 0 are affected   in 3 5  it was still correct as  was used 
on ci  i use gradlebuild to create a very simple task that runs collection of tasks after doing some little configuration  this also allowed us to put plugins behind a flag during development  applying those plugins would break android plugin's task configuration avoidance setup and cause thousands of tasks to be configured   not only i put only a single task to run at ci  but also i can put this special task as a shared run configuration into the ide  that means by default all static analysis tools  jacoco setup we have all gets configured and run when this special task runs  i achieve many things with only couple of lines and o love it 😊 composite builds replaces this task but then i would need to create a real project 
what's the problem to create it yourself  i provided a full  build gradle   the only thing you need is to create  x zip  that contains a file  possible empty  with   js  extension  then run  gradle unpackarchive  t   weren't you able to reproduce the same issue 
yes  that approach looks good  thank you for working on this 
weird  maybe it's a machine specific problem  just checking out https   github com vanniktech gradle maven publish plugin tree 5 1 failing and executing    gradlew signarchives  at the root level yields the failure 
sorry  it only happened in my production code in jenkins with jdk8u66 not test other version yet   i can't reproduce in my local or simpler example project     check source of  traversegraph  method didn't found code modify  dependencies  list during iteration  and there isn't concurrent code too  
yes 
i restarted my computer and now it works     i should have tried to  turn it off and on again    i think i might had some deamon that were in a bad state  anyway i'll close this for now 
alright looks like i was being dumb  my assumption was that codenarc was code inspection for java   obviously it isn't  should the codenarc plugin perhaps warn in some way if the groovy plugin isn't applied or are there reasons for not doing that 
 blindpirate yesterday  its only show a message 'throw a java awt headlessexception' without other information  like this   error  65  1  failed to create component for 'dialog' reason  java awt headlessexception java awt headlessexception   but today after reopen and rebuild my project  the task can work no error with gradle version 3 3  i dont know why  but it is strange  
 big guy hi，"substitution" means replace project depend with module depend  such as  replace b with  com example b 1 0 0 
yeah i verified i thought there will be timeout so i have waited for 10 minutes but still it is in idle condition
 bmuschko  sorry for long reply  weekend after all 😄    here is sample project where this bug reproduces   click  https   github com saksmt gradle publish issue 3003 
as of now  scripts that do the equivalent of  readlink  f  to resolve actual path fail miserably  i'd expect the file type to be replicated properly  if something is a symlink it should be reproduced as is  imho 
i'm using gradle 4 1   sorry  should have mentioned that  
i see that this task has some inputs  so i thought missing the output  and some other inputs  was accidental  https   github com gradle gradle blob master subprojects plugins src main java org gradle api tasks upload java#l141 if this was by design  then we might need to accept it  it would just be a bit nicer if this was fixed  we added the output to the upload task a few years ago to make it up to date when nothing changes  but over the years we have occasionally run into build failures where we would need to clean the entire output  a pretty large directory  to get past them  i'd like to get away from this practice and have traced the issue to this one  there may be others that i'm not aware of   if this bug is fixed  we won't have to trade correctness for performance  and instead can have both 
i was hoping that the above quick fix would work but i'm running into yet another issue  gradle sees an added empty directory  without any source files  and assumes that the directory is a resource and then disables incremental compile with this message  "full recompilation is required because a resource changed "  i'm working on a reproducible project  but it's not too easy     i will see if we can work around that issue too  otherwise we'll need to wait for 5 1 1  when do you think 5 1 1 will be available 
when reporting the feature  i wasn't really concerned as much about where the default value was  but rather being able to configure it through the public api  if necessary  in my case  the tests run through pretty quickly  so even 1 minute in my use case would be too long  looking through the codebase  i think that it wouldn't be too hard to allow the idle timeout to be passed through from the gradlerunner api 
i think the use cases are quite close together  both want to lock down a version   gradle witness just locks it down a bit more than the current implementation of dependency locking in gradle 4 8  for me it would make life easier as currently updating the dependency block in the gradle file is a bit painful and it also clutters the gradle file a lot see  https   github com walleth walleth blob c41141a3c69472f2c8419fc9fbf21b8e0e1bbe3c app build gradle#l233 also when things change in gradle then the plugin has to be adjusted   had a long time where gradle witness was not working at all when using with new as gradle   in trezor android there is still a problem in one module   context  https   github com trezor trezor android pull 34 another thing which is a bit annoying with the plugin solution currently is that having to add a jar to every repo is not optimal   would be really nice if this would be part of gradle   also knows some devs don't want to use this from a plugin but expect it from the build system   e g  schildbach
nope  i just downgraded it to gradle 3 5  did you try it in the 4 1 sha   2b019262630e5b26c6958860fb0d15a542ddd517 
thanks for the reply  wolfs   this bug is not reproducible if build cache is not enabled  try the above example without   build cache   i don't see previous build files  i haven't worked much with sbt  but since sbt doesn't have build cache bug may not be reproducible in sbt  i'll give it a try though 
macos high sierra  10 13 2  17c88  on my mac  as well as on teamcity build agents in docker  linux  i've run both with   parallel and not  maxparallelforks   1   it does not affect the result  however  if i add   configure on demand option  the problem disappears

thank you very much for the fast response and yes  of course  i will try to create one pr  after work      oh  sorry  i meaned a prefilled task  like  because it told me  that the main class couldn't be found

in the build gradle we use this notation    configurations provided   resolutionstrategy cachechangingmodulesfor 0  'seconds'     only with this notation buildship refreshes the snapshot dependencies every time  if this notation is missed  but still included in the plugin  then buildship does not refresh the snapshot dependencies "every" time  only after the standard timeout which is far too long for us  
the issue is caused by a map entry  "ext" to "jar"  being included in a  map string  string   passed as a dependency notation  see the  build gradle kts  in the attached zip   build gradle kts zip  https   github com gradle gradle files 2126945 build gradle kts zip  that map entry shouldn't have been there in the first place  removing it fixed the issue for me  i don't know if including an ext of  "jar"  is supposed to result in  guava  having no transitive dependencies  or if they should still have been fetched  since the default extension is  jar   maybe  "ext" to "jar"  should be treated the same as it not having been specified  then again  maybe there should be a difference between the two  i don't know enough about dependency notations to answer that  if this is actually a bug    this might be a problem for just  "ext" to "jar"   or it might be a problem for any  "ext"  value   the title of this issue probably should change to something like one of the following     "ext" to "jar"  in dependency notation map blocks transitive dependency resolution    "ext"  key in dependency notation map blocks transitive dependency resolution ps  i'd appreciate any insight you might have about my two questions at the end of my original post  if you don't have any info about them  then i'll just ask on stackoverflow 
i want clean to properly clean  remove any trace of the build having run  including caches  since there seems to be a missing feature  why   for forcing dropping the cache to be dropped  i decided to implement that myself and ran into the above  running the clean separately indeed works  in any case  an npe is always a bug in my book so  it might be worth fixing that just on principle 
 big guy the idea here is that if gradle determined the console should be  plain   either because the user explicitly requested it  or because it was  auto  and gradle determined that plain was necessary appropriate   but then the tool is specifically told to use it's equivalent of "rich" content  then yes    gradle output will be plain  but the tool will output ansi sequences  etc  this could undesirably put ansi escape codes into log files  etc  but that's essentially what we are doing to handle it right now    invoke the tool explicitly to use rich output by default  and provide a _separate_ toggle  project property  etc   to change how the tool  or any other such tool  is invoked  obviously  having a toggle for gradle itself and a toggle for sub tools is undesirable  it would be preferable to just make the invocation of the tools "match" gradle  but to enable that  we need to be able to determine the style of the gradle output programmatically 
it may help some cases  but unfortunately if our system gray flags a site because of a hack  or ddos  or their coffee is at 154 degrees instead of 157  its gray flagged for hours days weeks  retrys won't help  it has to fall thru to the next repo in the chain to try from a different site  thats why we always have 3 or 4 redundant remote repos setup for each repo site we pull from  im limited on how i can fix it with artifactory  and changing the order of the repos in my init gradle is out of the question because i would need a fte who's whole job is updating and redistributing the file that holds that info  day in and day out  is there a way where i can inject my own error handler into that method  nothing about my network and associated security systems is typical so i imagine the number of people with this problem is limited  but if i had a way to inject my own error handler via my corp jvm plugin we use across the board  that would solve my problem

 wolfs i see now what happened  i've read that paragraph several times  and when i re read it the last time  i just quickly scanned  and my eyes glommed onto the first use of the term  autocrlf   which uses  true   in other words  my mistake  i just re read the git docs on this several times and i still don't quite understand how all this works  git docs being what they are  turns out that  eol  is overridden if you also use  autocrlf   so that's just noise  so  the issue is behind the keyboard  as it so often is  there's a related issue  though  setting  core autocrlf false  doesn't appear to stop me from committing new files with crlf line endings  i can then clone that repo on win and nix and in each case  the crlf file remains crlf  should i just close this issue 
let me re phrase it  i would like to be able to create gradle plugin that can process swift source code using and output source code  the use case's code generation  java library to swift would be great but i would prefer a dsl to process swift source code 
 oehme now it is another lock error  1 instead of 3  
this is for a no op build that does nothing  to emphasize the gradle overhead  the extra time is pretty annoying when you are doing several small ui changes  incremental changes are  3 seconds  but that had more to do with the kotlin compiler  again  this is a very small project  look at then actual time that the tasks are running  the majority of the time no tasks are running  the actual tasks are taking up less than 20  of the build  prior to moving files to kotlin i was getting  300 millis no op builds  surely it's not expected that gradle has a 600+ millis overhead to invoke a running daemon on a project with 4 gradle modules 
i did not write it in the beginning  i guess it generates rmi stubs from classes in the main sourceset  here is a snippet from the original build gradle   i have now come up with a workaround consisting of a separate processrmijava task that just is included in the jar explicitly but what would be a proper way of achieving this 
well  the extension is likewise undocumented in that article  there are usage examples but nothing that covers all of the extension properties  sounds like both should be explained  i can try to throw something together pending your judgment of what should be added  on thu  dec 6  2018 at 03 14 marc philipp  notifications github com  wrote 
that was it  thanks  the linked samples really help  one other question i had after reading the  java platform  doc was the interplay between the  java library  configurations and the normal  java   other than  great stuff 
when i downgrade to gradle 4 x  and leave the kotlin version the same  everything works fine  which leads me to believe it's a problem with gradle 5 
 wolfs  i have an internal deployment system which expects a certain format and naming of artifacts that it accepts  these artifacts are derived from the "regular" artifacts  e g  jar files  with some additional configuration pulled from the project file tree  this deployment system expects one "main" artifact  and a set of "auxiliary" artifacts corresponding to various deployment scenarios  additionally  the "main" artifact and one of the "auxiliary" artifacts could be combined  without using the deployment system  in a certain way to get another artifact  which the user can deploy manually  if it is needed  therefore  i have a task which generates a "main" artifact and a set of "auxiliary" artifacts  where each auxiliary artifact is keyed by some identifier  which is supposed to be known to the user and make sense to them   the natural way to represent these auxiliary artifacts is a  map string  file    and there are no other things related to these auxiliary artifacts except the files themselves  the set of identifiers  i e  keys in the map  is not known statically and depends on the contents of the project that the plugin is applied to  i don't want the user to describe these keys in the build script either  this task is supposed to be called by things like cicd  and it always generates all of the artifacts  then  there is another task which is supposed to be invoked by the user with a command line argument  this second task accepts one of the aforementioned identifiers and this  map string  file   as an input property  then takes the "main" artifact generated by the first task and one of the "auxiliary" artifacts  corresponding to the provided identifier   and then repackages them to produce another artifact  which the user would want to work with directly  this second task is supposed to be run by the user  and it should not generate all of the artifacts corresponding to all of the identifiers  only the one which the user has specified  finally  in both of these tasks these identifiers are used not just for file naming  but they actually are used to perform the packaging of the artifacts  so logically they should be explicit and separate from file names  also  in the future we might need to have another task which would work on a subset of identifiers and perform additional processing of one or more auxiliary artifacts  i don't have exact details right now  but still having the artifacts accessible by their ids via a  map  would be a natural approach here

in my case it's a common use case for  taskgraph before aftertask   not if you are developing an independent plugin  but if you are hooking into somebody else's work  i've encountered the need a couple of times  instead of describing a use case  i'll link you to it as soon as i commit  but in a couple of days  i'm at the beach now 
 big guy thanks for the clarification  may i suggest the description for the option is wrong then   gradle   help  is pretty clear about this  i filed the separate issue  #8833
 ljacomet increased readme in project to describe error messa
mainly because build cache does not support incremental tasks  any change in inputs leads to a cache miss and full re execution of a task  in particular  incremental java compilation does not work with build cache  plus  there are tasks which have up to date checks but are not marked as cacheable 
yes  correct  seems this exclude rule   exclude "    "   is conflicting with  include "   node_modules    package json"  the java code is the plugin i wrote to select the files the result is seen from running  gradle  i  and it shows
i primarily use force when trying to apply constraints when i want that constraint to apply not only to declared dependencies  but transitive ones as well  the use case for this i run into the vast majority of the time is forcing use of a slightly newer version  usually a micro version  of a library in order to consume fixes for security vulnerabilities  until such time as the direct dependencies update the versions they depend on   any mechanism that allows me to declare "i want any uses of this artifact  direct or transitive  to be constrained to this specific version" would be sufficient for my purposes
 big guy the build completes with no further output 
i've been going back to older versions of gradle but still cannot get it working  earliest i have tried is 4 5 1 
wow  yes  thanks  the updated documentation is really helpful   that cross project publication turned out to be so horribly complicated is unfortunate but can not be blamed on the documentation  
i agree with you that exposing  getclassdisplayname  is problematic  since  defaulttestclassdescriptor  already returns the  classdisplayname  as  displayname  i'm not even sure we really need it exposed  the only use case would be if i have a descriptor that represents a method  i could ask for the display name of the containing class  but this could also be done by using  testdescriptor getparent     wdyt  marcphilipp
there appears to be no    gradle init d directory also  the build won't get to a point where it creates a build scan link  here's the steps i tried  1  removed gradle build scan quickstart and    gradle
we designed a gradle plugin which handle the process from snapshot to release of our products  we add all needed repositories and publications and change currently the group of 'unsupported' tasks  sure i can test for ci specific env variables which can also be set locally on the development notebook  but i would recommend the way to create combinations  if i can add multiple repositories then why add complexity with conditions

 behlendorf unfortunately i do not have the message before that in the kernel panic  i only bothered to copy out that particular part  i would look to see what it is  but i don't know why i was getting that panic in the first place  so i can't reproduce it  i want to say that i changed my kernel configuration  but it was something completely unrelated to zfs  something about networking or something  i have made a habit when recompiling a kernel to comple spl  zfs kmod and zfs along with it to avoid issues  i'm not sure if that's too much tough 
"in a vm" you mean totally virtual  or a virtualized system accessing my physical drives 
the server is my router firewall  i can't test right now  i will do that later and report here  i'm running zfs on one more server that is not a router firewall  and that one doesn't crash  apparently i'm using slab  not slub  i don't know why though     i can try with slub to see if it makes any difference  yes some times  but not always  the kernel  i guess  gentoo 
i tried git head source but corruption occurred  also zfs 0 7 1 with patched source using only https   github com zfsonlinux zfs commit f763c3d1df569a8d6b60bcb5e95cf07aa7a189e6 but again corruption occurred  with set  zil_slog_bulk 1073741824  and multihost on unfortunately the same  environment description  two physical or virtual machines with shared 2 disks  zpool is created using shared disks  zpool uses only one mirror vdevs and with two zvols  one has volblocksize 8k  second has volblocksize 128k   cluster is set up using corosync and pacemaker  client machine connects to storage using iscsi  scst 3 0 is used to configure one iscsi target with two lun's  each lun is created using underlying zvol created on zpool  zpool and all zvols has set property sync to value always  client machine is windows os that runs bst5 test on connected iscsi storage  scst is configured to use block io  write through is enabled for each lun  test description  test uses bst5 to write data to iscsi connected storage from windows os  during write i force power off node which currently has pool imported  second node takeover the cluster resource by importing pool and configuring scst to share zvol as iscsi luns  bst5 is able to continue write to lun's without braking the test  when sequential write finishes i wait until bst5 tool read data with compare  now bst5 reports data on mismatch error when it read data with compare on lun which has zvol with volblocksize 128k  for lun which has zvol with volblocksize 8k corruption is not reported  i also eliminate cluster enviroment with single node which is force rebooted and automatically import the pool and configuring scst to share zvol as iscsi luns but again corruption occurred  is it safe to revert https   github com zfsonlinux zfs commit 1b7c1e5ce90ae27d9bb1f6f3616bf079c168005c and using it with zol 0 7 1 
no  it's the same size 
 behlendorf i was testing zfs on iscsi disk based on zfs with different parameters  see #4211  i wanted to check if performance changes when using 4 kb blocksize for the iscsi disk  as the harddisks on the storage server are 4kb advance format  the standard linux iscsi target  lio  seems to have issues with setting the logical blocksize higher than 512 when the reported blocksize of the used disk  zvol in my case  is 512 
after any reboot does not work 
by  a  i mean that right now check  that will ensure that there is no children on the target fs  will run only after actual receive is done  and it's quite irritating to see error message about unexpected clone fs after receiveing 1tb stream    so  maybe it's better to set some kind of lock on the target fs so it will not possible to make clone of snapshot if parent fs is under receive 
scrubbing the pool panic'd the kernel in an  at least superficially  identical way  zpool status never complained  but it may not have gotten a chance to  i have had to nuke the pool to get our machines back into production  but i can try to reproduce it on a different set of hardware if that'd be desirable 
you're right  it looks like a zfs sharenfs bug  i just verified that it works fine if set sharenfs off and just put the filesystem in  etc exports 
well maybe  but the fact is while device haven't been detected yet by kernel  init script tries and fails to import rpool  and only  sleep  helped  why is that  it is on usb  yes  it looks _very_ similar to my case  maybe it's even exactly what i have  and we did the same dirty hack to fix this  because i missed your zfs_initrd_post_modprobe_sleep     it's simple  find rpool name in  zdb  output  unfortunately  it depends on  zpool cache    find its devices and wait  with a 10s timeout  for example  for them to appear in the system  or even simpler  just what  rjvb proposed  because there isn't much of a choices here    cheap usb sticks suck  from https   github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs issues 108 i still think it's because of a timing  zfs init scripts runs and fails before stick is found  i can't explain it in any other way  and _sometimes_ it is imported before init scripts  then all the three attempts fail   a pool with that name is already created imported    that's why i added this additional "just in case" condition to check if it's already imported and proceed normally 
 tuxoko there is nothing in dmesg  system hangs just like someone cut off the clock source from cpu  i have never seen similar effect before  unless this was a h w failure   i suspected the hypervisor but i reproduced this also on vmware and physical single core machine  i can only get core dumps from kvm and it ends with rip in different places mostly in kobject_get function   behlendorf i'll try today with different kernels and if it solves the issue i'll track down the commit that solves it  i already tested version with commits mentioned by you  they didn't help in this case

yes  i do  i really want to understand what's going on here  on a traditional fs  "i o error" would  assuming the transport was ok  mean that the disk i o failed  and there would be a message from the kernel in syslog complaining about the block it was trying to read  but i don't see anything in syslog when i get the i o error from zfs 
i have a couple of sources for this    testing clamav's onaccess scanning support with zfs  i have a centos 7 system set up  the kernel supports fanotify  and i can successfully detect the eicar test virus on an ext4 filesystem by doing a "cat eicar com" and get an error in the clamd log file indicating that a virus was located  on zfs on exactly the same host  i get the following error during clamd startup  error  scanonaccess  could not watch path ' fstest'  success and  if i try to access a file on one of the zfs file systems  i get no warnings in the log files  i've tried with a variety of atime relatime options to see if that impacts the detection  and it does not    sophos has a support page that lists the status of their on access a v with various linux filesystems  it has two columns for each filesystem   one for talpa support  which i believe is their own module they inject into the kernel to do on access detection  and one for fanotify support  fanotify is listed as a "yes" for several filesystems  including btrfs  ext2 3 4  jfs  xfs  fuse  but listed as a no for  among other things  zfs  this page does not specify what variant of zfs they're talking about  so it could be they're referring to an implementation of zfs other than zfsonlinux  but i believe most of the other ones are fuse based  so presumably they would fall into the fuse category  instead 
i've been having this problem for a while  it's not just been on the 3 17 kernel  dedup is turned on as well  so i enabled   enable debug and it's now crashing trying to bring the mirror back to a consistent state    i think it finally crashed at the right point that one of the mirror devices got corrupted   i zero'd out the first and last 100mb of the drive and did a "replace" on the pool with the same device  after running the drive through some diagnostics   the resilver just completed and i am now back to rsync'ing to see if the debug build provides any additional information if it crashes 
crux 3 2 rolling build all previous  from git  builds without problems
i installed after that commit  which is why i was surprised  however  i spent the weekend trying to cause it to freeze up again  and failed  after the last time i recompiled zfs and reinstalled it  so maybe i made a mistake the previous time  anyway  i'm keeping an eye on it and if i don't have an issue again by the end of the week  i'm going to close this ticket 
  ls  l  dev disk by id   zpool import  d  dev data   zpool ls  l  dev disk by partlabel total 0   zpool import  d  dev disk by partlabel data  imports properly    ls  l  dev disk by partuuid   zpool import  d  dev disk by partuuid data  imports properly  exporting and re importing does not appear to provide any permanent change the  dev name on the existing pool  bkid from linux  diskutil from osx  for some reason  in linux  the zpool is associating with "ata corsair_force_gt_135004090ff015790001" which symlinks to  dev sda in  dev disk by id and is also listed before ata corsair_force_gt_135004090ff015790001 part6  which is probably why it stopped at  dev sda  i don't understand why on linux it is trying to associate with the disk instead of the partition  because of this i have to explicitly choose something like "zpool import  d  dev disk by label" instead of it mounting automatically  as far as why creating the " dev disk0s6     dev sda6" worked  it would have appeared alphabetically before  dev sda so the fact that it worked at all was by pure chance 
i'm pretty sure this came out of the recent changes in either zvol semantics   ryao's elimination of an io layer  or the accounting code  dont have a specific commit as i only noticed it this morning on the 3rd stack containing zvol accounting fixup 
need to look into ami  but we will probably want to automate custom kernel builds since distro kernels use rap which makes out of tree modules a nightmare  i could theoretically fork our local aur kernel package to drop all changes past grsec and set it up to track upstream linux grsec simply using our k config to build without rap and hidesym  on rolling releases like arch gentoo  keeping that image updated may require some tlc and automation too  but quite doable at regular intervals  or even in callback form on kernel package build success           original message          from  brian behlendorf  notifications github com  sent  thursday  december 1  2016 01 28 pm to  zfsonlinux zfs  zfs noreply github com  subject  re   zfsonlinux zfs  add grsec pax image to buildbot  #5436  cc  rageltman  rageltman sempervictus com  author  author noreply github com 
i would actually look to something like the  arch  https   git archlinux org svntogit community git tree trunk pkgbuild h packages linux grsec  linux or alpine packaging scripts for this since they are just shell scripts which acquire and patch source trees  i think a pre build step issuing the configure and copy builtin commands should handle getting the version of zfs to be tested into the kernel tree  the shell scripts  pkgbuild in the case of arch  can pin versions or pull from git repos pre populated with versioned and patched source trees allowing us to target specific versions with specific pkgbuilds     url  question is  how do we handle installation of the new kernel with the modules  reboot into it  and ztest subsequent to the reboot acros platforms 
the overflow detection is being done by pax  https   forums grsecurity net viewtopic php f 7 t 3043   integral component of the grsecurity patch set  this functionality is being upstreamed adapted to mainline now that grsec has closed its sources to the public   will happen on every kernel soon  indicates we have a dangerous math problem   
thanks for looking into this sir   pretty sure that used to work
thanks  dajhorn for pointing that out  i'm releaved that there're no severe kernel errors  i was not able to read the stack and make the connection to https   github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs issues 124  could you precise your statement on whether using a network filesystem is unsupported or suffers from "deficiency in the ubuntu init stack"  like you stated in #124  i e  a dependency on an external issue  which might be fixed at some point   please  thanks in advance for that   
i ran across this here     "https   github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 2373" my issue was not exact  but i had been experiencing the same symptoms  extremely slow copies between client and file server nfs mounts  and even slower copy rates between zpool exported mounts  lame question  but is there any information on how to build your own package you can point me to  i've set some zfs parameters  which seem to be working so far  but i wanted to attempt correcting the nfs issue permanently with the 0 6 4 release  if possible 
yes  it is new  i just checked my logs  from serial port  and since nov 2015 this was first time zfs import by cache took more than 2 minutes  there were few occasions when it took over 1 minute  in over a year  machine is restarted daily   the l2arc is hosted on dc p3700 nvme  same as slog  
 kingneutron i totally agree with you about the raspi 3b being under powered for zfs and i am not using it for any production usage but just for experimenting and testing  i don't care about the low bandwidth of usb 2 0  for my tests i am actually quite happy with the throughput i got  around 33 mb s read and 25 mb s write  i am actually having fun by creating a glusterfs cluster on top of zfs with 3 raspberry pis and i must say it works much better than i expected it to  i just thought i would report this in case it could be of any use for you guys and i assume here that it really has to do with the fact that the whole system is not powerful enough for zfs  last info yes i am running 64bit  here is the output of a  uname  a 
 tuxoko actually it is talking about this issue  "  your backend filesystem appears to not support attrs large enough to handle the configured max rados name size   " this is documented here  http   docs ceph com docs jewel rados configuration filesystem recommendations #not recommended actually this could be also read as xattr naming is too long  i'm actually unsure  but running ceph in the latest version on zfs is currently a bit tricky and not fully supported  as this document states  "this may result in difficult to diagnose errors if you try to use rgw or other librados clients that do not properly handle or politely surface any resulting enametoolong errors " actually i didn't want to go back to filesystems like xfs because of this issue   
https   github com zfsonlinux zfs pull 3938 i thought it was being worked on  guess it died in the meantime 
 krichter722  yes 
i've never used the nfs feature and the sharenfs attribute has the default value  off   the nfsd daemon package is in fact not installed on the computer 
hi  rlaager  yes  indeed  the ovmf package provided by ubuntu 16 04 contains the appropriate split  all of the three mentioned steps are required  for info  i was previously under ubuntu 14 04 and after upgrading to 16 04  i was able to persist the boot manager configuration  hope that's help  eric

 ironmann thanks so much for the weights  i'll revise my commit and make a pull request shortly  yes  ssse3 is only used for the byteswap variant  as it requires pshufb   i could also create two fletcher_ops_t structs  one for sse2 and one for ssse3    they would share all member functions other than the byteswap routine 
yes you are right  when i tried both  finally i leave zfs fuse  i do not remember why now  probably because a problem i was having with dkms and the kernel in that time  but right now i am not sure  the important thing is that yes the problem was with zfs fuse  i reinstalled debian zfs package  i did the same test and i didn't have any problem with it  no  i am not using any snapshots in right now  sorry for the confusion 
it is quite strange  like you said 4 2tb in z2  up until this point i have had no issues with it    this pool has been running for almost a year 
yes  i've set it to  auto   yes  it still does  it seems to work  but note that  bike zroot  is the source and  tank zroot  is the destination  i'm also sending snapshots  so this command fails   not always  but my kernel was updated on july 7th and i rebooted on july 12th  which happens to be the date of the problematic snapshot 
 bunder2015 unfortunately i don't have a reproducer on my side  the issue was hit few times on a different site   so i can't verify that with 0 8   but looking at the patches i don't think they are relevant 
i do have another zpool called 'storage' which is a mirrored vdev  but i'm not using that zpool to create this zfs volume  regarding dbgmsg  that file is empty 
sadly that's impossible  it's nvme drives  no cables to exchange  or controllers     there's a total of 4 drives  but it happens on all 4 of them  i moved the mirror between them to test if any of the drives has an issue  it's an amd epyc system 
i've also tested this on upcoming ubuntu 18 04 lts  which has 0 7 5    https   packages ubuntu com bionic zfs dkms    and it shows the same behavior 
i should have updated the case  after updating the packages to  7 all is good now  thanks for the reply  chris on fri  aug 31  2018 at 3 15 pm brian behlendorf  notifications github com  wrote 
grub cmdline is empty  but as i understand it  the options you tell about are kernel and init options  and i experiense a long black screen before grub loads  right after bios starting bootcode  if i enable debug all in grub cfg   i see very much lines of zfs  read gpt header  verify  free malloc  free malloc  then again read gpt header  soon i'll make a log of this output 
sorry  haven't noticed this came out  trying  thanks  i will report back with the findings  btw  according to the outputs  arc oversizing doesn't seem to be the problem here  no 
i tried to replace the faulty disk with this command   zpool replace tank ata wdc_wd40efrx 68wt0n0_wd wcc4e2nn9jnj ata wdc_wd40efrx 68n32n0_wd wcc7k5vh43cd  for some reason  i don't have the output anymore  that failed  i think it was a not found error or similar  when googling for "zfs replace disk" i land ofc on the oracle docs  https   docs oracle com cd e19253 01 819 5461 gazgd index html  there the device name was entered directly  since that didn't work  i thought "ah  maybe the pool needs to know import the disk before replacing" and there you have it

i apologize for any miscommunication  zfs is added via plugin to unraid here  https   forums unraid net topic 41333 zfs plugin for unraid  do findcomment comment 842464 the owner posted that he compiled what i mentioned earlier 
my apologies  it looks like the fiddle i linked to did not save correctly  so it was not displaying the behavior that i explained  here is an updated fiddle  http   jsfiddle net vhrjat4j 1  i will also update in my original post  unselectauto is set to false  but does not help  it does help when clicking outside of the of the calendar  but not when clicking on days 
wow  nice support there brother  i think purge could be a jquery function  i'm using it within fc to remove events from the calendar without refreshing  if it's not an fc function then that would explain why it's not doing what i need  should i be using eventdestroy   function instead 
sorry i don't really know all these advance dev stuff  i just old code php  you can see what i mean at https   gridplay net calendar at the bottom of the calendar the iframe tag should be in colour using highlight js but calendar is somehow preventing highlight to work

it's so simple  issue is when you supply  classname  prop to  fullcalendar   it doesn't apply  if i want to show a code sandbox  i'll just take base fullcalendar code sandbox and add  classname 'my class name'  to it which doesn't make sense   this is not a mentionable issue though but it might be better if you pass  classname  prop to the outer most component inside  fulcalendar

mybuffer x      a is near useless in javascript  read  bitwise not not   but the idea is to make it an alias for  a    a   like ++a is postfix increment  a   a + 1   not    a   which is like javascript + +a   although you could use   a for converting to int32  a  0 does the same thing iirc
the issue is gone now  sorry about this 
sorry  looked around quickly  too quicky i guess    
i can  i'm saying that the file enumeration order has changed  yes  for example  the following used to process files beginning with _ first  like _page coffee then pagewelcome coffee   but now processes it the other way around  not sure if this could be environment variables in my system that may have changed  or if it's part of coffeescript source 
like i said  i don't have a specific use case  so these are mostly forced strawman   the general idea is th forms the thread  each top level statement gets inserted at the   in the next item in the chain  having thought through it a bit more  it's actually more useful in a lisp because it allows you to have the same sort of feel that you get with the javascript fluent apis  i'm not positive it'll be useful in js since deeply nested function calls are less convenient and most of the more popular libraries are designed around it 
that is nice too  it is not exactly what i had in mind  because it does not operate in a single assignment expression and because it would be difficult to work into the formal parameters

i need to call the method of the object returned by super  i expected that coffee will compiles to  pre   code  var a  var __extends   function child  parent    var ctor   function      ctor prototype   parent prototype  child prototype   new ctor    child prototype constructor   child  if  typeof parent extended     "function"  parent extended child   child __super__   parent prototype     a   function     return b apply this  arguments      __extends a  b   a prototype pull   function     return a __super__ pull call this  addcallback function result      some deferred operations with result             code    pre  but it compiles to  pre   code  var a  var __extends   function child  parent    var ctor   function      ctor prototype   parent prototype  child prototype   new ctor    child prototype constructor   child  if  typeof parent extended     "function"  parent extended child   child __super__   parent prototype     a   function     return b apply this  arguments      __extends a  b   a prototype pull   function     return a __super__ pull call this   addcallback function result      some deferred operations with result             code    pre 
i mean something similar to a  simple modules  http   wiki ecmascript org doku php id strawman simple_modules  proposal for es harmony  most of the frameworks today workaround lack of modules in js by implement some kind of the module loader systems  yui has one  dojo has one etc   commonjs modules are getting widely adopted this days  but while they work nicely on server  for browser either you have to wrap them in a functions or preprocess source  coffeescript on the other hand could've got syntax sugared modules modules much earlier before we'll get them in js
you're right  they are only referenced within the closure  however  if i create a class called  somenamespace collection   it will also be defined as  collection  within the closure  if a user of the framework then creates a class called  anothernamespace collection   inclusion order will determine which class will claim the  collection  reference in the top level closure  it's definitely not a major problem  i'm using namespaced types right now with no issues   but i can see the potential for problems in certain edge cases  after tinkering with the cs source a bit more it does look like the second solution  in the comment after the op  is the most correct one 
trevor  i'm currently using coffee 0 9 5  or commit 67c20c07  which behaves the same  under node js 0 2 4  the runtime error i get is  what does yours compile to  if the javascript looks the same  i'm surprised you don't see an error 
exactly  bracketless unambiguity in conjunction with the  not  keyword if a and not b and c compiles to if a     b    c while if a but not b and c would compile to if  a     b     c similarly if a and not b and c and not d compiles to if a     b    c     d while if a but not b and c but not d would compile to if  a     b      c     d  figured if it was obvious without an explanation  thats a +1 for the proposal
well  that's strange      edit   just read your edit  i guess it is because i'm running the latest stable release  installed via npm  i'll try reinstalling it from the repo 
i'd find it useful in cases where compiled js is to be shared with  and read by  a group rather than coffeescript source 
it's related to this issue  https   github com joyent node issues 3584 let's wait for node 0 9 
i agree with 'if' example  there is no way to know it the fn '3' is an argument of fn '2' or in if clausule  but my question was if there is possibility of omitting the comma when the compiler already knows that we are defining arguments as in example   here  if i omitt the comma the whole expression won't be ambiguous for the compiler because i knows that we are already defining arguments for fn '1'  currently ommiting comma results into adding fn '3' as an argument for fn '1' instead of fn '2'
i imagine it would be something like this   currently  i'm using it to correlate line numbers in the javascript with the coffeescript source  i know there's an open issue to support that  so hopefully this'll only be temporary  but for now  it's working pretty well  except with  else 's  i realize this won't have any sort of priority for you all  but i'm working on a fix  so i figured it was worth reporting 
1  less code 2  slighly more memorable  regex methods are just slightly different enough between languages – test  match  scan  match_all  – so that i find i often need to check the syntax in whatever language i am currently using  3  more ruby like  which i  naïvely  assume is a big inspiration for coffeescript 4  if implemented in a bi directional manner  it saves me from needing to recall whether it’s  regex match str  or  str match regex   note that in ruby  you can do both   o     'foo'  and  'foo'     o    i have to imagine this could be implemented with a very small helper function in the compiled javascript — much like how using the      operator introduces the  __bind  method  so  x    y  might compile to   of course  the big difference between this and the ruby      is that my  __match  would return matched fragments  or  null    instead of a numeric position  while all numbers including  0  are truthy in ruby  that is not true in javascript  though i understand all non empty strings in js are truthy  thus the truthiness of      would be  i think  the same across languages  for more explicit truth values  we could consider defining       at the same time   x     y  would be considered the same as  coffescript    x    y     that is  essentially compiling to  __match x  y      null  
i'm not experiencing a problem per se  but why wouldn't it check for an undefined type    'body'  attr 'randomattr'  always produces 'undefined'  and it is also the case in many situations  the point is to clarify the existance or not  and not use the standard all inclusive    'body'  attr 'myattr' 
never mind this seems to be intended behavior   didn't test it with multiple values  i'm an idiot 
why does js2coffee give me this  what am i missing  it's generated when i put the exact same code in js2coffe
 petercm thanks for your links  it's exactly what i meant  keep separate specific js seems to be a good idea  if a lot of person have this problem  maybe it will worth to take a look at it

i binary searched my code and reduced it down to the crux of the problem   that causes the exception in the compiler when   map is specified 
my usecase is developing websites with express and not precompiling coffee to javascript  iced coffeescript delivers the compiled version in it's extra directory  however it requires coffee script js to also be included on the page  what's the reason for the deemed inappropriateness 
 lydell but why not fix it in the lexer  i mean the gist of this issue is  "is this a bug or not " i think it is  and if it is  shouldn't it be fixed upstream so that developers working with it downstream are not affected  i appreciate that nice pr you put up  as it allows me to get rid of this clutchski coffeelint 5d818a5a4b4310cc147614e54d972b23f47cad88 but now i will have to contend with string tokens being shorter than they are  maybe trivial to fix in coffeelint   anyways i thought i would get your attention since you are the one most familiar with that code and it would probably be much easier for you to change than it would be for me  but assuming the owners contribs consider it a bug and would accept a pr for it  i wouldn't mind making the pr if you're too busy 
no  it is even worse with babel  without  super    it refuses to compile and with  super    it throws   uncaught typeerror  failed to construct 'htmlelement'  please use the 'new' operator  this dom object constructor cannot be called as a function   i think i will stick with the polyfill+cs for now

not seeing any reason to limit it to units that are multiples of the number  that's a use case  but it's not the only one  it shouldn't be hardcoded as the use case for units   epidemian   i understand that you'd like the operators to work  but the fact that they were born broken is no reason to limit other areas of the language  you wouldn't normally be using the builtin operators for higher level operations anyway  if you're doing arithmetic  you can still use the operators with either approach 
i've never built a gem before  how would i go about doing it by hand like you do   sorry for the noob question  if there is some documentation i can read  that would cover it  
i use closure compiler because it's the only one that produces script that reliably runs in bookmarklet's  if any of those three levels don't work  including white space only  then i try to find a compilation that works through compressorrater which has been really destructive towards any script with html strings in it  i'm open to any suggestions for a better compiler if there's one that coffeescript works well with 
i think that the only solution is to declare a variable with this special property  to be traced  perhaps the traced variable can be registered internally by the compiler and associate its corresponding callbacks in case of being geted or setted  the compiler adds after each access to a variable a call to the associated callback  probably the callbacks requires a reference to that variable to be passed as a parameter  this also means that the traced variable needs to be associated to an object   because local vars can't be passed by reference  for example the traced variable could be a property of an object dedicated to store traced variables  this new feature could also be used to emulate the observer pattern 
 vendethiel sorry            is not easy to type and i think use      to be short for prototype is a waste 
yeah  i'm saying that's quite confusing as a user  it's not wrong  but very confusing and an easy mistake to make without any obvious error showing up  you're declaring something as bound but a mistake elsewhere makes it unbound  putting the methods on the prototype when they are always overridden in properly constructed instances doesn't make much sense  if the methods were kept in the constructor's scope  improperly constructed objects would be missing the methods entirely rather than missing one subtle aspect of them  thanks for your feedback on this 
just started with styled components   first place i've ever seen this syntax  aside from the above link it is really hard to find any documentation of it

it's smaller and more idiomatic js wise 
our internal code is mostly coffeescript  and we've encountered this problem at least two places there  here's an external example https   github com algesten ductile blob master src ductile coffee#l31
 geoffreybooth thanks for looking into it right away  it might also be an issue with something on the node js side  i'll talk to the build working group to see if it is infrastructure related 
tried that  and it looks   much   better  both missing comments show up in the ast  but i can't find them in the compiled js source  yet   no  sry tried it dry on the shell and none of the two comments appear in the generated js  but as said they are in the ast  which is enough for me  smth  about comments  esp  inside object declarations seems to be very hard to tackle  fyi  js2coffee  does not support it either  and no yaml lib that i tried offers more than limited guarantees when it comes to comment handling   
it allows you to launch the redis server as a service  using the systemd init daemon  instead of redis creating the socket  it gets the file descriptor for the socket from systemd when it starts the service  the socket is created and managed separately by systemd  so if redis server crashes or you stop restart the service  the socket queues the messages  you can configure systemd to automatically restart the service if it crashes  and it will receive the same socket and pick up where it left off  you could even use this to upgrade redis with no interruption in service  the service can also be controlled monitored using cgroups 
yes  the second run was ok 
sure  it's similar  but it is slow than zdiffstore  zdiffstore  1 command zunionstore   zinterstore  3 command  zunionstore、zinterstore、store back to some key  i use zrange   zrem to solve this problem  but it is very slow

i'll try to play as soon as possible to try to reproduce the bug but i'm not sure i can  there is 2 type of things inside this redis instance  lists and sorted sets  each sorted set contains around 2500 strings of +   35 bytes  to build the sorted sets i'm using a big variadic zadd  zadd  key   2500 values   scores    the same to delete keys from the sorted set  except with zrem  the score is usually the same as the position of the entry in the sorted set  score range  0   2500   it's never a big number    sizeof char    i build the lists the following way  lpush list temp entrya lpush list temp entryb lpush list temp entryc lpush list temp entryd lpush list temp entrye rename list temp list  then later     lpush list temp entrya lpush list temp entryb lpush list temp entryc lpush list temp entryd lpush list temp entrye rename list temp list

 charsyam  znmeb thank you  just write cflags   march i686 on src makefile head 
after deleting local dump and re slaving it worked  so  i guess  it's the corruption  what should i do now with this ticket  i can't reliably reproduce the problem 
i am using 2 6 13  i am just referring to the "cmd documentation"     in the cli  the 'help' for "set" shows only the old api     the redis website shows the new api  but with wrong order of parameters    the actual comment in the source code details the right api parameters and in the right order
doing it in the client is error prone and very unefficient as the subscribers number grows and there are many topic overlaps  on the contrary  it can be implemented very easily inside redis  finally  handling unsubscribes in the clients means recalculating the overlaps 
 badboy  thanks for your reply  yeah  the script is fine when executing manually   var redis notify sh  echo    returns test 0 so does it works fine when you use sentinel script 
charsyam  thanks and let me looking into it  antirez  thanks for letting me know 
redis server process running  but data is lost and can not perform any command because of memory overflow  helps only service redis restart
makes sense  could still use an update for clarity 
the system has 5gb of ram  how can i check how much memory the keys are taking  i'm not sure how to do that in redis  a hundred million keys stored as a txt file in the file system is about 3gb  but then you have to add on the integer i'm storing in redis as the value for the key which is another 4 bytes per record      _edit  _ redis is reporting 2998023696 bytes in use when it starts getting signalled  presumably by oom killer 
 badboy thanks for your reply  my scenario looks like  and i need update the "old value" to "new value" however hset executed  still "old value" thanks

scan is a cursor based iterator  so  every call of the command  the server returns an updated cursor that the user needs to use as the cursor argument in the next call  instead scanstore scanall can be made to return the complete result of the iteration like the result of the keys command but without blocking the server   reducing the multiple server client round trips and reducing the redis client side complexity  so the user does not want to iterate it with the updated cursor everytime 
 antirez tried  make distclean  before to compile it is ok  there is the    deps hiredis libhiredis a i fix some code in deps hiredis  in the dir of deps hiredis  make and in the dir of root  it will produce the problem  because the    deps hiredis libhiredis a is not produced  the above can tip you

i thought that the command would be idempotent in a way that running it would throw an error only if the master ip was different or the quorum was changed  but running exactly the same command multiple times would be fine  however  this is more complicated that i initially thought and it would probably be best to leave it as is  thank you for a detailed explanation

 badboy that sounds better to me than the options i proposed  when i was looking for a way to do this  i recall being surprised that raw still printed elapsed time when blocking  better not to pollute with more arguments too  along with that  would it be good to always print elasped time unless    raw  is specified  i think having a more consistent output would be desirable

even though i adjust maxmerory to a lower it would give no guarantee  by the way  i was not looking at used_memory value and cannot proof fragmentation version  do you have any kind of algorithm to increase eviction rate if memory keeps growing up  if not  you can consider implementing it 
 yossigo good to know you think it is a great idea  the attributes of subject dn that are used for mutual authentication vary wildly  to keep things flexible in redis  we should accept any combination of at least uid  ou and cn  examples   # allow certificate with matching value for attribute uid in the dn for user alice allow distinguished name alice uid u1  # allow certificate with matching value for attribute cn in the dn for user bob allow distinguished name bob cn c2  # allow certificate with matching value for all of attributes uid  cn and ou in the dn for user joe allow distinguished name joe uid u3 cn c3 ou o3 you probably meant similar thing when you said "applying a pattern on the certificate subject dn "
thanks  i just want to know whether this would be a problem  seems not 
 gkorland   well the use case is that we want to get notifications  if status of a data structure in redis changes in our case if something has been pushed to a sorted set   so we thought we can use key space notifications for this purpose  but key space notification internally use pub sub channels of redis which are fire and forget  so in case our client disconnects we will lose some notifications  also we want to use something like a consumer group where only one of the client gets an event if we have multiple instances for scalability purposes  so we thought it would be nice if key space notifications pushed the events to a redis stream instead of a pub sub channel  as we want the channel to be reliable and scalable  and that is why i was wondering if this is possible to do in redis  and  itamarhaber said it is not possible to do it without building a module for it  so we are now exploring blocked pop to solve our use case  but i think it would be a nice add on to redis functionality 
i'm sorry i didn't reply in time  ###### this is python code    from gevent import monkey monkey patch_all   import numpy as np import gevent import time from redis import strictredis cli   strictredis   class redis_test    def __init__ self   self name   'buf' cli ltrim self name  1  0  gevent joinall   gevent spawn self upload_data   gevent spawn self func1     timeout 30  def upload_data self   # file size 64m with open filename  'rb' as f  data   f read   while true  while cli llen self name   pass cli lpush self name  data  def func1 self   while true  buf_data   cli lrange self name   1   1  while not buf_data  buf_data   cli lrange self name   1   1  cli ltrim self name  1  0    after i adjusted the redis configuration  'maxmemory 200mb'    'maxmemory 400mb' that hardly ever happens  i don't know why   
my setup is based on the following link   https   rancher com blog 2019 deploying redis cluster   url  in that link it doesn't talk about any sentinel node  i thought sentinel and cluster were 2 different things  in my example  i just create 6 nodes with cluster enabled  then using cli tool i create the cluster  even in redis cluster 101 document  i haven't seen any mention of sentinel being required 
 laixintao thanks for your reply  i think i've found the answer  this article inspired me https   redis io commands select the reason is that i rename command 'select'
1 yes  i delete testkeydb2 and then run procedure 2 the list value is 2000 to 1 and last is 1000
 antirez  itamarhaber hey  i realize the issue at hand  mostly  redis labs site quality and modules license clarity  isn't really your direct responsibility but i figure you're like the captain of the redis community and you get a paycheck from redis labs  so if their site has serious issues like it does right now  then it reflects poorly on you  even if you're not directly responsible for the price numbers on the site  given redis is one of the coolest projects ever made and i really want to use it as my main db  i was sad that some random web dev isn’t meeting your great standard here redis labs advertises they're better than elasticache because they have modules https   redislabs com redis enterprise cloud compare us  here they say the price to get those modules is  0 758 per hour https   redislabs com redis enterprise cloud   img width "891" alt "screen shot 2020 02 06 at 6 55 08 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 24532336 73988976 4be8ac00 4912 11ea 8555 1f9d442fa079 png"  then here the price nearly triples to  1 98 per hour https   redislabs com redis enterprise cloud pricing   img width "920" alt "screen shot 2020 02 06 at 6 54 40 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 24532336 73988962 40958080 4912 11ea 8a07 04fd6b734dd3 png"  this   typo hides a 261 213720317  price hike for basic features   why not take a few hours to go over that website carefully and make sure it meets your standards  this would pay dividends in the long run  cuz you put buttloads of work into redis and redis labs could certainly emulate your high quality work
i change the configuration because you said in documetaion that  i want my database and replica be exist just in memory  because of high i o  and i dont want to use aof or another durability solutions  and data transfer just from master's ram to slave's ram in the form of partially sync not from disk to disk  how can i do this   i'm using sentinel and redis version 5 0 8 
my patch for now is hard wiring the code to load "settings"  and a roadmap to switch to ubuntu    i don't really know how to best approach this  of the top of my head    when importing django_settings_module fails  simply try a hardcoded "import settings"  as manage py would do  this is not full proof either though  because a user might have modified manage py to import a different module     pass along the actual path to the settings module via an environment option  e g  the parent process would need to set os environ 'temp_celery_settings_path'   and the child process could pick it up and could import the file through path hackery  add containing directory to path  import the module  remove containing directory again     i'm not familiar with multiprocess   can one pass arguments to the child process via command line  it'd be a windows only thing  so i guess not 
we have experiencing the problem in https   github com dot2code varnish bans manager  latest release forces using celery 3 0 12 to avoid the problem with 3 0 13   anyway  we'll try to build a minimal django example project showing the issue 
sure  ionut turturica jonozzz at yahoo com this might be only a small step towards a better logging system  in the future i'd like to see a flexible way to configure logging levels  handlers  streams  rotation  etc 
sorry  my bad  to be honest i didn't expect such a fast patch  i was pipelining with the anticipation that varying timeouts for some of my web crawling were going to present an issue when mixed with timeouts for  say  my sentry logging integration  i'll try to make time for it real soon now  honest 
that's all well and good  i guess  but it doesn't solve my basic problem  is there any useful information i could offer to make this a solvable problem 
so  the quickest way to see what i mean is to look at _get_config in app base py   round line 242 we're building the configurationview   someone more familiar with the django settings stuff might have a better idea though 
i run this code in  5 minutes  memory starts growing  to  1gb  and doesn't stop 
looks good  except that the script exits without printing "ok" on stop  it seems the second call of the following line terminates the script   i'm not sure how to fix it  
disabling new relic seems to fix the issue  i guess we should bring them into the discussion    
doh  sorry   the get_many method  i edited the issue title to reflect 
i'm using celery 3 0 9  no django  settings are all defaults  i'm going to be working some more with this so i'll post any further information that turns up  thanks 
latest from pip

raise improperlyconfigured "the secret_key setting must not be empty "  is an error i have observed from in inadequate setup to satisfy django  manage py from django is used to run tests and configures any and all to do with what's required for django  using django conf  it's a partner to django admin py  which is used to generate a manage py file and others to run tests  the settings py file generally requires editing to make it address the target package  however if this means nothing to you  what i'm left with is a testsuite that cries failed  failures 1  errors 61  skipped 15   south is a package in gentoo that has a full setup   "  python " is merely a var set in an external eclass to the python impl being run  py2 7 py3 3 py3 4 or pypy even
i don't see it is even being created 
sorry  forgot to include that i'm using celery_result_backend   "amqp" i can see the task being executed in the worker log  that's why i said that everything is working fine apart from the retrieval of the result  which can work if sent through pika though   thanks 
sorry for missing your comment  will try to reproduce it in simple script
i ended up removing the custom  vhost  setting   myvhost  in the above example   so  i didn't actually fix the issue     i just found a workaround 
i'll test it with only mingle this nigth  i didn't understand why there are so many messages  so i have no ideas about right handler 
thanks for your reply  i did pull request below  https   github com celery celery pull 1155
ok sorry for the delay i was overloaded with my production system… thanks for the quick fix  i will try to re switch to eventlet in the coming week 
this was the result i got for  print "result   r"    result       i am interested in contributing a fix if someone can help me understand the issue 
 ask i should give your more details  python  2 7 3 celery  3 0 21 server  ubuntu 12 04 lts we have more than 10 servers and each is running around 20 celery workers  we didn't directly start our celery work from celeryd  instead  our worker class wraps the celery worker object  see below 
no  but we have celery deployed on 10 16 instances at the moment and it will happen to 1 or 2 of them every 24h  i am trying to identify which task might be related  i am not sure how to debug it  but if you have anything  let me know  logging is on warning right now and it is all we see 
yes  i've made upgrade  seems like all this troubles goes away    thank you 
in examples 2 and 3 that could be the case  but not in the first one  where it definitely looks like python trying to decode msgpack directly    the problem is also that the stack trace doesn't look very helpful  it doesn't actually show where the exception is coming from   
it's happening with prefork   that i see it with gevent too is something that i indeed don't care too much about 
that's a good question indeed  one option would be to return an empty string or none as result status  the other would be to raise a more descriptive exception  i don't have a good argument as to which one of these is better 
i believe the problem is that each task assigned to a worker creates some amqp scaffolding to talk to the broker because there is no unique channel per worker assigned  there is a non zero chance the broker will get a collision  as a result  i have found no meaningful way to run a lot of short running tasks in production using more than one worker

my last test attempt using master ran the  cc_produce_n  tasks and then stopped  i had to ctrl c the celery worker process several times to kill it 
the workershutdown exception is thrown in the middle of processing a task  and is not handled  in those cases  it always comes from  file "celery apps worker py"  line 293  in _handle_request raise exc   so it seems like active_thread_count    in apps worker py  is returning a number   2  although is pretty clear that there are many active tasks being processed when this happens  
yea pretty much   django contrib admin apps simpleadminconfig  this is a class that's built into django 1 7 and is intended to be added to  installed_apps  just like that
using  django  broker rabbitmq in project settings backend is amqp  but for other apps in same project settings weren't defined  app   celery 'restp'  backend 'amqp'  broker 'amqp   '  app autodiscover_tasks lambda  settings installed_apps  when i start a task  task is executing successfully the result is being thrown back to rabbitmq and each time it is is generating a new queue with celery task_id as name of the queue  but when i query for result i am getting backend disabled for other applications installed_apps  other than main app here restp
i meant that the  apply_async  function seems to be blocked  it just reaches the  apply_async  line and stays there forever  even  ctrl + c  doesn't end the worker 
i closed it because i couldn't find a simple way to reproduce it and switching to redis fixed it  so it's too much trouble to keep this open 
it is mongodb and i am using rabbitmq as broker 
 thedrow   no worries  we initially saw this with eventlet pooling but  if i remember correctly  i saw it with other  non prefork pooling strategies as well  sorry for not remembering here  it's been a busy month  smile   gtowne and i were talking about getting you a minimal repro yesterday as we are hitting this again  we will try to get you something soon will a minimal repro instead of a test case be ok 
yes sure    note also the worker name   worker 913451 as you can see the master process try to recreate the worker process forever but without success    the session identifier on oracle side remain the same   process id  11865 session id  684 serial number  7122 any help is apreciated bye
 thedrow still it is not responding  
guys  thanks a lot for reacting  my apologies for not coming back immediately  here is my reaction  the only way to reproduce the issue is     wait until it crashes  it is completely unpredictable and we have no test case to demonstrate this  sysdig  valgrid and pympler are not present on our system and we are not allowed to install them  therefore it is so difficult to to trace this issue  we did not try geventlet because our app is used in production and crashes there  we cant reproduce those crashes on our test system  but we also can't generate a comparable to production load with identical content of tasks   running without multi workers was not tried  see args  above   current status    we disabled the process  within some tasks  which generated png files  memory leak has gone  however we still can not conclude that celery won't no longer crash  it is being monitored  we suspect the certain celery process running also out of file descriptors  we started to measure it  but currently we only have data with png generation disabled and it looks like after all tasks are executed  the number of used file descriptors per pid returns to its original  idle  state  we plan to enable png generation back and continue with measuring file descriptors  to be updated 
our provider had a couple of hardware issues with their routers recently causing dropped packets  there had also been a few instances of their routers resetting after scheduled maintenance  i have not been able to test if manually disabling the interface over which rabbitmq connections is made will also have the same effect  i will try to find an isolated node in our cluster and test this 
i have to provide celery through our application installer so  i need binary distributions
as  www proj is the django project's top level directory  it shouldn't change when celery is running  it only contains the project's python and django packages  modules  and configuration files  any files that the project creates or writes to would either be photos uploaded by my users and stored in the  var www media directory or log files and all of those are located in  var log 
i get this message when i run de server   i get the same connection error but trying to connect to redis 
maybe you are right  but i got the same error   2016 01 21 23 54 08 717  error mainprocess  consumer  cannot connect to amqp   guest    127 0 0 1 5672     errno 61  connection refused  trying again in 2 00 seconds     when i had  broker 'amqp   '  on  tasks py  which made me wondering that was not using the value i was declaring  for my  experience when i declare  localhost  the tool lib framework use it like that instead of resolving to the ip address   and after looking some questions about similar problems on stack overflow  without proper answer  i decided to bring the question here  ps  i suspected but was not sure about it   password concealment  you certain of it  ps2  i will debug my connection to rabbtimq instance if its proven that was that i will remove this issue  thanks for the help   +1 
thank you for that fast reply  we configured  celery_default_queue   'low'  and added some non periodic tasks to  celery_routes  where we configured queue names only so we don't add any  routing_key  or  exchange  like it mention in  docs here  http   docs celeryproject org en latest userguide routing html   i'm found today that  celery  processes stopping in server update script by sending  sigkill  instead of  sigterm   could it be a reason of this problem 
i updated to the latest master  and the problem is fixed  all of pickle  json  simplejson and msgpack work flawlessly  thanks 
the pipe is shorthand for chain in celery  see http   docs celeryproject org en latest userguide canvas html   the result of the add task is passed as the first argument to the mul task 
perhaps  i check my installation and it has billiard version 3 5 0 0 then i try to fix that by running   pip install "billiard  3 3 0 23  3 41 0 0"   upgrade  but it have no effect  billiard version has not changed   pip  v  next  i try this   pip uninstall billiard    pip install "billiard  3 3 0 23  3 41 0 0"  but pip installs billiard  3 5 0 0 again  only command   pip install "billiard  3 3 0 23  3 41   3 5"  get right version  3 3 0 23  of billiard package  might requirements for billiard not correct  by subject "error on stopping pool"  now i testing this with correct version billiard and report here later 
 ask  sorry  i forgot to mention it  it's 4 0 0rc3 from pypi  i tried git version with the same result 
last versions
 ask did it send tasks correctly in  asia shanghai  timezone  8 hours delta from  utc  timezone 
4 0 0rc6  0today8 
not really  in my case particularly  a poor man's solution can be used as a workaround  the long running tasks are revoked manually by the user  i could poll and wait  synchronously  until the celery task stops  and then immediately start another celery task that would do the stuff that the 'revoke' handler is supposed to do  but this is really something i'd like to avoid  
hi   georgepsarakis    task name  at the specific line looks good  it is  my_app tasks fetchprofilephoto   but it fails if i run call  fetchprofilephoto   delay profile_photo_id 123   from my django console  complete traceback 
i cannot reproduce this bug with redis  i believe it is specific for the un evented brokers  i e  brokers whose  connection is_evented  is  false   both rabbitmq and redis have  supports_ev   true  in their  kombu transport    modules  amazon sqs  however  has its  supports_ev  equal to  false   so maybe it's prone to this bug  i haven't tested it yet though  i'll try to provide a script in the next few days  i haven't seen any announcement that mongodb is not a supported broker anymore  could you please point me on the docs  does it mean that any mongodb related bugs will not be fixed and eventually any mongodb related code  when used as a broker  will be gone 
thanks  aydin for looking into it  over  here  https   groups google com forum  nomobile true# topic rabbitmq users 6_9eabr57gg  i have attached the logs while in debug mode  unfortunately  nothing useful appears there  the more i was reading about celery's rabbitmq client  the more concerned i became and i switched to using redis as a broker  and everything works now  but i would like help and see what is going wrong  could you please advise on the next steps  
i tried again with the code the problem still occurred
there are no problem in my usage  there is problem in different behavior in  link  and  link_error  usage  when i calling them on group instance it just assigns them on first task in the group  when i passing them as kwargs to  apply_async  it rises an exception  i think it should be unified 
according to  broadcasting with redis broker #2638  https   github com celery celery issues 2638   i think celery don't support broadcast with redis broker for now  so i use rabbitmq and it works 
thanks for answering  i think i was mislead by the fact that it happens to work when only one task is polled  thanks to the  requeue   my patch "fixed" it for me  but it may be totally shortsighted  looks like i should be using another backend in the first place  i saw the warning in the docs but didn't really get the meaning and the implications  my bad  sorry for the noise 
 auvipy here is a sample code that i used   what it is doing is that i wanted to implement task level concurrency locking using this token bucket implementation  i hooks to the task start   stop events and the bucket remove the token until the previous task finished  according to docs  celery is using the  expected_time  as defined above to determine when the next token would be available but it's doing it incorrectly  it just use the value returned from that function and queue the task to be run at that time completely ignoring that can_consume returns false  the correct behavior that i would expect is that celery calls  expected_time  and waits for that given amount of time  afterwards  call can_consume and if it returns  true   it will run the task  otherwise call expected_time again and repeat  also note that when celery  in current implementation  calls expected_time and schedule the task for that amount of time  when the time pass and the token bucket raise an exception  the task would be lost and never put back into the queue which can result in tasks being lost 
hi  georgepsarakis   so what i am trying to achieve is something like as under  shared_task def process_me     def my_task arg1 agr2 arg3    process_heavy_task    now i know the same can be achieved by taking the initial task request on queue   q1  and from the method process_me  i can put the task on other queue  q2 polled by 'n' workers  as my cpu cores and they can all process in parallel  i did not want to change the structure of the code  so came across a library billiard  this one apparently allows the task to create sub processes  but i am not sure if there is anything that i am missing here   what would be your take on this thanks furqan
rabbitmq 
hey george  thanks for the response  my test server has 6 cores  12 threads   which do saturate if the number of worker child processes is too high  however  we have confirmed that the problem is with redis  or celery's interface to redis   as we have tried switching the backend to memcached and are not seeing this problem with slow asyncresult get   calls towards the end  we have tested the latest version of redis  4 0 9   but that also has this problem  we are investigating the possibility that the python redis library is causing this issue  if anyone has recommendations on how to configure redis or the python redis library  v  2 10 6   any pointers would be appreciated 
just managed to test against the 4 2 release and issue still persists 
i can still reproduce it in 4 3rc1
 georgepsarakis yes  i did enable  broker_use_ssl true  in the config  i updated my post to include that  the referenced ticket talks about  rediss      it's a schema difference as far as i understand it 
the test built on osx 10 12 6  celery 4 2rc4  rabbitmq 3 7 5  config is  so  celery think that chain is in pending state  don't know whether it really finished and celery just didn't update it's internal state or task is still active  consuming worker and other resources  hope this will help 
https   github com celery celery compare v4 2 1   master
as i said  json serialization won't work for our purposes  anyway  pickle is  supposedly  supported  so how come i keep gettings this content disallowed message 
just tried with celery 4 3  it doesn't work  also  looked at cassandra py file  https   github com celery celery blob master celery backends cassandra py  the function  _save_group  doesn't exist there yet  also the function  _save_group  is only implemented in the  keyvaluestorebackend   https   github com celery celery blob master celery backends base py#l720 so  unless it is officially supported by celery  i'll have to duplicate the functionality to do save and restore myself 
ok  georgepsarakis  i will try to reproduce the error in order to provide more info 
am i correct in my interpretation of the behavior 
git+git   github com celery celery git kombu  4 3 0  auvipy same behaviour  there was great idea for patch https   github com celery celery issues 1078#issuecomment 10640176 maybe someone need to do this
at least in the immediate future  no sorry  otherwise i would have done it 
sorry about the late response because i was experimenting different ways to get this to work  thanks to the hint  i looked into the lifecycle of kubernetes pods and found out that there is this thing called " helm hook  https   github com helm helm blob master docs charts_hooks md "  that will get executed in different phases for deployment  one of the hooks that i found useful is the   pre upgrade   hook  it requires successful execution of a command specified in the hook yaml file before new pod gets deployed and replace the old pod  now my question would be  how to create an image to check if there is any tasks waiting to be processed by the worker pod 
i got some more logs  one is from rabbitmq server  it shows   client unexpectedly closed tcp connection   have a look at time   2019 05 06 15 21 06 265    every 390 seconds  will step in code   except self connection_errors as exc    i am still try to figure it out 
it's like a fs checking  it makes sure that files are not corrupted or involuntary altered  https   github com git git blob 0afbf6caa5b16dcfa3074982e5b48e27d452dbbb documentation config txt    and for now your repository seems corrupted    this link might be helpful to repair it   https   stackoverflow com questions 18678853 how to fix corrupted git repository
4 4 0rc3 doesn't fix this issue  the db model   class task resultmodelbase   https   github com celery celery blob 9ba426a0af698e574ee52b1d5197798a50c87f87 celery backends database models py#l19  does not have "children" property  it only saves  task_id    status    result    date_done    traceback   but  backends base py  https   github com celery celery blob 9ba426a0af698e574ee52b1d5197798a50c87f87 celery backends base py#l692  saves  task_id    status    result    date_done    traceback  and  children  
 auvipy pytest  5 1 1  i have listed all the libraries with exact versions
yes  same problem on master  here is the new output of celery version   4 4 0rc3  cliffs  
the problem is that i can only catch this in production  it takes at least 24 hours before this bug appears  i can still give it a shot but i'll have to build new containers to do so  rather than using the ones i'm hosting publicly on dockerhub 
i'm part of  epsagon  https   epsagon com   where we trace the calls and visualize them on a graph  we would love to put the celery logo on the graph when the users trace these calls  and we rather prefer to use an svg instead of a png 
thanks  that sounds good to me  how might this fit into the roadmap 
done  on my machine  699 tests  1874 assertions passing 
yes i will try later this weekend 
oops  apparently i forgot to run auto migrations  you can close this

yes i use master  i create a new application to isolate problem and add devise to it  everything works fine  then i add plugins and it stops  after small debuging i find the guilty  it was delayed_job  not only devise routing was not working  i get route error on any request  i to fast report an issue  sorry for that 
i tried to  but it does not reproduce on a small app with only devise  cancan  and almost the same 'page' controller  it reproduces for sure on my big app  but i have no idea  who may cause this bug  formtastic  haml  russian  stringex or friendly_id  i'll try again when will have time 
i will
it is the stock  standard views devise mailer confirmation_instructions html erb i don't get what is causing this  because until rails 3 1 this was not an issue for me  this could be my excuse to play with markerb   which looks really cool 
the config initializers devise rb file is nearly unchanged from the one generated  there is no config mailer_sender item in it  i have run rails generate devise install 
yep  i saw that  here some examples  routes rb namespace  client do devise_for  cusers     end the path stack is  1  "client_cusers mailer" 2  "devise mailer" and i think it should be  in this case  1  "client mailer"  namespace wide templates  2  "devise mailer" other example  routes rb namespace  client do devise_for  cusers     devise_for  otherpeople     end would be better with 1  "client  cusers otherpeople  mailer" or "client mailer  cusers otherpeople "  i prefer the last one  for per model templates 2  "client mailer" 3  "devise mailer"  i also have a question about scope namespace routes in rails3  since there is no "issues" for that repo  where could i ask that   
my assumption was that calling sign_in in tests would have the same effect  in terms of creating session and artifacts like calling hooks  as in real controller  at least from coder perspective  what happens inside is of course different  example use case  test for functionality that depends on sign_in_count  i guess i just have to set proper sign_in_count in fixtures  thanks for speedy answer   
without def create super end i got same error   yes i inheriting in right way class sessionscontroller   devise  sessionscontroller rails at current 3 0 stable github branch and devise at master

thanks for the quick reply  since gmail bounces back any email going to "someone somewhere co " and since there's no such domain  and never will be  as " co " i guess we're going to treat it as a illegal email regardless of what the rfc might say  i understand the reason for relaxed rules in devise  and this is a rare edge case  lots of users  only happened once  that might not be worth changing inside devise  in case anyone else runs into this  or wants to tighten the rules  here's what seems to work in our app to "tighten up" the email validation  add to user model  validates  email   presence    true   email    true so now  in addition to devise's internal validation  the model uses our custom validator  then we added a custom validator email_validator rb to app validators directory per  http   my rails royce org 2010 07 21 email validation in ruby on rails without regexp  which does trigger a validation error on the " co " case 
i am using rails 3 0 5 i have a controller to overwrite the registration controller  because i am using a different layout    so i added to the database directly 3 columns   i added this 3 columns to the list in the model user in the attr_accesible  so its looks like this  attr_accessible  email   password   password_confirmation   remember_me  phone  first_name  last_name   i modify my views   when i edit a user and add those new values it works  i can see that even in the database    when i go to  users sign_out it delete this data from database is so weird  p   
at this point i'm not sure how or where the helper  current_user  is loaded  i'd like to be able to do something like  rails generate devise helpers  and have similar behavior to  rails generate devise views   i'm guessing that right now   current_user  is loaded something like this  this would optimize how many sql statements i use to generate my views  my needs would be different in another application  but being able to customize the helper  current_user  allows me to optimize details as my application grows  i believe that others would make use of this functionality too 
will try to do it in the weekend  one more thing that need to be done  if the email used to recover password is valid or invalid  the url redirect should be the same 
sure  this is the basic recipe for most of the tests involved   i will add that the app itself runs fine  just tests fail  also  running the following  rails 3 0 7 datamapper 1 1 0 devise    1 3 1 cacan 1 6 4
i'll put together a test case tonight when i have a few minutes and submit it with a patch if that's cool 
some custom fields  is this the problem   pre  #    schema information # # table name  users # # id  integer 4  not null  primary key # first_name  string 255  # last_name  string 255  # zip  string 255  # city  string 255  # country  string 255  # username  string 255  # address  text # email  string 255  default ""   not null # encrypted_password  string 128  default ""   not null # reset_password_token  string 255  # remember_token  string 255  # remember_created_at  datetime # sign_in_count  integer 4  default 0  # current_sign_in_at  datetime # last_sign_in_at  datetime # current_sign_in_ip  string 255  # last_sign_in_ip  string 255  # password_salt  string 255  # confirmation_token  string 255  # confirmed_at  datetime # confirmation_sent_at  datetime # failed_attempts  integer 4  default 0  # unlock_token  string 255  # locked_at  datetime # authentication_token  string 255  # created_at  datetime # updated_at  datetime # admin  boolean 1  default false  #   pre 
documentation in the code  lib devise models authenticatable rb  is fine both for versions 1 3 3  which i am using  and master  actually  i found out about active_for_authentication  from there    what's interesting  documentation for 1 3 3 on rubydoc  http   rubydoc info github plataformatec devise v1 3 3 devise models authenticatable  is also correct  but something is wrong with documentation for master  do you generate it manually or is it some sort of post commit hook in github 
actually when i first used sign_in  i looked up what the code did in devise and it seemed dependent on return values from warden  i havent looked in warden when  or if  it might return false fail  will lookup and report within 24 hours  regardless of what warden returns now it may change in future to fail return false so maybe returning true for the condition above might not hurt too much  what do you think  if you close the ticket i'll understand that sign_in shouldnt be used in the true false context and update my code accordingly otherwise i'll send in a patch with test 
now it gives error  undefined method  pending_confirmation ' for #devise  mapping 0x007fa7f9a95a08
i actually do  and i overrode the passwords controller to force one through to make sure it wasn't coming from my layout  it doesn't seem to be trying to set any flash message in the  else  though  and  respond_with_navigational  _looks_ relatively straightforward  i must be missing something  do you sit on github issues  because i have _never_ seen anyone answer an issue so fucking fast     
the versions are  rails  3 0 7   devise  1 3 4   i'm afraid  i can't push the whole application to github  why did you close that issue  did you manage to find what the problem was 
yup  sorry about the delay  we're using rails 3 1 0 with devise 1 4 8  as far as the code writing a failing test  i've been trying  but can't seem to figure it out  been busy with a launch  but i'll keep at it in spare time   
thank you for the quick reply  all i'm doing is installing the gem and then https   gist github com 301a553349e0eba899dd
i did it already  thanks    
not in every case the registerable module is used  my use case is simple  i didn't want to use it because it was an admin  but i want to let the users change their password  devise's  password_confirmation  doesn't follows rails conventions  the wiki article clearly shows this is kind of a hack  i'm sure my rails expected a  confirm_password  parameter for  validates_confirmation_of  password   currently using 3 2 6 version  devise with mongoid  thanks for the support  +1 
users_root_path would be nice  since in routes rb most scoping is done by using plural  if i understand correctly
i thought it would be nice to include a note about this new method in the devise upgrading to 2 0 page  something like  any custom authentication controllers will need to include the devise  controllers  helpers module and be sure to call allow_params_authentication  in a before filter  i would not be opposed to including this in other devise docs as well   
yea i will get like email sending from  reply to email  and message to be send to mail  everything it will show as it seems i will get mail   but actually i dont get at all 
even better  a pull request with tests and a fix  https   github com plataformatec devise pull 1832
i'm following this  how to  migration legacy database  https   github com plataformatec devise wiki how to  migration legacy database  to migrate from clearance to devise  the only change is sha1 instead of md5  yes it is working fine with 2 0 4 without deprecations warnings 
sorry the gap is fairly wide  by memory 1 5 1 had the issue and when i bumped to 2 0 4 it didn't have it  tried this with no success   and                              it's all fixed sorry i am very lame at debugging cookies in ie7 it's been a very long time  wiki entry 
## problem i have several users in my db  which are confirmed  so  their token is nil  now  i am trying to register new user  in method registrationcontroller#create 
i'll get a backtrack for you in a few hours  thanks  on aug 2  2012  at 3 58 am  josé valimreply reply github com wrote 
sorry   resource  isn't nil  it's just a new object instance  we aren't subclassing or otherwise modifying sessionscontroller  i'm guessing that it's being lost because of the redirect 
i worked it out while i was trying to recreate the issue  i must not have restarted the server after i added the  confirmable option to the user model  because now when i go back and change the views back to the default they work  false alarm  sorry about that 
i tried to reproduce in a blank application with similar configurations but didn't have any success  i'll keep an eye out for it in the future though 
 josevalim  first i am one of your big fans  second i am using version 2 1 2 i didn't find any migration guide to upgrade to latest version  i know there are many changes between these 2 versions
i use devise 1 5 3  ok then what can i do if if it does not provide resource_params 
 josevalim i don't mind changing the documentation  but i guess that raises another question for me   shouldn't there then be a  confirm  function  without the bang  to confirm without skipping validation  or am i missing something 
so this is not something you have heard of or experienced  i mean it is a fairly simple setup  not sure if the query is causing a problem or the redirect  i should also mention i'm using postgresql if that matters at all  here is the request log  started post " users login" for 192 168 8 208 at 2013 05 08 23 59 53  0400 processing by users  sessionscontroller#create as html parameters   "utf8"  "✓"  "authenticity_token"  "m1kdzw4wz8gcdmitjdnf4p+lsjn87zv2arxq23jpwfw "  "user"   "login"  "grex"  "password"  " filtered "  "remember_me"  "0"   "commit"  "login"   1m 35muser load  1 2ms  0m select "users"    from "users" where  lower username    'grex' or lower email    'grex'  order by "users" "id" asc limit 1 redirected to http   192 168 8 208  completed 302 found in 87406ms  activerecord  4 3ms 
thanks for replying  josevalim  what do you mean by "explicitly configured"  maybe we could have a spree configuration setting for it to force the path 
devise version is 3 1 0 
sure
absolutely  as stated above i have the application hosted on heroku     url  http   testdomain dcmdashboard com email  moderator example com password  password
yes  as soon as i start work tomorrow i'll provide that to you 
as i was building out a sample application i realized my error  i was attempting to create a user right before i sent the email which caused it not to find a mapping for the user  i guess my issue was related to factorygirl's build method not building a user object that devise recognizes when it does its mapping lookup  this does not work 
ok  looks like i found the issue  i am using force_ssl in production  so the issue is pretty similar to this stackoverflow question  still unanswered   http   stackoverflow com questions 15163533 devise redirecting to different resource when using force ssl
sure on the way
okay    thanks for the reply and for future i'll look into contributing md before creating an issue and apology for that for this time    and can't share sample application as its private project    but can you help me the things i should be looking into to resolve this error   i got no callbacks on user model   
not 100  sure  i was just hacking an exploritory upgrade to rails 4 on a rails api app  i was seeing the error in tests and rails console it was definitely booting though  i was using the last version with token_authenticatble in so that might be a clue  even if by design imo this should raise an exception or return a token_generator that errors when creating tokens  returning nil seems a little strange
can you share me your email   i can allow access to the application  right now i cant share the link over here  regards  logan
i'm setting up a demo app  maybe we find the issue together then 
don't know  it needs to be checked 
just safari from what i can tell  latest chrome and firefox work  haven't tested ie  i will look into the cookie 
 lucasmazza that explains it  we're not using an orm  but a homegrown api client based on activemodel to handle our  very old  api  i didn't realize that our code had to provide that method  when i added it to the api client  everything works as expected  thank you so much for helping 
i knew it was a problem with rails somehow ignoring my serializer  in my controller i wrote this   basically i man handled the code to use the right serializer and it's working fine now  i'm not sure if this is the default behaviour or caused by some of the custom code i've written since i'm using emberjs for the front end  but maybe it's worth adding to the readme 
sure  i just finished it  https   github com ellyster devisebugexample
https   github com plamena devise_nested_form i made a new app but still the same issue  again removing self assign_attributes params   options  fixes it  user model  https   github com plamena devise_nested_form blob master app models user rb profile model  https   github com plamena devise_nested_form blob master app models profile rb application controller  https   github com plamena devise_nested_form blob master app controllers application_controller rb edit form  https   github com plamena devise_nested_form blob master app views devise registrations edit html erb new form  https   github com plamena devise_nested_form blob master app views devise registrations new html erb
i'm sorry  i just installed a new rails application  with a basic devise settings  and it works  i don't know what's the problem yet  but now i know that isn't a devise issue 
here is my current controller  https   github com jasper502 stackexchange blob master 28039893 registrations_controller rb and the relevant part of my routes rb file  https   github com jasper502 stackexchange blob master 28039893 routes rb if i delete the 'set_minimum_password_length' method from it the error appears  it is weird as 'clean_up_passwords' is in the devise controller also and it seems to work 
if i set email key as insensitive i expect that system won't send any reconfirmation emails  actually  this is not bug of rails or ruby   downcase      method of ruby std library  http   ruby doc org core 2 1 0 string html#method i downcase 21   and the simple solution is avoiding   downcase    method which marks attribute as changed    authenticatable rb       update   it looks like this issue can show itself on   strip_whitespace_keys   option too
we migrated over email  encrypted_password is empty due cause we want to force users to reset password anyway  created_at and updated_at

i believe this was caused by an error on my part using the parallel test suite  4 0 1 seems to work fine now  apologies 
 ulissesalmeida in the process of making the sample app  i realized my mistake   plural vs singular  i had   users  instead of   user  in the  authenticate  line  sorry for troubling you with my mistake  now i just need to figure out how to get it to correctly route to the login form at   users login  and not   sidekiq users login  
yeah there was a duplicate cookie being produced by intercom that was causing authentication problems
 sivagollapalli sure i'm using rails 4 2 6 and devise 4 2 0  i'm also using devise controllers for the actual password reset functionality  the only part that differs is that my custom user's controller just initiates the password reset email 
 prdpspkt it worked thanks   sivagollapalli thanks 
i would probably add a note to the readme after the installation migration that gives the message "you may notice that we're using a password field entitled  encrypted_password   don't panic  we are  of course  hahsing passwords using  bcrypt   by default   this field is named this way for legacy reasons and will be deprecated  and later changed  in future versions  see  link  for more details"  something along those lines  thoughts 
i solved it    this is the code on _messages layout  then render on master layout 
here's a repro repo  https   github com dinomite devise password token repro run it   try to reset the password  http   localhost 3000 users password edit reset_password_token    fq9wemk3 nhyg9r98  and see the result  i removed the fields from the reset password form  but when you submit it  you are logged in  get a success flash from devise  but the password hasn't been changed 
hi thanks for the reply here is sample app https   github com jailalawat devise_error_app i got a new error when you try to login http   localhost 3000 admins sign_in admin admin com and try to put a wrong password like 12345678902 nomethoderror in devise  sessionscontroller#create undefined method  failed_attempts' for # admin 0x007f973c5d22c8

 tegon it doesn't cause an issue  just an aesthetic thing  i've been investigating it more  and to me it looks like it's possibly a security feature of chrome  although i can't find much documentation online  i can't reproduce this in firefox

this is the rspec example   that error aligns with the rspec example  but in reality every similar example like this fails  as soon as i rolled back to 4 5 0 the error went away

i don't think i'll have time  sorry 
glad to hear it  jruby is the only dynamic language that i know of that is  1  generally platform independent  including setup   2  on parity with other implementations and i think that makes it very useful  especially for those of us tied to windows  once i got past that section  mvn  pbootstrap failed  although i haven't had a chance to dig into it to figure out what the issue is  i'll have a look at it later  fileutils rm_f just delegates to jnr posix unlink method  i wasn't very clear about that in my late night ramblings 
javafx uses it for appliation launch    i would argue that although it may not be a good idea in general  if the official ui toolkit for java going forward uses it  jruby ought to support it
it is not broken anymore  same project but with an updated gemfile works flawlessly in jruby 2 0 mode

hi  thank you for your help  the call stack showed me that i am calling pushmatrix and then popmatrix two times  so i the error is on my side i guess  just have no idea at them moment why it's called twice  offbo in use  
looks like i thought i was on 64 bit linux  when i was in 32     doh   everything works ok now 
it also took me all day to track down this bug  that code actually has   a   and   b   initialized in the project i'm working on that i copied it from  i don't care about the values of   a      b   and   c   being garbage though  that's just the minimal code i could give as an example that is causing memory corruptions elsewhere  in the tinynurbs library in this case  when glm_force_ctor_init is defined  makes sense that is might be due to different defines for glm in different files based on includes  will have a look later 
yeah  the current implementation is not very legible in comparison  it works on 32bit though  seems to be a utf8 issue    string ofjoinstring const vector string   stringelements  const string   delimiter   if stringelements empty     return ""    return std  accumulate stringelements cbegin   + 1  stringelements cend    stringelements 0    delimiter  std  string a  std  string b     const char    return  a + delimiter + b  c_str           
no  sadly not  you can see the forum thread here  where someone says he found a solution for himself  but you'll see my reply that it doesn't seem to solve it for me  https   forum openframeworks cc t xcode 10 of 0 10 1 will not build for simulators 31234
hello  thank you  here is a small project with the error  https   github com redfox14 small test  i'm sorry if its a stupid error i am new to this  
sorry but could you provide a link  my download was from the openframworks download page  and i don't see anything other what i already downloaded  i know it is probably somewhere on github  but i am a n00b 
i reinstall eclipse and plugin for ofx with use of you video instraction  also created a project but after all i have that errors   1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 442111 11399789 9e3e8f2e 939a 11e5 9d59 df5398da85e1 png

make sure you are using the  b programmable renderer  b    go to the shader example in the gl folder   the one that manipulates "openframeworks text"    add two lines in the draw function   "shader begin    shader end" right before the if statement  
i double checked     and it's weird     we where talking with  wasawi and we got different results with same example     summary   i've xcode 5 02 in osx 10 9 1       using of_084         downloaded of0 84 from website  compiling the "fileopensavedialogexample" and running release app     press  space    save dialog opens     i select a jpg file     click ok  dialog closes  now i rescale window and     shit     gl glitch comes       same same with  wasawi in xcode 6 01 and osx 10 9 5 and he can't reproduce the error       if i do the suggested changes of  oftheo in the forum   http   forum openframeworks cc t ofsystemloaddialog and ofsystemsavedialog hangs draw solved 15024 3       then load is corrected     and to correct the save i've to do the change i posted here       using github master branch     again     error on savedialog     loaddialog works ok     but save doesn't   gl glitch comes again      ¿ if i make the suggested change in osystemsavedialog  from nssavepanel    savedialog    nssavepanel savepanel   nsopenglcontext  context    nsopenglcontext currentcontext   to nsopenglcontext  context    nsopenglcontext currentcontext   nssavepanel    savedialog    nssavepanel savepanel   it works well       ¿¿ totally confused why other people doesn't see this issue      ¿ is an xcode 5 01 issue   or osx 10 9 1  ¿
nice  double spot on  i have compiled some osc examples from the of_v0 8 4_osx_release  and clearly see the win32 and posix directories under ip  i have added ofxosc with ofplugin  which created oscpack src and ip directories  but not win32 and posix directories under ip  it also added only src to header search paths  i'll create an issue there  closing this one  thanks for looking into this 
sure  the stacktrace was too big  i've to cut it in 2   error1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 161152 10863948 767948ec 7fdd 11e5 8811 dc3a0d9b0b18 png    error2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 161152 10863935 152b853c 7fdd 11e5 8e2e 16fac0ad52bd png 
i used this file  https   github com openframeworks openframeworks blob master examples video videoplayerexample bin data movies fingers mov and i have a nvidia corporation gm107glm  quadro m2000m  but also intel integrated  but as i said  i think it is a bug in gstreamer shipped with ubuntu 16 10 and is resolved in 17 04
yes i did  i followed the generic arm7 setup guide to the letter  out of curiosity how come the guide doesn’t have the compile open frameworks step that the rpi guide does  i found it in the install md file  it seems important since the  j8  xu4 has 8 cores  option is exposed  thanks  barney
i was double clicking  what's the difference 
ok  classic fallacy of induction  today i tried again and now it happened also with even sized media  and sometimes worked with odd dimensioned media   so dimension is probably not the issue  i couldn't reproduce the crash of ofvideoplayer but it doesn't load a lot of my mp4s  it's pretty random  maybe ffmpeg does a bad job converting gifs to mp4  however  i can play all of these in vlc    on of 0 9 3  direct show  i get the message "unable to call getconnectedmediatype"   on of 0 8 x  quicktime  ofvideoplayer would load the file and show correct dimensions but would contain only white pixels and a white texture  as for ofxgifdecoder  the app would freeze when trying to load certain gifs but the problem turned out to have nothing to do with the dimensions  at least i think so now   i ran it in debug mode and found out that in ofxgifdecoder  decode    ofxgifdecoder  processframes    ofxgifdecoder  addframe    ofpixels_ unsigned char   ofpixels_    ofpixels_ unsigned char   copyfrom    ofpixels_ unsigned char   allocate the allocation causes a segmentation fault  do you think it's better to post this isssue on ofxgifdecoder github  unfortunately these two issues don't even seem to be related any more    i can often decode a certain gif but can't load the mp4 and vice versa  regarding the ofvideoplayer issue it could well be that ffmpeg is the culprit    here's a link to a little test project and the media files i used  https   drive google com open id 0b2ccxpfvucjgsfnxmjfnvlhmtlk sorry for all the confusion  christof
just pulled from the of master and the issue is fixed in the current version  i was using a version downloaded from the website previously  sorry 
 arturoc the video files i have tried were all 1080p
my raspberry has internet connection  i tried using chrome go in to "http   mirrordirector raspbian org raspbian pool main g gtk+2 0 " and when i tried to find one of the link for example "gir1 2 gtk 2 0_2 24 25 3+deb8u1_armhf deb" i don't find it  so i don't know if is an internet problem 
 arturo sorry not right now  will try later 
thx a lot hamoid   you've resolved my problem  but now the problem is  " finished "poco" logname  no login name" why i need a logname  do you have an idea   greetings from france
it works well when i use the nightly builds  i used v0 9 8 before  it can also be fixed by using #undef in the conflict file  see https   github com oftheo ofxkinectv2 issues 27 thank you

i beg to agree    "status" applies to both degree of completion and availability  this suggests that perhaps the two parallel terms completion and availability might be the better titles for the two columns  another option is approval and availability  now that i've stared at it for a while i can see how the empty check boxes might raise a question about what to do  that is  whether to try to check them to confirm that there is no catalog entry  etc   this is an earlier error on my part  having proposed empty check boxes   after rethinking this  i offer the suggestion below    greatly increasing symmetry and clarity in wording and icon  in my opinion    with     representing the checked box  approval  1st column  complete catalog entry or     catalog entry complete approve format or     format approved availability  2nd column  add to catalog or     in catalog set terms or     available
1  i think locale   emailtemplates xml should be left as it is   the original state of the email templates is useful if someone wants to "reset all templates" 2  i suppose the "currently built in tools" you mentioned are tools for site admins   but it would be good to enable journal managers to tackle this issue 
indeed  we use postgesql  version 9 3 6   but the problem seems to be with forgotten on       part after inner join command  i tried to correct it and made a pull request https   github com pkp ojs commit 7d31cf8613ec2e6adc71fcf68407b045d5121c95 but i still not sure if i'm doing it in a right way  please correct my actions if needed

hi  mtub  thank you  we use only the released packages  those keys seem to have disappeared from many translations in  sumbission xml  in the 3 1 1 4 release    capture1  https   user images githubusercontent com 22288161 52396844 56385600 2ac4 11e9 95e0 f7b8b8347012 png  thus  the  submission submit availableusergroups  is   only   present in the following locales    capture2  https   user images githubusercontent com 22288161 52396837 4e78b180 2ac4 11e9 93d7 91dd54c8721f png  it is strange that now they have reappeared again in the  stable_3_1_2   the same happened with some keys in  user xml   i think it is worth investigating  also tagging  ppv1979
thank you  i pulled all these changes into our installation  i'll let you know if i see any problems 
 asmecher  i have some details now  first thing to observe is that there are 1769 submissions with review in our system  few submissions had multiple review rounds  the number of second third     rounds is 18  which sounds valid  this explains the output of the two first commands  problematic is that we have    30000   entries differing only by  review_round_id  and thus containing not much information  they were probably added by a faulty script on migration from a different system to ojs 2 4 5  an obvious question raises   how can there be thousands of duplicates in  submission_id stage_id round  while there is a unique index on exactly these columns   stage_id  was  null  for all entries and the upgrade to ojs3 sets it to  3   while multiple entries  x null x  are considered unique enough to not violate the index  mutliple entries of  x 3 x  are not possible  i consider this weird behaviour of mariadb  but probably there is a reason for that and some index configuration statement to avoid it 
file specific event logs have  assoc_type   515  as far as i can judge  no such entries are generated during migration  the submissions editorial history shows the uploads  i think that the editorial history is built from  assoc_type   1048585   right 
i don't currently have an interest in making a pull request  but wanted to simply notify any active  or official  maintainers for possible correction in a future patch  i very rarely work with the ojs code and am not terribly familiar with the system in its entirety  thank you  though 
 asmecher thank you for your interest  i do not have information on prefixes like this generally being identified as spam  but i got the above discussion with one of our editors  and we had problems with our emails being recognized as spam  i think this may be one of the reasons  i prefer to change it just in case  lack of brackets may not be a problem for us  thanks 
if possible  i would recommend having the recommend only option relevant to all stages   actions as this would make the entire process  from submission to publication  much more flexible  i understand that this means more work to address this issue  though

what is the password  ok ill try installing home brew  what is home brew by the way 
well  i updated to rvm head for a different reason  and the issue has disappeared  it however  was in the last  1 1 5   release  regardless  the problem was one of  almost  duplicate entries in the path   usr local bin  usr local  bin
i think i have whats causing the issue under os x and debian with the permissions issues even if the person is in the rvm group when trying to install a new ruby forcing them to have to rvmsudo for ruby installs or rvm updates  it _appears_ that debian is using the underlying permissions on the  usr local rvm directory for the group which is 755  now the  etc rvmrc sets umask g+w  but it seems that debian and os x both ignore that  i just don't know how to go about proving or disproving that 
 pkuczynski something like this  https   github com rvm rvm pull 4054 commits 1873ef24f1f289cb0b9fd2751348adc99a0e330e#diff e2aa477d4d8062608817e3021b4ed39d   
sorry but you lost me there  why would i need to have 1 8 installed 
i just re verified it  my  zsh files don't touch clobber   logging in on a linux console  outside of x  hence no ssh  no existing environment variables  no nothing   if rvm is sourced then  noclobber  is set  commenting out "source  opt rvm scripts rvm" in my  zshenv and  noclobber  is not set  in each case i simply log in and do a "setopt" immediately afterwards  no other commands are sent  i've also just re created the issue as this    created a new user on my system with  bin zsh as his shell   edited   otheruser  zshrc  to  source  opt rvm scripts rvm   in fact that is the only line in  zshrc    logged in as that user   setopt  shows  noclobber  to be set   edited  zshrc and removed  source  opt rvm scripts rvm    logged out and back in again   setopt  shows  noclobber  not to be set any other information i can provide  would my  zsh files help

 mpapis maybe    but at least  e g   must have  home instead of " home vlad" i think that happened after "rvm use   create 1 9 2 rpec 1"
it's for a build agent  we install several versions  i'd love to phase out the 1 9 2's but that'd take some time 
actually those two lines are the entire log file for  make log   in case you meant the entire  rvm install  sequence  here's the gist for that  https   gist github com 3754498

it is zsh 5 0 0  x86_64 apple darwin12 2 0  on os x 10 8 2  when i switch over to bash on 1 16 5 all of my gemset commands work properly  i also just double checked and none of the gemset commands seem to work  it always gives me the help screen  the rest of the rvm commands i usually use seem to work fine though 
so the process that i went through for rvm was    install gcc47 4 7 0nb2 and gcc47 runtime 4 7 0nb2 and gmake   install system wide via  curl  l https   get rvm io   sudo bash  s stable  no problems    install requirements as per rvm list   execute "rvmsudo rvm install 1 9 3"  should also mention that this command  sans rvmsudo  gets to the same point  output   and all was well 
probably none  i can't even remember a time where i used tcl tk from ruby even once on 16 11 2012 10 54  parker moore wrote

it happens both with a system installation on centos 5 9 as well as under archlinux with a user installation  i've just re verified  the change in behaviour happened on the update from 1 15 19 to 1 15 22  no  rvm hooks after_use file exists  the projects don't even have a  rvm directory   home has a  rvm hooks directory  but no after_use hook script  the  rvmrc file is trusted  i'd love to provide more details  but i don't really know what could be relevant  do you have a laundry list of items that may be of relevance 
mac os 10 8  mountain lion   both were built with the   latest  version of clang provided with xcode 4 6 
i don't alias anything  i'm using centos6  yes  cp rm mv is aliased to cp  i rm  i mv  i in redhat  this is well known  but who cares  aliases are not used by defualt in shell scripts  nor  i think  install script should force user for such obscure interactivity  should i care  as user  that ' root  rvm rubies ruby 1 9 3 p392 bin gem' going to be overwritten 
unfortunately  i tossed out p247 altogether with an rvm uninstall on it and then removing the leftover gemsets and folders manually

there are no files or directories named  rvmrc on the system   sudo find    name  rvmrc  returns empty  all users on the system have the problem  even root has this issue  the comment about a missing   rvm scripts rvm  is a red herring  i had added the line to  bash_profile following some other instructions while trying to get this to work  this obviously isn't needed in a multiuser install

hi  raelgc   thanks for chiming in  i saw the ubuntu package but initially wanted to avoid mixed mode installs in favor of per user installations  i'm investigating with my client it support  one hypothesis would be that of restrictions caused by an antivirus  i'll update the ticket and will switch the dedicated package if we cannot figure this out  thanks 
yes  multiple times  still happening

yes  it built from source okay  this bug was reporting the  presence  of a pre built package that for some reason does not install  from the original console dump   i haven't tried it again since the report 
 mpapis i had not tried that  again  had a hard time making sense of the error output   here's the result of running that command   seems like those gems didn't get migrated 
i did follow the steps there   manual run the install script which runs ok but it did give me another error message 
yes  i have used that as well  ________________________________ from  rael gugelmin cunha  notifications github com  sent  february 20  2019 2 56 am to  rvm rvm cc  bogie  author subject  re   rvm rvm  rvm doesn't update ubuntu 18 04  #4622  which command you used  rvm get stable  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github https   github com rvm rvm issues 4622#issuecomment 465526397   or mute the thread https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth at6jluy8f tdnadgygzngezhmxql5c7nks5vpsnogajpzm4bei6s  
i wasted a lot of time trying different things but couldn't find anything  i just implemented by own workaround by automatically running following command everytime i start my bash   rvm use default     dev null 
i was using this theme http   gist github com 368305  i did not like zsh overall for its experience annoyance  i had another problem with it  if you try to cd   tab   it showed me files like config_file which don't exist in my current folder  i just uninstalled oh my zsh 
i'm in linux atm but  ls  l    and  cd    then  ls  l  give the same results   pwd  gives       builtin cd home  doesn't work either   home  is sticky but  bin  and  lib  aren't 
i have  plugins  vi mode git git flow github npm osx svn history substring search zsh syntax highlighting   in my   zshrc   a minimal set would probably be  plugins  vi mode history substring search     that's it   
i'm pretty sure i did the same thing before  added to plugins and opened a new zsh terminal 
i have case sensitive completion turned on in my  zshrc  seems you can still recreate the problem without case sensitive completion turned on  in the same directory do   ls   tab   then tab again to see   a z b z c z d z  i haven't yet read http   zsh sourceforge net doc release completion widgets html#completion matching control enough to understand debug what is happening in lib completion zsh
i'm not quite understanding what you mean about the different repository from my custom folder  how would i link the two  i mean do i fork the oh my zsh repository as normal and then somehow link my fork to my separate repository specifically for the customs folder  can you lay it out a little bit more for me please  thanks for the help 
yes  i saw that but there are no examples and i didn't know the plugin must be enabled on that remote machine  all i need is some examples how you are using the plugin  i mean  how you ignite a ssh session from localhost to the remote machine that never dies by using that plugin 
hi andrew when i use sftp   i try to use autocomplete  tab completion feature  its not working   gives nothing as a result  thanks p s  do share some resources  so i start helping you guys  on tue  aug 18  2015 at 9 57 am  andrew janke notifications github com wrote  ## with regards shahid ashraf
yes they are normal 
no  i do not  perhaps there could be a fallback in this case when makefile doesn't exist to complete filenames in the directory instead 
 mcornella not sure to what option autocrlf be set 
i am using "bira" at the moment  but any theme having glyphs is not showing correctly  please find the output you requested below 
 apple_terminal true 
the cheat sheet  but at beginning cannot easy to remember the alias  if git and other plugins have the way to look the plugin locally will be good
yes  it is that  gap   i didn't know about unalias  probably should have done   i can at least use that for now to get my machine working again  don't know if there will always be an argument over these short names 
i expect it completes the software's name  i have solved it  i install zsh completions  and i write the following setting in  zshrc  so i find it run zsh completions firstly  it conflicts with the plugins of oh my zsh  understand  thank you also 
oh  vi mode  vi mode maintainer  robbyrussell     read the plugin readme file    increase zsh vi like functionality
works for me with both  venv and bare  git projects
for whatever reason it just wasn't changing the tab colour when i used it as a plugin  not too sure why tbh  have just changed it back to a script  what is the likelihood of #3617 being reverted  or changed as you suggested in #4072 
yes  i cloned that repo and ran  install sh   just today 
i'll close this issue  im not really sure what happened  but i reconfigured everything  it asked if i wanted to upgrade  i pressed  y    and just like that  all of my custom configurations were gone  painful 2 days  its all backed up double redundantly now 
 superlbr  yes  just read uninstall sh  it's actually almost the only thing to do 
hi there  thats unexpected  i am running git version 2 6 2  please recommend a working version and i can try with that  thanks 
problem is at the user configuration section 
firstly  it only exists in centos  normally  use zsh with theme "agnoster" and enable powerline  it work ok  see follow   image 2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1567113 10682077 8d7053ae 7963 11e5 871f 472626e629e7 png  but  when in tmux  the prompt seems not work correctlly    image 3  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1567113 10682078 8d87da4c 7963 11e5 94e6 4ba4149bea38 png  ps  some theme like terminalparty appears the same issue in tmux same prompt 
let me have a try  though i don't even know how to make a pull request  i am totally a novice at github   
hey  apjanke i must have missed that  yeah renaming it works   i might personally prefer unsetting the variable for future things that may  for whatever reason  use the variable they changed it to   but it works    so why not   
i have 4 8 version  the error still keeps appearing even after the updates 
thank you  this solve my problem  searching by cdablevar i found the same issue #2560  sorry for redundancy and thanks for your time 
any pointer would be helpful  thanks 
hey  i forgot to update this sooner  so  the issue was due most likely due to the config files i copied over from other machine where i owned ' home bibek ' and had omz installed  it set some variables that installer script uses  i removed the configs entirely and relogin  and then was able to install omz  thanks  closing 
 locale  in zsh   encoding seems error  how can i solve this 
in   zshrc  i have only   plugins  git   i've disabled it for a while but issue still persists 
yes  jamesboswell   is it like the interpreter sees something in the script which isn't supported by zsh and so it switches back to bash 
 rjrobinson tried that as well  does not work on all systems though  atk91 force of habit doing that  which is why i typed it out here as well
 giacomoalonzi yea that's a powerline font issue  my issue is that zsh simply looks like the normal terminal  except with a blue highlight on the location portion    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 5499880 18865123 92c0bb7c 844e 11e6 8f04 f44e0e7935fe png 
hi  zsh_theme "rkj repos" that was said in the title
hi  grawlinson thanks for the tip  i used user    and it did the trick  now where would i have to place this to take effect everytime i start the iterm2  many thanks again 
executing the installation script from within bash always worked fine on linux  one of the things the script does is actually changing the default shell from bash to zsh   in any case  the script runs in "sh" no matter if run from bash or zsh 
 trauta i'm using the  bin bash currently there is no any zsh config in  etc passwd my system is mac os x ei capitan
yes  "agnoster zsh theme"  as well as other themes  exists under " oh my zsh" folder  thanks 
in deed  the cd     works like expected  funny though  that it used to work   but it's okay now  i tried to remove the '  ' alias  but it seems to be defined using another mechanism that the normal aliases  i don't know the internal workings of ohmyzsh  how are the '  ' and '   ' aliases defined 
 mcornella sorry  i should've been more explicit  this is not with the  robbyrussell  theme  the above example is made with only two lines in my  zshrc    which uses no theme  that being said  if i add the line  zsh_theme "robbyrussell"   the same issue occurs  the issue does not occur without using oh my zsh  my  zsh   version  is  zsh 5 2  x86_64 ubuntu linux gnu   
i put  set  x  at the top of my  zshrc  i've put what it outputted in a   gist   _redacted_
i updated zsh and it seems to be working  i can't remember which version of docker i had wt   7 sie 2018  23 05 użytkownik marc cornellà  notifications github com  napisał 
➜   git   version git version 2 15 2  apple git 101 1  this is my git version  and i haven't tried it without the equal sign 
os x i did not returned to bash and stay in tab where i run curl install script that day i founded script uninstall  download in manually  chmod +x  run and that script removed oh my zsh
 mcornella  fino 
the tree was clean before this attempt to pull  i didn't try to do anything with the fetch_head yet  i'll see what i can do when i get back into the office tomorrow  it's a bit icky as the create delete operations happen as git tries to wrangle the working copy into what it thinks the working copy should be  so one might need to tip toe around the offending create+delete 
this happens as soon as i run the install script  so the zshrc should be the default one  my main  zshrc  https   github com miguelsaldivar  dot_files blob master  zshrc  is here though 
 mcornella it's not  oh my zsh  's issue 
yes
 mcornella the default shell for the root account is zsh 
personally  i am not a fan of the 6 red dots and would like to use an uncolored ellipsis  …   or       depending on how well my terminal font renders an actual ellipsis  
all other lines are commented out  i only changed the theme from default 
yes  it happens with  cmd  +  l  as well 
righteo tj  just wanted to make sure i wasn't crazy  d i don't know if it used to be anything  i just had a use for it today  but i'll let you know if it regresses at all  d
 juliangruber yah  piping could work  it's two http requests  2nd request much faster usually though cause it's internal   jonathanong the problem is these api methods would be in separate files  i'm only exporting  app  from each file to mount  so pulling them in might get messy  unless you can do something like  app post ' user'   and that would return the request response function  i guess i'm looking for a way to jump around the middleware stack using   signup  and   user  as keys that map to request response functions

roomid is just a variable stored in the session  with same request but win7 seems to get the session  and winxp does not
i realised that the error only occurs with this configuration  app configure function      app use express static __dirname + ' app'      
i'm building some dynamic router on top of express  e g  could be driven by a db   and have the user specify whether she wants the route to be interpreted as a string or as a regex  built it all  including my unit tests  and they failed because express basically treat the two cases the same  not super urgent for me  but maybe it's somewhat of a security issue  so that if you register a route from a semi authority  say an admin which can configure routers   the developer basically has to sanitize the string to make sure it doesn't match a valid regex 
i found a workaround  for people searching  i originally had something like this 
i debugged such below  req headers 'x requested with'     "xmlhttprequest" #   true req xhr #   false # just substitute req headers 'x requested with'    "xmlhttprequest" req xhr #   true
i want to catch urls like that   because of my very unique application logic  i need these to be in the same router 
either way  if you do decide to keep support for them i think it would be best to at least document it or make it behave more like expected  currently  passing an array doesn't run the parameter handlers before the array callback  my use for them is setting up middleware that runs on many routes  checking auth and ownership of objects   but it requires that the parameter handler be called first  it's understandable why it would also be removed too  but i think it shouldn't be a "half complete" support  it should either removed  or works like it intuitively should in my opinion 
a string representation of the document  like 
i do that in a view 
hi  the codova cli tries to install this  though  as you see if you look at the npm bug  other packages do so as well  here's the bug i reported to the cordova cli maintainer  https   issues apache org jira browse cb 4023 and here's the grunt plugin bug report  https   github com gruntjs grunt init gruntplugin issues 4 if this isn't the correct forum to report this issue  please let me know and i'll try to find the right place  thanks 
i wanted to configure the parent application and access the settings in the child 
i didn't know  connect logger    and it works though a little ugly  besides now i know what the  dev  log means  you are right  thanks 
well  it's really 50 50  so a third would work  a 4th would fail  5th would work  6th would fail    so it's  n mod 2    1 for n   0  even waiting a couple a seconds between the hits  or abusing it using  ab  result if 50  of the time being a 404
i learned of this from a blog some time ago that had a better explanation than the mdn text  but i can't find that reference  so here is a better example  run from a clean node repl         simple object      var triangle    a 1  b 2  c 3     for  var key in triangle  console log key      outputs  lines a  b  c     however  if you add to the object prototype  even a simple scalar variable  not a function   object prototype dummy   'x'      then the previous line  for  var key in triangle  console log key      outputs  lines a  b  c  and dummy     because 'in' iterates over 'properties'    instead use 'of' to iterate over the object keys  array  as intended  for  var key of object keys triangle   console log key      outputs  lines a  b  c  i don't see how this will break object create  as it just simply iterates over keys  not properties as intended for the code in this case  alternatively  you can use   _hasownproperty_   as suggested in the link second example  but i find that more verbose and less clear  not the original article  but this article explains it too     https   www carlschroedl com blog comp avoid for in in javascript 2014 11 05   https   www carlschroedl com blog comp avoid for in in javascript 2014 11 05

here is the error generated by the above example    the regular expression does not accept as a parameter 
i find express 4 different from express 3 i get following error
well but is this the only timeout that kills a request from the server end  or are there more timeouts i need to deal with 
this is my app js configure
thank you for rely  i mean there are a lot of plugin support i18n  but there is not a official way  are you suggesting we should handle those feature by our own  not the express 
i can't provide the actual data used  and the unfortunate thing is that the issue did not appear locally  but only on one of the test environments  the content being retrieved was 81 000 characters  80kb  of utf 8 json but the client would only receive 21 495 of those characters  the javascript array was built up in a middleware controller and then a second middleware would send it as an attachment   otherwise there was nothing special about the application 
yep  the connections were being kept alive by the agent which has a socket pool sized by default at 5 sockets  by setting agent  false in the http get options the agent is ignored and the connections are not kept alive 
i'm sorry to have bothered you  it is not an expressjs problem  the issue lies with github com caolan quip which is a response module as soon as you plug it on the app  app use quip    res status 204  send    becomes 200 before that it works as expected  i will work out the exact issue and query the author of quip instead  thanks for the suggestions  for further reference  the testcase

i don't want to make an actual request   doing so would attempt to execute the code in the controller  i'm trying to just verify the api route exists 
hello  laoshanlung  what server configuration do you mean  btw i moved this issue to here in expressjs generator#99 
hi  dougwilson    thanks i didn't notice you have travisci builds    yeah strange that is starting failing like this without any change    can you try to restart your build   for me it start failing today  i think yesterday it was still working  i was asking because maybe you'll have an idea of what is going wrong    if your build still pass i'm out of idea lol
i cannot provide a sample reproduction  for i don't know what the ids ips is sending to my site  so i will add a console log  res   in index js and wait for the next request to trigger this function call   or maybe you may want i run node with special parameters  i don't know how  that will log function agument values

i'm using webpack to compile the files to a static folder and serving them using  app use express static publicpath     so what i want to be able to do is load a new folder name from a file or database  ex  v1 0 vs v1 1  and point to that new folder location  that way i can easily switch between multiple versions of my ui 
this is the output   it seems that  ds_store is the problem  i solve it by simply delete the file  thank you  dougwilson  
hi  with path resolve i still get the same problem  in my code i log  console log 'folder' id    that is correct then i log  console log 'file'  file   this is correct too  but i do not log  console log 'path path   i think this came out from res download
woops  sorry for the delay  it was night here  night_with_stars   hr   notrab here are the versions     hr   wesleytodd happy to do that    smile_cat  here is the repo with the source code  https   github com vajahath express issue 3264 info
you are allowed to  router use function req res         and this will receive all requests that match the router  but  router get function req res         is not allowed even though you can get around it with  what i'm asking is can the router method functions behave like router use  setting the default path to ' '  maybe this i'm confused about how the express matches routes and this is not possible  it just looks ugly to check the method from the  request  argument
i tried to follow express quick start tutorial from npm page  for which i tried to use express generator to create a sample app  but when trying to use npm start command it showed me the above modules where installed by the previous npm install command  i thought maybe someone missed to write them in the script  plus the name of jade has been changed  when i installed all these modules one after another by following the error messages  npm start was working for me  this the version of express 4 15 2 
strange  i can’t reproduce anymore  must have encountered an edge case  🤔 closing this  until i can reproduce   
code looks something like this    i've cut it down for brevity   the full source can be found  here  https   github com continuationlabs celebrate blob master lib index js 
i'd start looking at something like https   github com expressjs express blob b97faff6e2aa4d34d79485fe4331cb0eec13ad57 lib request js app is rather trivial  the endpoint itself is initialized like   index js 
i guess i should have checked that first  still new  to node and express  so still learning  thanks for pointing this out 
yes  it's the aim of this issue     yes it can be good  and if it can be add to express generator too    
hi doug  thanks for the info  will open this issue on the nodejs repo  i did not update the nodejs version  updated it after this issue came up   the only significant event that happened was our hypervisors were patched for meltdown and spectre  but i don’t think that could have caused this issue  thanks for the quick reply 
i am not able to start it on another port  i get the same error  the port is not in use  i checked with netstat 
 dougwilson i don't think so  but i did the same test with a basic node server and i seem to have the same issue  at this point we are really confused 😕   maybe you can help us find out if we are doing something wrong in the way we measure the memory consumption
i found the reason  i was using electron packager with exclude command for dist and src folders  that was recursively excluding these folders  that was the reason  sorry for the lack of reply 
sorry for my english    the  documentation  http   expressjs com en 4x api html#express  says  extended  is true by default  but  it isn't correct  https   github com expressjs body parser blob 3f1b02247702c2966d33ee73610a98d54cf32fe8 lib types urlencoded js#l41 l44  in next major release of  body parser   that's why deprecated warning is shown  in current release  if  extended  isn't explicitly assigned a value   i suggested to change  true  in the default column to  unassigned  and required   
request  superagent  http  none of this package are taking care to the hand shake to a windows auth server 
in my project my static asset files are in   public   folder but static files are not taking effect  i have created a css file inside   public stylesheet     when i checked in the page source  its not loaded  i generated express framework structure using express generated command and i guess the code which serving the static asset file is    app use express static path join __dirname  'public'          i'm using node version    v8 11 3    in my local machine 
 dougwilson my use case was related to pug's  filters  https   pugjs org language filters html   specifically in the documentation there is a warning  in my case i have a filter which output depends on a cookie value  e g    markdown  filter  i want to pass different markdown to the filter depending on the cookie value  but since the filter is only rendered at compile time and the result is cached  i only get correct output once  if i change the cookie value  i get the cached result and i have no control over this behavior  i can't tell express that this view is actually different because of the new cookie value  if it's still not clear what i mean i'll be able to provide a demo app later this week 
my fault  the versions are –  express   express 4 16 4      confirmed  the behavior is the same  i've updated  the test repo  https   github com alaz express req header binary commit c3de5d9cd8853b4befe6561194ab00735e6a964f  
i've tried setting the x forwarded for in my nginx reverse proxy  but it's still responding with 127 0 0 1 for the hostname
thanks for the fast reply  i honestly don't think there's much hope in reaching people in my position  we use express as dependency wrapped inside a bunch of conventions about how we want to do microservices  so it's part of a much larger meta package  this meta package depends on a non locked version of express  so we've now been getting the 4 17 0 for any new projects we create and any old project that updates its dependencies  we could certainly have found the issues by testing ahead of time  but there are so many dependencies to keep track of  and we just honestly do not keep track of what's to come in any of them  i don't think you could have prevented this from happening through any reasonable communication means  we will generally only be looking at new dependency versions when we need to  not as a forethought kind of thing  i'm a little torn about whether to fix our meta package's use of express or whether to ask you to revert anything  there's an easy fix of using  response statuscode   undefined  instead of  response status undefined    so we're in no way stuck  if you want to pin down the old behavior of accepting undefined  something that was never explicitly mentioned   neither as allowed nor disallowed   i'll draft up a mr for a new test  i'll take a stab at that today or tomorrow  it's nearing end of workday in denmark 
hello  first  i am sorry for the cross posting  i didn't realize that body parser was a subproject of express  i will be more careful in the future  thank you for your linked response  when i added the type check then it parsed as it should  thank you and have a good day 
thank you for the quick response  yes  i want to be able to serve files out of the folder  for example     static   0 9 +  style 0 9 + js  would match  static 1 style 2 js and that file would be at   users user test dist style 2 js 
let me tell you what i'm trying to do  i have an input field where a user will search for something  the form will submit the result on the same page  that's why i needed to use the first if statement  then comes the inner code  if there's a query then it will match with the regex  and search for the result  the same logic goes in the second if statement  sorry to bother you mate but i am still learning nodejs and express  could you suggest an easier way to make it work where i don't have to use res render so many times 
i have something sketched out here  https   github com scroyston xsbt tree 0 9 most relevant files  https   github com scroyston xsbt blob 0 9 interface src main scala xsbti api definition scala https   github com scroyston xsbt blob 0 9 interface src main scala xsbti api definitionorderings scala https   github com scroyston xsbt blob 0 9 interface src main scala xsbti api graphcompare scala  i realize there is some sort of 2 7 dependency madness that is forcing the definitions to be in java  but this seemed the fastest way for me to prototype something  for each definition type  classlike  typeparameter  path  etc  i have a unique registry and insure the objects are re used shared  this should drastically cut down the memory usage  for example  just one particular top level protobuf class takes up 2 3mb of memory in definitions  and there are a few protobuf classes like that   and all of my 18 sub projects depend on protobuf  with the registry  sameapi should also get a lot faster  because you can shortcut on x eq y  i also added stable sorting to the definition types  to speed sameapi up by not having to do the n 2 check on the items  i also abstracted out the sameapi to a graph compare   though it's not currently correct  i don't pull child definitions out of arrays  currently  the basecheckapi fails with a bunch of stackoverflows  i assume that's why you have the lazy stuff  i took it out because i wasn't sure what it did and it complicated the registry lookups   my current plan is to try using an explicit stack instead  i thought about propagating up the typevars stuff through the definitions  then you could do something like  if  x ne y    x hasnotypevars  return false else recursive definition check on children let me know if any of this helps  less likely   or doesn't make sense  more likely     
good point  eed3si9n  i had some dependencies in my project and seems i didn't test it quite well  did a rerun and incrementally added some of our dependencies  i found out that   "net logstash logback"   "logstash logback encoder"   "1 3"  was causing the trouble  upgraded to 3 3 and it was fixed 
the problem i was having is that the shell that i am using has it's own  home  different that the one given by java lang system getproperty "user home"     so you are right  it's not a bug   
thanks   eed3si9n and  harrah for the speedy resolution 
i don't know how to set up a repository   i remember looking into this a while back and being pretty bewildered  maybe i'll eventually have another look  but at the moment this is a low priority issue  for me   since the workaround is easy   just remove the sources 
the error was  https   groups google com d msg scoobi users dxtozj8b9as 16wiire7 x8j where "package hadoop" is a task that is provided by our plugin  so instead of sbt loudly complaining that the plugin couldn't be downloaded  it instead complained of the task not being available 
are we talking about  sbt files or  scala  i'm of the opinion that  scala files should absolutely not have autoimports  and by the time  sbt files are processed  the project object should be configured with autoplugins  i kind of expect  on mon  jul 14  2014 at 10 13 am  josh suereth notifications github com wrote 
the point was that the api phase is run after the typer  if i understand correctly  that means that the typer didn't need those symbols  or i would have gotten a type error  and the api phase wouldn't have run at all   so it seems to me the api phase is more eager than the typer  maybe i'm missing something 
the annoying thing is that it won't happen every time  it's part of our test suite  the example is pretty small  my guess is that the  typesymbol  in question is the annotation 
 duhemm how would this work with the new filewatcher  https   github com sbt sbt issues 3369#issuecomment 318007542
i'm not  it seems to be pulled in transitively by scripted 
by just doing it last  procedurally 
i'll have to look into it  it should work for linux and mac  but windows is a big question mark for me  i'll also look and see if there's any already existing sun misc signal replacement that i could make a shim for that sbt could use in the meantime
creating any project with dependency "com twitter"    "finagle stats"   6 3 0 would repro this bug  i'm also finding this bug for specs  here is the sbt project file for finagle https   github com twitter finagle blob master project build scala all the uses of withsources   in this project def seems to lead to this bug  i tried sbt 0 12 1 to 0 12 3
ideally it'd be per test  since teamcity supports displaying statistics about test speeds and it can be helpful  it wouldn't be a precise benchmark  but over a bunch of runs it might reveal patterns about slowdowns and such 
i just had a teammate hit this on another project with different libraries 
oops  sorry 
damn   i can't reproduce it any more as well  i swear it was there  it must be related with something else in the environment then  like the version of java or scala or something  we're using play 2 1 5  sbt 0 12 3  if i can ever reproduce this  i'll update and re open  thanks 
ah yes  of course    i'm on a mac   osx 10 12 6  just using the built in terminal app  i'm also using zsh 5 7 1  x86_64 apple darwin16 7 0  java is   if there's anything else useful that i didn't think of  let me know 
your page is nice and readable and i think this would be a big improvement over the current style  2014 03 26 17 23 gmt+01 00 eugene yokota notifications github com 
it fails pretty quick 
to run the project  sbt run   activator run port listening   as i write play application  i need to run it  that mean i need to be able to run an http service an get response from my service  to do that i need to execute command  i've mentioned in the first line  please do not hesitate to ask me if you have any other questions  thank you  igor on oct 12  2014 7 41 pm  "josh suereth" notifications github com wrote 
sorry  now i don't have time for this 
i can send you privately my project config if it helps  btw  i'd like to have any feedback from issue https   github com sbt sbt issues 2203 i've made some research  i can try to increase the stack size 
currently no  but it is possible to exists two repository server in one machine  in other hand in sbt official documentation  not mentioned that port is not needed  if it is intentionally it should mentioned in docemantation   http   www scala sbt org 0 13 docs publishing html and i am spend many time to find that 
i believe i found the issue and it was my stupidity in ordering of version vs version in thisbuild 
by sbt 0 13 8 msi
after looking at the _maven metadata xm_ i noticed the latest artifact version was in fact listed as _0 0 3 snapshot_  the artifact was published with sbt and it used to work with 0 13 8  i'll look into why the version is not updating when publishing to nexus from sbt  thank you 
i could try to reduce it to some minimal reproducer    but  i just discovered that it is indeed trying to resolve the dynamic revision against our internal artifactory server    verbatim   
ok  have moved there 
no  we do not use it  we only have a forwarder for it in  crossproject   https   github com scala js scala js blob v0 6 9 sbt plugin src main scala scala scalajs sbtplugin cross crossproject scala#l264 l270 i'm equally fine if you drop it  in which case we'll drop our forwarder 
sorry  my fault  my private artifactory proxy need authentication  i didn't notice that  sbt  needs additional  sbt_credentials  env or boot args to specify the credential property file  it's working now  but the  link  http   repo typesafe com typesafe ivy releases org scala sbt sbt   show no greater version than  0 13 9   that's strange 
i agree  but unfortunately sometimes when developing with multiple developers and different environments it's necessary  i'm using sbt 0 13 12 and i'm publishing to a internal maven artifactory  jfrog  and that does have that maven meradata xml  maven metadata xml zip  https   github com sbt sbt files 393941 maven metadata xml zip  as you can see in the metadata xml the remote version is from last week  the  ivy2 local version doesn't have any metadata but was published locally this week  today   since the local version is from a later timestamp it should use this one and not the one from remote 
yes https   github com scalameta scalafmt commit 4a5aa605321214e7474a8a3c0221179d8e178033#diff fdc3abdfd754eeb24090dbd90aeec2cer107 but only for the  sbt scalafmt1  project  not the  core  project which  sbt scalafmt1  depends on  should  scalacompilerbridgesource  be enabled in all projects that  sbt scalafmt1  depends on 
works now  thanks 
i followed your suggestion  however  it doesn't change the behavior  all the java code gets compiled four times  here's a transcript of the  crosspaths  and  crossscalaversions  settings   the root project is the only aggregation project and the  scalaapi  project is the only scala project  all others are pure java projects  except for their test code  but that doesn't get published anyway  
you mean the sbt version within my project build properties or the sbt version within my environment 
 dwijnand it appears moving to 0 13 16 seems to be fine for sbt  i tried the latest sbt  but i think that was too much of a jump for the project 
all 4 steps work fine at home on a different ubuntu 16 04 computer  i'll try the work computer tomorrow if i can get it on a non work network   
as i said   it happened once during  sbt compile   i just thought it is worth to inform you about it 
intellij version 2017 2 2 scala plugin version 2017 2 11 and sbt 1 1 4 scala version 2 12 6 i have also tried it on intellij 2018 1 but it still gives the same error 
 eed3si9n thanks for the reply  actually i would be fixed that already in my local and would suggest the solution  but sadly i don't have that much of powershell experience as well  if i got time to see how i can fix that  i might be pushing a pr 
whoops 
i can share the pipeline i use to run the analysis  but that might be a bit overwhelming  perhaps just getting a few sbt projects and building them in parallel   i use gnu parallel to run  sbt compile  using 2 12 parallel jobs depending whether i'm on my workstation  32gb ram  or server  256gb ram   in both cases i see the same behavior 
sure  created  https   github com foundweekends giter8 issues 414
now i'm also not able to reproduce it  confused    _deus ex machina_   intervened  i guess 😃
 eed3si9n thanks for looking into this  eugene  i'd also like to take the opportunity to thank you for all your great work on _sbt_ and its plugins  also  _scopt_ is a fantastic tool that i use a lot  thanks  given that a _library dependency_ is a library upon which an application depends to run  it seems reasonable to assume that that is still the case even if it happens to identify a _jigsaw_ module  so even if you don't expect it to work right now  i hope you agree that it _ought_ to work      it's a good question how other build tools access modules  so far as i can tell  _maven_ seems to treat modules as just regular  library dependencies  http   maven apache org ref 3 6 1 maven model maven html#class_dependency   and there don't appear to be any new tags to support modules   it doesn't help that _maven_ uses the term _module_ to mean different things  though   i'll look into that some more    it appears that _jar_ files for library dependencies can be identified as modules if they contain a  module info class  file in their _jar_ root  aside from any support the _java_ 9+ _api_s might offer   but this begs the question why the _jvm_ still needs the    module path  and    add modules  arguments if each _jar_ is already accessible on the classpath  would it be a valid fix for _sbt_ to recognize such _jar_ files as modules  if it also detects the use of a 9+ _jvm_ for the build  and add them to the    module path  _jvm_ argument for forked processes automatically   the    add modules all module path  option appears trivial by comparison  
 eed3si9n yes  i'll prepare a pr during the weekend 
thought i would give you this information 
using easy install on the latest version  digi604 django cms 2 0 63a124c
wow that was fast  i'll have to check it this evening
well this came up when we had to go through some domain verification with yahoo  where they ask you to place a certain file  with a certain name  with a certain meta tag  at a certain spot on your server  that file they wanted us to use had a period in it  and needed to be at the root path of the site  obviously i could have setup a rewrite in nginx for that path  and pushed them somewhere else  however  it was just as easy to create the page in django cms  add the meta tag  and be done with it  after i allowed for periods in the page names 
i've tried three times to reproduce with no luck  if i can reproduce the issue i'll post a new issue 
yeap  in the admin  well  it seemed a common use  as the link field gives you a hyperlink to the image to have a way to edit it's rel  just the first line of the default template woulf have to change  something like this works     if link    a href "   link   " rel "   picture rel   "    endif    in the model  the change is very slim too 
no  everything that should be rendered is rendered  just rendered incorrectly  i can not enter text but i can press the 'save' button and the    tags  but nothing happens 
by sheer brute force  i'm using this on a french english site   essentially  it's concatenating the rendered text of all a page's plugins  regardless of language  and searching across the result  if any text in any language matches  it returns a link to the result in the appropriate language  a more elaborate solution with indices for each language would be nice  i'm not sure that's possible with haystack   but i found this superior to available alternatives   especially when it's necessary to index custom apps alongside 
see http   github com digi604 django cms 2 0 issues issue 508 
yepp  and as far as i've seen it works    but still  copying single plugin would be nice imo  our case  10 paragraphs with similar contents  movie showing times    as 10 plugins benefits of splitting over 10 plugins  easy reordering  easy deletion   content is being changed every week by non technical staff
pull request #3661 fixes the problem  however  i haven't had time to write a thorough test case to prove the existence of the bug and that this pull request fixes it  this is largely because the bug can only be triggered through the front end editing flow  the api  which the other tests rely on heavily  doesn't support moving plugins  and i haven't had time to figure out how to get the through the browser tests written using the current django cms infrastructure   patterns  up against a deadline but should be able to circle back in 2 3 weeks unless some other kind soul who is more familiar with the test suite gets to it first 
the latest  3 2 3  i have a minimal project you can use    https   github com jsma cmstest tree fcac9d0812104eeb2f79fe2c7f822ccd66125161
concrete thing  there is no generic way to get an absolute url inside a plugin to a page  or something else  using this plugin  for example  in my plugin used in a cmsplugin blog entry model i would like to know in which entry my plugin is used so that i could get an absolute url back to it displayed  now  i could traverse hierarchy and get to the placeholder  the problem is that placeholder is not necessary in a page  if it is  then it is simple  but if it is not  then you have to find which model it is connected with  even if you manage this  by traversing all   _set  fields  you have a problem that sometimes it is not enough to get an absolute url  for example  in cmsplugin blog you get entry model  but  absolute_url  is defined with a related model entrytitle  so the idea was that it would be much easier if you would be able to get application directly  then you would know which field set to search for  or even this app could have some new method defined to help you with that  so currently there are better api for using plugins placeholders outside of the pages missing

sorry for not replying sooner  since currently any page editor  with or without editing permission on the current page  can switch between structure and content view by pressing spacebar it is reasonable to show content structure button  also  if and when restriction is introduced it should be in such way that it affects both interfaces i e  button and keyboard shortcut

nevermind  i took the fact that it was listed separately from the main module to mean that it was optional  the docs are accurate

thank you for your quick response  just tried to get latest dev version running  but it seems that i'm something missing  because this results in an error  sorry but this is my first django project   tried to test with the following steps  1  made backup of mysql database  2  made backup of cms folder in   env lib python2 7 site packages  3  installed dev version via  pip install git+https   github com divio django cms git develop#egg django_cms 3 0 0beta2  4  run  python manage py syncdb  5  run  python manage py migrate  after doing this  i get the following error after restarting the server 
i will try and mock something tonight to showcase the issue  it shouldn't be hard to replicate 
certainly 
i can't imagine so  i'm a superuser   the toggle button is visible on all other pages i've looked at  i think this could be some kind of odd caching issue  i just kept toggling live draft and it appeared  then phoned a colleague to say i'd got it to appear that way  toggled it again  and now i can't get it to show up again  theres nothing in the console to show js errors  so i'm at a bit of a loss here 
they're in after cms  which is what i've always had in my 1 6 projects 
this seems to be fixed in  3 0 4  with the toolbar refactoring 
tried support 3 0 x branch  and it's still an issue there 
it's certainly not because of funny symbols being committed but how certain browsers are handling the line of code i indicated  i have over 10 confirmed computers in our company that demonstrate this behavior  my guess it has to do with multiple script tags in a single  write   if i roll back enough  i see it was introduced in this commit  https   github com divio django cms blob 06f89bf4180d30d94d0c55534f7e100eb0fb0292 cms templates admin cms page close_frame html
 mkoistinen   yakky is right  this tool isquite simple and removing default language code from url  i think url's are quite problematic in django cms  it is a good idea to in the same step remove problem with  1  if you change url of existing page you will receive 404 error   becouse system will not redirect you to the new address but stay at the same page  which was pernamently moved  2  same like on 1st point will give you 404 after page removal  i think it should redirect you to main page  3  when you move page in a structure as a child of another page system is for a long time giving wrong url  somewhere is stored old url 
we could fix the problem by including admin site urls into i18n_patterns in urls py  you can close the ticket 
fine  so i put refactoring the view on my own todo list and make a pull request some time 
 evildmp i tried several things    yes  it seems that the target page is the problem  what could help next 
i can't reproduce the problem in my system but end users keep complaining  will get more information shortly  are there any updates notifications sent from the server to a web browser where the sidebar panel is open  which might force the admin ui to refresh the sidebar because somebody else is changing the site pages structure

this was using 0 12 1 on ubuntu 14 04 x64 installed with the debian package  the same issue was also present in the latest dev build  i'll get a complete stack trace when i get into the office  from my understanding  the other issue is casued by having too many files open at one time  if the header footer also has images it has to load  this would add even further to reaching the file limit  wouldn't it be beneficial to either close the files when done with them  or store the contents of the file in memory 
those one from your "download page"  windows  mingw w64  32 bit   compatible with xp 32 bit  i need maximum compatibility   i tried to run the converter under windows 7 64 bit  also windows 7 32 bit   d  wkhtmltopdf bin wkhtmltopdf  v wkhtmltopdf 0 12 1 2  with patched qt  ps i discovered that output is picture  png    not pdf  but anyway it is broken 
unfortunately no  when i use for example    dpi 300  the output is the same  so the issue seems directly related to the windows scaling setting  maybe due the underlying qt libary   
thank you for the reply  hmmm it returns another font   pre  # fc match sans serif n019003l pfb  "nimbus sans l" "regular" # fc match serif n021003l pfb  "nimbus roman no9 l" "regular"   pre  by using  pre  fc list   grep  i "nimbus"   pre  i found that this font is indeed installed into the system  by checking where this particular font file is with  pre  fc list  v   fonts txt   pre  and then searching in the file for these two fonts i got this   pre  family  "nimbus sans l" s  style  "regular" s  slant  0 i  s  weight  80 i  s  width  100 i  s  foundry  "urw" s  file  " usr share fonts default type1 n019003l pfb" s  index  0 i  s    pre  and  pre  family  "nimbus roman no9 l" s  style  "regular" s  slant  0 i  s  weight  80 i  s  width  100 i  s  foundry  "urw" s  file  " usr share fonts default type1 n021003l pfb" s  index  0 i  s    pre  which indicates the fonts are installed in the system  and by searching for the files indicated by strace  timr12 iso8859 1 pcf gz and timb24 iso8859 1 pcf gz  i got   pre  pattern has 17 elts  size 32  family  "times" s  style  "regular" s  slant  0 i  s  weight  80 i  s  width  100 i  s  pixelsize  17 f  s  foundry  "adobe" s  antialias  fcfalse s  file  " usr share x11 fonts 100dpi timr12 iso8859 1 pcf gz" s  index  0 i  s  outline  fcfalse s  scalable  fcfalse s  charset  0000  00000001 ffffffff ffffffff 7fffffff 00000000 ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff  s  lang  aa ast ay bi br ch da de en es eu fj fo fur fy gd gl gv ho ia id ie io is it lb mg nb nds nl nn no nr oc om pt rm sma smj so sq ss st sv sw tl ts uz vo wa xh yap zu an fil ht jv kj kwm li ms ng pap an pap aw rn rw sc sg sn su za s  fontversion  0 i  s  fontformat  "pcf" s  decorative  fcfalse s    pre  and  pre  pattern has 17 elts  size 32  family  "times" s  style  "bold" s  slant  0 i  s  weight  200 i  s  width  100 i  s  pixelsize  34 f  s  foundry  "adobe" s  antialias  fcfalse s  file  " usr share x11 fonts 100dpi timb24 iso8859 1 pcf gz" s  index  0 i  s  outline  fcfalse s  scalable  fcfalse s  charset  0000  00000001 ffffffff ffffffff 7fffffff 00000000 ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff  s  lang  aa ast ay bi br ch da de en es eu fj fo fur fy gd gl gv ho ia id ie io is it lb mg nb nds nl nn no nr oc om pt rm sma smj so sq ss st sv sw tl ts uz vo wa xh yap zu an fil ht jv kj kwm li ms ng pap an pap aw rn rw sc sg sn su za s  fontversion  0 i  s  fontformat  "pcf" s  decorative  fcfalse s    pre  so from what i could understand  it appears the font being used to render the file is "times"  possibly not truetype  because it is fixed at 100dpi   so that's why the render appears "ugly"  but the fc match command returns nimbus  which again by what i could understand is a type1 font  which is vector based    it would result in a good file  why isn't wkhtmltopdf using it  and instead it is looking for this times "bad" font 
are you asking me about the original image or the generated files 
mainly because the page breaking over table rows still isn't sorted for me  though i'm going to be upgrading the version of wkhtmltopdf today now we have a public holiday here in the uk  however there are a couple of other reasons  1   a particular requirement for this project is that a page break can only occur after every _other_ table row  2   page break inside  avoid isn't working 
 jhackney do you have 'qt' project in the main directory  along with 'scripts'  'src' and others   
the source html being converted  and the css  images  etc  are all local files  so it shouldn't have gone to the network for anything  _within_ the html there are links to a half dozen or so external sites  java  selenium  and a few others     would those have been accessed at all  if so  why didn't i get the malware warning each time  the warning said only that htmltopdf was trying to access the network  and didn't give the url it was supposedly trying to reach  is qt or wkhtmltopdf periodically trying to reach a site for updates or news  that would be acceptable  so i can at least reassure my client that nothing nasty is going on 
i'm using wkhtmltopdf version 0 12 1  with ruby on rails 4 2 1 i will send you the html for a test case tomorrow 
 shamitv after deeper investigation i have found out that the root cause is not wkhtmltopdf instead it is related to pdfkit  i haven't found a solution yet and am trying to get help from the pdfkit authors on this  thanks very much 
i don't know how to do that 
see my update
 philterpaper   thanks for the reference    header spacing and   footer spacing is a workable approach  however the   header line and   footer line should generate the line based on the font size specified so that external calculation is not needed to determine the correct mm 
 getz85 no  although  to overcome this  not ideal  i'm having to output the pdf as a a0 size  over a4   this gives a good proportion and resolution  but the pdf is on a bigger print scale 
 philterpaper thanks for the response  the icons are displayed correctly in chrome and ie  i've double checked this  i see the them like an image  locally  for example  if i put this ☕️ in notepad i see correctly  so that let me think that i have all the fonts that i need locally  i don't have any idea how to resolve the issue   i tried also this  https   github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf issues 1734 but it didn't work 
hello    thanks for your reply    this is the page i am trying to render  http   xoks net  the wkhtmltopdf doesn't output the first line and displays the second line with an error  everything else seems to be working  this is the command line i am trying to run  wkhtmltopdf   encoding utf 8 http   xoks net  xoksnet pdf thank you one more time 
hi  i upgraded my wk version to 0 12 3 recently  according to the follow links it says the recent version of the exe has able to resolve the relative links  but i still have the issue means its working proper with absolute urls but not with relative urls  https   github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf issues 1843  url  and  https   github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf pull 2341  url  this is how my header is referencing the css files link href "  xxx content sample css" rel "stylesheet" type "text css" and i have mentioned the following arguments for the exe   args append "  resolve relative links "   args append "  enable external links "      ashkulz  kaylukas   can you guide what else am missing here 
sorry for the delay  here is a copy of the pdf file that is generated  ais_4083386599242298613 html pdf  https   github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf files 554338 ais_4083386599242298613 html pdf 
sorry  i was not very precise  version 0 13 alpha is lacking support for command line options like   header html   footer html   no header line   no footer line   header spacing   footer spacing   no pdf compression despite these missing command line options wkthmltopdf is working fine in version 0 13 alpha  even in combination with mathjax formulas  do you have any release plans for 0 13 stable  many thanks for your support and immediate responces   +1 
hi  i do agree  this is weird  but also very common  nginx proxy is listening on eth0 with x x x x  and since the host file contain 127 0 0 1 domain tld it would make the request on the local interface and nginx would redirect it to default virtual host  i can't change the host file and the reverse  so i've to deal with this  this issue only happen when i'm working on the remote server of course 
 philterpaper thank you adding in the character encoding meta tag to the html passed in solved the issue 
maybe  no 
thanks for your replies  i believe it is something to do with the https delay  however i have tried the   javascript delay option which didn't help  it is weird because when i run in terminal i can see the process takes a while to run  compared to say outputting google com  but it just appears that it is writing to pdf while the page is still loading  i've got around this by loading a http  not https  version of the pdf on the server  and download that copy over https  this means https integrity is intact  but it doesn't answer the question of why using the https version of the report fails when the http version does not 
i did also use libwkhtmltox unfortunately it has the same problem  only works once  at least on the windows build for me  assume the clean up code does not clean up properly would be nice to track it down  i think calling wkhtml multiple times is slow compared to looping on a loaded library 
i am using linux os  i am using default fond package linux  also install japaneses  marathi  hindi  ttf font on server 
yeah  that's definitely the first thing which i'm going to check as workaround  but it would be cool to fix the way how this tool parse unicode parameters  the root problem   this will solve all sort of problems  like inability to convert files with unicode names  etc  
the html files are generated at runtime so that the files used to compose the pdf  like  file     tmp wicked_header_pdf20180420 31485 1t0t18d html   do not exist on the disk  is there a way to test it 
 alloylab wtf bro  i have mentioned the version and also the specifics in the original post  i'm on ubuntu obviously  using nginx  don't think it matters whether i'm on nginx or apache  you simply just want to close issues without resolving them  
windows 8 64 bit  updated to 0 12 5 and still same result
wkhtmltopdf 0 12 5  with patched qt  distributor id  ubuntu description  ubuntu 16 04 3 lts release  16 04 codename  xenial x86_64 version 0 12 5 didn't fix the issue 
you can see the html css source  here  https   budgetvideo com print catalog html  normally i don't use html tables for layout but in this case it was easier to handle the columns and page breaks with tables 
thanks for re  i just want to make the font of the watermark a little skew  there is this style on html  but i change to pdf  and this style is lost  running on windows  version is 0 12 5 this is my html  the style is work    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 28617648 42992241 8fb836b2 8c3a 11e8 930e 610a85bf19eb png  this is after changed the style is not work on pdf    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 28617648 42992071 18e6fee2 8c3a 11e8 810b 542437150bc8 png  could u show me your html resource  i think something wrong on my html  
hi  thanks for the replies  i tried with 3 versions  stable  0 12 5   bleeding edge  based on qt 5 4 2  and 0 12 0  sadly  all of them resulted in the same problem  when trying to replace   windows status with   javascript delay 10000  ten seconds   i get the following output   it generate a pdf without the font since it can't fetch them from the internet but that's not a problem  i also don't understand where the 6 pages come from since i only have one in my final pdf  
 ashkulz i cloned the entire project if that's what you mean  can you clarify what submodules you're referring to 
thanks for the help  version update did solved the issue  can you point me where i can download the latest executable of wkhtmltopdf  thanks 
1  when we enter the lengthy content in middle of the pdf page   0 12 5 version automatically goes to next page  2  and its showing empty space looks ugly 
same result i'm afraid
 render this page   https   www instagram com p bnlvccanta3bitva_dqbcq1q2k5k ru_zxa3og0   and i have got a white image with 20px height only  my version is  "h4cc wkhtmltoimage amd64"  "0 12 4"  
note   "how to reproduce"   in the ticket  it's  wkhtmltopdf  for all 3 cases  win32 win64 mac  please try them against that public site 
right  i'll put the blame on php for being retarded    i still think the phpunit 3 5 15 behavior was better    thank you for looking up this issue
as a temporary workarround i run all tests using this command   find    name " _test php"  type f  exec phpunit          test single file    what i notice so far is as long as the target directory does not contain any subdirectories  phpunit process all test files within that directory  otherwise it fails silently  i just clone phpunit from github  and i update my local repo whenever new updates are available 
i confirmed that phpunit_selenium 1 0 2 fixed the problem  thanks for the quick turnaround 
## this is the phpunit xml file contents    xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"         id  phpunit xml v 1 6 2010 01 26 00 20 56 dstockton exp        phpunit backupglobals "false" backupstaticattributes "false" colors "false" bootstrap "includes autoloader inc" converterrorstoexceptions "true" convertnoticestoexceptions "true" convertwarningstoexceptions "true" processisolation "false" stoponfailure "true" syntaxcheck "false"     phpunit     
i can totally understand bc   which was why i suggested this method as a workaround  anther option would be getmockdisableconstructor     
but then    why are they outputted in such way that they are not parsed by the console 
 whatthejeff thanks  it is fixed 
well  i have since found the following will work 1  move to  app tests directory 2  execute following  code         vendor bin phpunit   colors   debug exampletest php  code  it seems that the install of phpunit is either not using some phpunit xml file  not sure where it is looking 
 whatthejeff  phpunit definitely ignores stderr  and the missing data that makes the test fail is definitely in  jobresult 'stderr'   this should work  if one of those ini settings is supposed to make it so the error goes to stdout instead  that would be a separate issue to file against hhvm 
sure  see https   github com wittestier bmk_server blob dev master module application test phpunit xml
sorry man  about last 3 week i have not free time at work to play with phpunit 
thanks for the quick response  i will update to 4 2 2 right away 
yep of course  i'll do that tomorrow

5 4 5 is ok 
 sdudziak version  4 0  i think it's the same for  5 0 too  note  i've look at the code and it looks like this is not a bug  but rather a feature request and an issue with the documentation and the description of the    testsuite  option  for example  if the description of    testsuite  is changed from   does this makes sense 
how could i miss this feature  thank you for pointing to it  this makes my feature request superfluous 
yes  this does solve the problem nicely and kudos for being so fast in replying to tickets  👍
yeah  i can do that
i don't now the specification  but with the warning from sonarqube i suspected the format was wrong   sonarqube  warn  test cases must always be descendants of a file based suite  skipping   some importanttest sometestcase with data set #1 in some importanttest sometestcase  sonarqube  warn  test cases must always be descendants of a file based suite  skipping   some importanttest sometestcase with data set #2 in some importanttest sometestcase
no  it happens with phpunit 7 and phpunit 8 stable releases as well  i've updated repository composer json to use stable phpunit 8 4 3 
yup  during a first boot operation of a node that is being bootstrapped  the logs don't get saved anywhere  there are situations where the only time chef will be run on a node is during that bootstrap  because the node might be relatively ephemeral  or the client might decide that chef is only used to install the software and not to do long term maintenance with chef  then there's the factory model  where you bootstrap a new node with a factory role  and then it is responsible for going to bootstrap all the other new nodes that need to be created  in that case  there is no way to pass the log_level or log_location information down from knife into the factory node that is being bootstrapped  or to pass that information down from the factory node to all the other nodes that are going to be bootstrapped  log information can be critical  both log_level and log_location are things that we need to be able to communicate from our chef workstation through the bootstrap process to the node being created  and through that factory node to all the other nodes that are going to be bootstrapped 
 lamont granquist i do want to make sure the system can tell the difference between a real default value and a sentinel  so that we  property_is_set     reset_property  and patchy resources can do their job easily  my proposal would be almost exactly the same as yours  except i would add an  unset_value  to properties to say what the sentinel value is  it would always have a value  and would default to  nil   that means that if  for example  if the default is a lazy calculation  the  variable would stay set to  nil   but when you asked for the value it would get the default  call the lazy calc   your examples would become   these examples could be given defaults  even lazy ones   and the default values would be required to pass all the same rules as the unset_value  like   property  version  integer  unset_value   unset  default  lazy   calc_default_version    
imho remount should be left alone and the 'mount' action should do a remount if options change on an already mounted device  this would provide the expected behaviour without breaking possible remount use cases 
 lamont granquist unfortunately  it seems to give the same result where gulp still fails to run on my vm  this issue seems unique to gulp as i can use the "execute" resource on other commands that involve " " and they work alright  here's what my bash resource looks like 
thanks  btm for responding  following is the ruby block  during the chef client run  i can see the value being set correctly through "puts" output  but the attribute is not persisted in the server after the client run 
 coderanger oh i'm not  like i said  it's a contrived example    it came up in #5909 and seemed like an oversight to me  so figured i'd raise the issue for discussion separately  there may be cases where you've got less control of ordering  e g  i want to run a resource before a resource in a community cookbook   ah  makes sense  obvious answer is "order matters"  which is fine  but i wasn't sure if before notification was intended to be more like puppet's before ordering  in which case verifier's triggering first seems like a hindrance 
unfortunately i don't know much about the coding of chef or ruby  but you should distinguish between   variables which can only be set by chef internally or knife and   variables which are returned to chef server for display and the current_resource variable object variables like environment  role  node name  run list  basically everything i can configure in chef gui should be read only for chef client but coding errors like this one messed up our chef configuration and we rolled out a dev evironment configuration to our production environment  this was very ugly and also hard to understand and find  of course we will chef our code in future for these kind of errors  but there might be other variables that might be affected by the same problem  e g  node name  am i able to change the node name via chef client    meanwhile i couldn't clearly say no  however this is a heavy bug for me and it would be nice if one thinks about it and finds a way to fix it  thank you so much  uwe
we are looking at deploying our application website  which has several services  using chef  our services are not currently packaged  the basic pattern for each service would be  1  remote_directory to copy the files 2  template for config files 3  service  create  enable  start 
i am not explicitly setting a checksum for it  the file is initially downloaded through remote file as part of a large zip file  which i suppose could be setting it  but then chef writes over it  and fails trying to write over it the second time  so it might be holding onto a checksum from the initial download  which i assume had a fine checksum since it works the first time  but it gets confused after that

 btm i forgot to write ip in my question  following command is correct  but my issue is with chef vault not getting updated with the new node registered to chef server during knife bootstrap  to mention i am using   bootstrap vault json  "vault" "item"  in the command below to update chef vault  knife bootstrap  ip    ssh user  user    config  path to config    environment  env name    node name  node name    bootstrap vault json  "vault" "item"    sudo   run list recipe xyz  thanks
i agree to the longer fix  i'm unsure i'm able to write it that said  for the quick fix  returning cwd instead of dir pwd  i'll try to write it before leaving work now 
i upgraded chef server from chef server_11 1 3 1_amd64 to chef server co 12 0 8 1  now it's working fine  sometime i need to logout and login to see the updates 
i'm pretty sure it happens with all three   default    normal    override   i noticed it in our real code in something that was default level  for simplicity i only used  normal  in the example  here's something closer to what we actually are doing  in  chef shell   
i have tried so far on xntpd and sshd service  with the same result  i did see in the code where it calls the function that uses "lssrc  s" to check if running  and  i've confirmed that it should see both of those services as active 
 lamont granquist nope  direct connection  tried from home and work  same in both places 
 lamont granquist yes  it seems so  https   gist github com sbstnbr 078dd9c064a801472d06
 mwrock yep   wmf5 installed  that's what's weird   i have chef client running every 15 minutes  and the failures are only like once a day on some nodes  and very early  checking on the vmware side  it almost appears to correlate with high resource utilization  cpu ram    wondering if it's not getting back an answer at all on the powershell version  or timing out  or something like that  as opposed to truly not being able to find wmf5 
if there is a way for  get_priority  to use a command that does not cause side effects  i think it would be preferable  i can look into that if you deem it reasonable  regarding the apache2 cookbook  i can open an issue about that as well  regarding update rc d causing the reload in dry run mode  i'd say it could be considered a bug  what do you think  should i file an issue about that as well 
i'm not sure running it from powershell or cmd would make a difference  the issue appears to be that chef now attempts to perform an operation that requires elevated privileges  regardless of whether the user executing chef actually has them  here's a test recipe for you  execute "echo message" do command "echo 'hello world'" action  run end
 btm the user is system by default   lamont granquist this worked fine before 14 1 1  in both 14 0 202 and 13 8 5  not clear on how this works in your windows 10 test   i will do some additional testing in server 2016 to confirm 
i've been thinking about this  here are some ideas    have the option off by default  prompt the user to switch to numbers when the option is selected    use a modifier key when selecting a hint character there is a bit of awkwardness with both methods  i think both methods would benefit from a feature that is currently missing  having the hint labels update accordingly when others are filtered away  in the default scenario it's a lot nicer because i find myself doing something like this  1  narrow down to 1 4 links  2  press 1 4 on my keyboard to jump that link in the modifier key scenario it would be similar  1  narrow down to 1 4 links  2  press shift a to shift f to jump to that link using a modifier key also fixes an issue i had with vimperator  i can't narrow down links with numbers in the link text  food for thought

before the new update it all works fine  since the new update i hit the x button and nothing happens its makes me so crazy bcs it was one of the best features of vimium   i use the version 39 0 2171 95 m

when using the address bar for typing  say  a google search  any word with the vimium hot keys  f  for instance   vimium will hijack the focus and show the url jump links on the page  expected behavior  vimium should ignore any input when the address bar has focus 
welp  my computer crashed for an unknown reason and on reboot i can no longer reproduce the problem  i noticed in particular that this was happening on inputs that had js behaviors attached to them  but of course in hindsight  i just didn't encounter any non js inputs 'in the wild' on that day because this is the state of modern web applications  i had this issue with google search  with the github issue comment field i'm typing in right now  and with the comment input in jira 
thanks  mrmr1993   you are right  scrolling is working after i reset all flags 
 leoj3n i'm not using any for the trello site 
 smblott github it helps in the regular shortcuts  but not with opening links  by f or f key    if i want to open a link  i press f  then some letters  but if i on hebrew  it doesn't work  another problem is for more langs  i was lucky that hebrew exist in the list there  and i need to search for it  i think it need to be included automatically  i very like vimium  but it can be better 
after enabling and saving "ignore keyboard layout" the behavior did not change  i know because my layout is completely different  i use dvorak spanish  it is odd because even with qwerty en the letter "i" was still not working  all the others still work 
i don't  see an option  https   ptpb pw aewm7tne dobs3uk2rl5inrajmmz png  to disable smooth scrolling within vimium  if you meant within firefox  i tried that via setting  general smoothscroll  to  false  and that did not appear to solve the issue  i'm on arch linux using the latest version of firefox stable

thank you for doing the research   gdh1995  not surprised that this is due to the way this is implemented by gmail  too bad    guess i have no choice but to break my workflow and use my mouse  i'll keep bug open in case others are interested or in the event this becomes fixable down the road

sorry  did not mean you were storing passwords in plain text for one second  i have just tried it in a few more browsers and seems to be happening there too  i do not have browser auto populate on in any of the browsers i am using  update  it would seem this issue is only present if you do not have an email address on your account 
sure  i put everything i could get into the gist above  if there's a better way to capture all of the output show in the windows command prompt than   log txt  let me know 
yes that's that error  and the one you get when you clone  which seems to be related  i don't know what you mean by "saving works"  there is no "save" option  it is supposed to be saving all the time automatically  and that fails  #793   to me  if it constantly saying that my work is not being saved and i can't clone a jsbin  it's pretty much the same as being down  maybe this doesn't affect logged in users  i always use it without logging in or registering  anyway  sorry for the dup

the problem is that the jsbin console does not work  but the chrome console works jsbin console should return 1 instead it returns nothing 
i can get the code to run by hardcoding it into the console  however  if i place a block of code into the js tab  the code will not log to the console  mike raised a second ticket that seems like the same behavior i am experiencing  https   github com jsbin jsbin issues 1662
thanks   i'll do this later tonight  west coast time   appreciate it  mike
yeah  looks good  thanks so much

writing in css  nothing at all  with js  it only comments by line so to uncomment a set of lines i have to highlight all the lines together instead of leaving the cursor just somewhere inside to affect the whole block  also a little inconvenient when i have multiple sets of comments next to each other that should be separate  block comments will keep them easily distinguishable but single liners can get mixed together without extra text or whitespace

vim 7 3   set selection selection exclusive  set virtualedit virtualedit  sorry to bother you with this issue  i'm not a vim settings  programming  customize specialist  but a vim user  i inherited a  vimrc and added some easy to understand settings  so i changed the "selection" option to be excluse in vsvim  too

using vsvim 1 1 1 1 i know you fixed something in the tab  that is why i did not report it before  but when i saw that it had been "fixed" and i still had the problem  i reported it  windows 7 64bit this is vs2010 10 0 40219 1 visual assist 10 6 1859 0
i am using the vs line number margin  which appears to be the same as  set number   vs2012  c#  win7 64 basically  as soon as the cursor becomes an arrow  as opposed to the edit bar  the selection acts as i described

i am not sure  i have not been able to replicate intentionally    
i expected   cs j    and   c s j    to resolve to  control shift j   but upon further reading i found out that i had forgotten that vim doesn't make a difference between   c j   and   c s j    so if you're ok with it i'm going to close this issue 
basically i am copying from a file with a different line ending  so the paste operation  also  would you be able to intercept the normal windows clipboard paste as well to make the line ending consistent  i was thinking  a nice feature might be when it saves  it makes the line endings consistent  that might be all i really need  jim park on sep 29  2012  at 10 57 pm  jared parsons notifications github com wrote 
i tried to send an update via email but i don't see it  bottom line  you can't "move" below empty lines in visual mode

sorry  i am using chinese ime which will translate many keys to chinese characters  for example  when i type "j"  the ime will wait for me  and if then i type space  the ime will input a chinese character "就“  so i could not move the cursor down  here is a reference about the property imemode in  net

for example pressing  j  when having selected line 1 with  shift+v   i would expect to having selected lines 1 and 2  instead it exits visual mode and my cursor ends up on line 4 col 1  if i instead had pressed  k  i would have ended up on line 2 col 1  if i press either  h  or  l  i end up on line 3 col 1   when trying this out  it seems to work correctly randomly

thanks for your help  i tried to uninstall extensions for redgate and everything sees to work fine now  by the way  is there a way to list all the extensions installed  i have so many extensions installed and the interface from vs2017 is not good to get just the name of the extensions 
looks like there is a issue loading my vimrc  setting expandtab in the editor works  my vimrc is in c  users myname i tried  vimrc and  vimrcpaths but get 'parse error'  'vimrc file loading' in options is set to 'vsvimrc or vimrc files'
this is weird  on one pc that is indeed the case  after rename triggered the text is selected and vsvim is in insert mode  pressing enter at any point applies the change   but on my main dev pc the text is selected but vsvim is in normal mode and pressing enter passes through to the editor  not the inline rename symbol dialog   on this pc after  ctrl+r   ctrl+r  i have to press  c  to  c hange highlighted text then use  alt+a   the key accelerator for the  a pply button in the rename dialog   any ideas 
i'm currently developing in c++ under visual studio 2017 community edition  when i have two tabs side by side or even a top bottom split none of the ctrl+w family commands to move around work  i've recorded this behavior and uploaded it here  https   youtu be 18w8lhvfioi so i guess that left right view port support is not a possibility      at the very least  up and down movement doesn't seem possible either  edit  last line  before this one  added 
yes  those are the two options we have right now

can i compare the intervals within a single ride  i see how to compare multiple rides  an it appears i can compare specific intervals between rides  from the "rides" view  i add a histogram chart  i'd like to be able to select "intervals"  instead of "power"  "heartrate"  etc  then within the intervals histogram select a field to plot  like time  or pwr  or avg hr  then it would be interesting to compare this figure between rides 
how can i get them wrong  from the preferences pain    screen shot 2014 08 22 at 5 27 36 pm  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1110676 4017735 411ef0b6 2a43 11e4 9bf2 fb34437f4ad9 png  or  if i end up getting hr values lower than my z1  they get put into z5

related  but i am talking about merging intervals imported with a ride  paul on 2 aug 2013  at 13 20  mark liversedge notifications github com wrote 
this is screenshot of the error logs i am receiving  https   www dropbox com s dv1gljp7mzcyqs9 screenshot 202013 11 10 2017 12 05 png the percentage when the error appears is not constant  sometimes it happens after just a couple of percent  but sometimes it will go up to 70  before the error occurs  i have a lot of files in golden cheetah  i've tried removing some log files from user folder  but that didn't help anything 
that should be the problem  my windows are in czech language  a part of the gc seems to be translated  it seems that the import crashes on date settings  and those are usually based on locales  i will try to test it 
hi mark  excuse if this a repeat  for some reason i can't find the email reply i thought i'd sent  i had imported the morning's ride from a garmin 510 and then edited the summary info  i was then just looking at the ride data and possibly about to select a subset of it  regards  simon
thanks for the help  is there anything i can do to translate this as it is making my tss values  and hence everything else  be up the left  the suffering i went through for those rides compared to identical tss figure steady cruises doesn't really compare thanks for taking the time and apologies if i'm being daftchris date  wed  30 apr 2014 07 29 27  0700 from  notifications github com to  goldencheetah noreply github com cc  hutchy200 hotmail com subject  re   goldencheetah  garmin via stages to golden cheetah vast wattage discrepancy  #854  i am closing this since the issue is related to the way the head unit handles zero values when averaging  the actual data is fine  the summary metrics differ because garmin connect and the garmin head unit are using nzap and nzap to calculate np  — reply to this email directly or view it on github

here is the apple crash report   i can also send along the internal gc report if this isn't sufficient 
mark  the files did not have date   time  even though the files had no data  i added a date and the program accepted them  there were 8 other files with no data so i deleted them before importing the other 83  worked fine  is this the appropriate link to ask questions about the program as i get more into its use  thanks  bruce schwartz on sep 24  2015  at 1 56 pm  mark liversedge wrote 
sorry  unwanted

  is also assign  it's synonymous  has been for a long time apparently  i know it's a little going against the r culture  but i prefer the style and it's my chart  not gc code  anyway  acts looks like an array of date times  can't cut and paste  feature rejected       understandably though   acts 2  works  only rides without time step data fail 
hi mark  thanks for your kick response  i tried with the latest 3 or four versions  i install them when you upload the releases at github 
example  gpx is zipped and atached to starting post  dropbox share   https   www dropbox com s h9ws5kgi1nosbrl roadgrandtours_passo dello stelvio_2018 05 20_07 20 37 zip dl 0 and yes  you are right about recording interval  it is completely unclear  at least to me  why such precision is needed 
yes  sorry for the confusion  i was using both dev1802 and new one with same result  new one crashes for me though on parsing activities  i'm gonna send crashlog once i'm back home 
i'm using the latest pre release that is available  goldencheetah_v3 5 dev1903_64bit_linux appimage  i believe it was successfully connecting  i am running as root  since running as a user it would error out stating it couldn't connect  once connected i can start the training session which makes the green light on the hardware interface start blinking  which i believe means its interacting with the power brake  all stats remain at zero  but every  10 seconds  the power brake seems to go into the hardest mode  which i found to be the issue when cadence wasn't measured with tts4  is their any debug flags i can set or debugging i can try and narrow down where the issue is  thanks for the quick reply   
i presume it is something to do with the shape of the resistance block  it is just the standard fluid trainer  it was just the name of the trainer on http   www powercurvesensor com cycling trainer power curves 
i suppose this one is quite specific to our use case  i've been trying to solve this by using bytebuddy and the interface listed above  the idea is to have an instant dirty tracking object without having implement any of the setters to catch changed values 
if you mean to do this by comparing parameter types to check whether the same  method signature  https   docs oracle com javase specs jls se7 html jls 8 html#jls 8 4 2  exists  i agree that's a better idea  i think the same however can be said about   getter      setter      wither  
yes  it builds successfully with this edge release  thank you and looking forward to the next release 
as we know now a days trend is moving towards micro service architecture  troubleshooting with log file is too complex  especially in multi threaded environment  in different services  it is better to have logger to identify a transaction from end to end  with some custom context information  i found slf4j mdc serves better but it will not support multi treaded environment  below is the sample scenario where logger is required in more intelligent fashion  http   www blackpepper co uk correlating log entries using log4j and the mapped diagnostic context  hope you understand the use case 
 rspilker  indeed it's intellij  forgot to mention  i've downloaded edge release  added it as a jar dependency to all modules in my multimodule project  now the stacktrace is the following   lines are not the same so i assume this jar was used  not the previous lombok version 
if the annotation is not applicable  it is not applicable 
thanks  rzwitserloot for your fix  i can confirm you that i no longer get this error with the edge release  lombok seems to work normally in this case  i am now able to build some modules using lombok  but i cannot really test it at runtime for now because i still cannot build my whole multi module project using modules because of many other build issues 
alternatively  if it would be possible to provide an equivalent mechanism to  jacksonannotationsinside      i made a local copy of the  nonnull  annotation  and added the  annotation_type  target  the logic was not injected  so that didn't work   that could have been due to the annotation having been part of my project  albeit in the lombok namespace   though 
i cannot find in its doc  which is weird   i did get warn from console printed by latest gradle  https   discuss gradle org t regarding the annotation processors on compile classpath warning in gradle 4 6 26144
apologies for improper test case earlier  let me give you exact use case here example with jquery2 1 1 http   jsfiddle net q7gbzrbu 2  example with jquery1 5 where it works fine  http   jsfiddle net q7gbzrbu 1  yes  jquery should not suppress the error  it may be correct to not execute the pending handlers in the queue at that time  when the first handler throws error  but that should not cause a problem for newly registered handlers  in the above example ready handler is added on click of a button  it works fine on jquery 1 5 but fails with jquery 2 1 1  it looks like 1 5 uses finally block to reset "firing" flag  is it possible to have similar fix in 2 1 1   thank you for looking in to this 
2 pages  1 with 1 iframe   index html 
example here  http   jsbin com padibumefo 1 edit html console output
i will try and knock one up  quite difficult as most the contents of our site is dynamic  so i will do my best  if it helps i can tell you what was causing the issue  it appeared to be a bug somewhere in our site that was inserting an unnecessary  r n at the start of the html that we were trying to manipulate  once that  r n was removed the problem went away  so i know that the problem was within our site  but figured that the null should probably be handled by jquery as well 
say i have a collection  and it has 10 elements  based on some math the code did  it would like to apply style to very specific elements in that collection  currently  have to call eq many times to do so  but if eq accept array i can do that more easily  currently i have to use  filter    to do so

https   github com jquery jquery pull 2568 not sure if this is done correctly   if this should also go in other branches as well
in jquery  we already have these global methods  "ajaxstart"  "ajaxstop"  "ajaxcomplete"  "ajaxerror"  "ajaxsuccess"  "ajaxsend"  i suggest to add one more called "ajaxbeforecallback"  then the global methods will become  "ajaxstart"  "ajaxstop"  "ajaxcomplete"  "ajaxerror"  "ajaxbeforecallback"  "ajaxsuccess"  "ajaxsend"  then we can set the "ajaxbeforecallback" function  when jquery received the response from server  call the  ajaxbeforecallback function if exists  after that call the callback function which input by the jquery ajax function such jquery post url data callback   when there is a "ajaxbeforecallback" function  we can specify a global function to check something such as login status code before the callback function  by doing this  we do not need to add the checking code in the callback function in every jquery ajax call 
thanks for feedback  but what exactly to report to mozilla  mentioned jquery free test  https   jsfiddle net vgpavw9g   works  what are the differences between that test and what happened inside jquery  was going to investigate it later  but may be you can clarify this at once  
 dmethvin no support needed  i already found a workaround for this issue  i did post with the primary intent of reporting the issue  and the secondary intent of "by the way  if you have thoughts on a temporary fix   " the issue is that the second time around on the request  passing in the same ajax settings used from the first request  the  content type  header is being sent when it should not be 
https   jsbin com xozamo edit html js console output
yes  i'm looking forward to it 
i'm talking about the fact that console warn is used instead of bubbling the exception to the browsers exception handler which will nicely format the exception and display it with appropriate source map links  i don't know what jquery does excactly  but the "output" it produces trough its own console warn is    not foldable   not well formatted   hard to read   breaks source maps  i e  does not link to the source appropriately  jquery should not translate errors that occur and prevent the browser from displaying them  that is very  very  very bad practice and unproductive for js development 
doesn’t that mean that all pages that wait for ready will now wait a long time  and get fired before load  it makes ready almost worthless 
i tried it on testing webs  but it is impossible  its with error or work normal 
sorry i missed that note  thank you 
the first problem is that there is too much information out there  just image if you had 200+ versions of your ajax function    if you know any decent plugin please inform me  this plugin does not even parse numbers      as said  it is too much attempts out there and i belive jquery should set the standard including proper json folloewd by html post form method  shure no problem  i can even use plain old javascript for the whole process  however i dont think the majority would like to parse html forms days in and out  i mean image all people would like to manually hand craft a normal form     i mean it would be just as normal form post  but it will be translated to modern json  nothing more or nothing less  however i hope you consider this in the long term    i think it will boost jquery a lot  thank you 
why is it invalid  tbody is not required when tr comes right after table 
i'll give it a shot
no  i don't expect the  disabled  attribute to have a text  i expect the button to have a text  caption 
i'll explain  my company develop third party tool  for communication reasons  we ass iframe to the website that include our snippet  we have a client  that created a generic event handling function for analytics purpse is assume that get the text   text  of the execution context of the event  so  aslong as there are no iframe with different domain on the page   window  text   dose not throw exception  other wise it will throw  this is very undexpected from my point of view  essentially  we added an iframe  with different origin  to the page and the entire application failed 
actually  it may not be a bug     parsehtml ' h1 123  h1 '   and    parsehtml ' p 123  p '   both return a correct value  but execute to  tag     rtagname exec  elem        ""  ""      1   tolowercase     in buildfragment js ，  h1 123  h1   will return  h1   but   p 123  p   will return  null   not  p   and maybe there is a tag with only one letter which also needs a warp in future  but  rtagname  can't get it

4 3  but i'm testing only on 5 1
so  i don't need the result block to be called on main thread in my case  i do some processing on images after cache and usually put cached image on another queue just for that  but  now that i think of it  i could probably save cached image pre processed   
yes  actually it wont allow me to build without it
i'm using 3 6  maybe be it's related with nsurlcache used in restkit  but i'm not sure  as i told you in other issue https   github com rs sdwebimage issues 800 i set the images using blocks  even in uitableview  and since i'm collecting all the operations and canceling them before leave the current viewcontroller this issue seems that isn't raising any more 
thank you for you reply  bpoplauschi 1 i'm  useing  git clone https   github com rs sdwebimage git   recursive  get the last version at today  2 open sdwebimage floder select sdwebimage and vendors move to xcode of project "3rd" group 
it does work now because i am not using google maps
i started a bit of an implementation  it would certainly work  but now i'm reconsidering the  bool    approach  the only reasons that i can think of to cancel image downloads is if a network connection drops or if the user cancels it in some way  in either case  i think your current approach of nsoperations is better  and the  bool    approach doesn't really add anything  i would still definitely like to see nsprogress at some point  but i understand wanting to keep backward compatibility 
thank you  now i know the  code  dispatch_main_async_safe   code  may faster than  code  dispatch_main_sync_safe   code  am i right  and how about use operatinonqueue   code    nsoperationqueue mainqueue  addoperationwithblock         code 
actually i am not using progressview at all because option  sdwebimageprogressivedownload  makes it useless most of the time showing part the image  low decent quality or most of the image  and the progressview at a time  i am going to edit removing the noise 
i made a new project and added via cocoapods and build without any issue 
that did the trick  thanks 
sorry  i do not know sdwebimage problem  ios8 system data and presentation is normal  i look at the data in the cache simulator inside sdwebimage above  we found no repetition  but now the project which does not use any associated storage method  simply load sdwebimage big picture on the tableview  use ios9 real machine  example unable to show demo only code block
 mythodeia update the issue  but i also upload the same photo into facebook  twitter and they seems to be   correct orientated      
you are right  it turned out that there needs to be authorization  i've tried it only in my browser  which had the login credentials cached  cheers 
to reproduce this  on a table view with 230 cell  i just scroll really fast in both directions  down and top  and this eventually happens  my images are loaded from a uitableviewcell subclass  will check if there is a similar demo project  cc  guillaumelaubier
both version are used 3 7 5  and i haven't changed anything about sdwebimage

 bpoplauschi first of all  thank you for your working on sdwebimageview with flanimatedimageview  yesterday，i copyed your code sdwebimage with flanimatedimageview  into my project and the sdwebimage is the newest one  then i used your commit code to cover it  https   github com rs sdwebimage pull 1575 files   and i have a uitableview with a lot of gif  then i scrolled it fast  it crashed at sdwebimagemanager m line 61  the log shows that url is nil  then i add a safe check on url   everything goes well  so i created a pull request #1585  hope it can be merged     ### issue info   info   value                   platform name   ios     platform version   8 0     sdwebimage version   3 7 6     integration method   manually     xcode version   xcode 7 1     repro rate   all the time     repro with our demo prj   no     demo project link   null  
it s clear about image scale now  but what memory is taken for uncompressed image pixel  isn't it 32 bit rgba  so each pixel take 4 bytes  so i can set totalcost    maxmemory     4 bytes per pixel    100    1024    1024   4   26214400  
 mythodeia yeah   i have tested another demo with real it don't work also and have the same error  i use the real test 
i've checked the url mentioned is working  could you test with this one  http   api limologs com v1 limo vehicle_diagram cls_id 3
picture in the news list   seems to have no relationship with url   2 7 6 the following has never happened  
not tested with demo project  just tested with new clean project and random image url from web  same results  everything works fine in ios8 and ios9  in ios10 image not set  at least does not shows up in imageview  p s  getting same results with uikit+afnetworking setimagewithurl
yes i m using the latest version of sdwebimage  sorry can't make a demo at the moment  my scenario is that i m loading feeds in tableview  a cell has a collectionview and has 4 images in horizontal scroll 
 mythodeia i want to say means the method  will be cached  and now the latest version of the method is not cached  as if it is real time download
 mythodeia all image like    there are about 100 pictures  the problem is the same picture if replaced by jgp format there is no such problem this question bothered me for a long time and i am eager to get your help！ thx！
no i didn't solve yet  i found on latest version on tue  may 9  2017 at 7 24 am  flyingchickenwings  notifications github com
the file size is 892k   i promise you will find this issue  when you build a project loading gif with xcode 7 3 and run it on the platform whose version is ios 10 3   i think it's a bug from apple   but i cant resolve it
i don't think that can solve it  cause for one image  sdwebimagemanager's singleton would just cache it once in one place  while i do want to cache all transformed image of that image to disk  and use it in its right place  maybe the core issue is that i want the sd do the most things for me  like download which is ok to use the shared instance   cache which is not ok for this case to use the shared cache instance   find cache     and then i would just use the api on sdwebimagemanager's to load image 
sorry i have no heic format image url  because the current social software does not support the format  but you can use iphone 7 + ios11 shooting "live" format picture  that is heic format
i resolved my problem。before the completionblock callback  application has thrown an exception because of not set a root view controller at the end of application launch 
 dreampiggy i'm trying to only cache image data with  storeimagedata   for now i'm using  store uiimage    imagedata  forkey    todisk   completion  nil   with a dummy  uiimage  
here's a test repo link  https   github com ericeddy flanimatedimage rotationissue i've noticed that using just any jpg doesn't cause it  like random jpgs from the internet cause it to occur sporadically  but using images taken with the phone's camera will cause it 100  of the time  and using a landscape photo vs using a portrait photo will add an extra 90 degrees to the rotation
 mythodeia thank you for your reply i have completed the issues info and provide the sample url i had an urge to solve the problem，thanks 
thank you  dreampiggy i filled the template i didn't set any configuration  i'm use default  uiimageview  sample code 
thank you   i i have solved the problem。because the resolution of the picture is relatively large。 but it is strange that other systems don't have this problem such as ios12 2  ios11 0  platform ios 10 3 3 ，sdwebimage version：5 0 0，integration method：manually，xcode version：10 2  uiimageview  webcache     void sd_setimagewithurl  nullable nsurl   url placeholderimage  nullable uiimage   placeholder  when load a large image  the memory will surge 
hi  thanks for your quick answer  the problem was confirmed on hfs+ devices  several cases reported by users  all kind off os versions   but don't assume it wasn't also on ios 10 devices  i've made some tests on simulator  device  playground  also mac os and it seems that this property isn't set by os automatically  my concern is that the documentation state that this property was readonly prior ios 11  so i don't know if we can handle it on such devices i've checked your methods  and atime seems the way to go http   kerolasa github io filetimes html  but need a test to validate it on real devices  and i've only ios13+ device for now
it appears lein cljsbuild uses eval in project
i had the problem on previous versions but i need to test again with this version  since  main is also used to specify the main class for the jar  which should skip aot apply in this case  is there a use case of wanting to create a jar without its main class being compiled when making uberjar

  system exit 0   doesn't work any better  unfortunately  ctrl+c doesn't actually do anything  it looks essentially like a  noop     system exit 0   throws an ugly set of exceptions but never actually exits  it ends up being a hung java process that i have to kill manually by using some  ps   grep java  that i use from mingw  or open up task manager and find the rogue  java  task not exiting 
i probably do  my apologies  i've been updating the  set lein_version      in the  lein bat   but not re downloading the script

i figured it was  i've got project specific tasks defined in  src leiningen   on a related note  i've got a more minimal example of the problem  1   start a new project with  lein new tproj   2   modify  project clj  so it looks like this   taking out   eval in leiningen  makes things behave again  also  taking out   aot  and   main  allows compilation and testing  if one isn't supposed to use  eval in leiningen  to create project specific tasks  i'll volunteer to add a comment on some stack overflow responses    thanks for all your hard work on this  by the way  it's a really nice thing 
 lein compile  always exits with status code 0  if you add    require cemerick piggieback   to the core clj ns declaration the result is the same  files are missing from compilation  i only tried it with piggieback  also i filed an issue for piggieback   https   github com cemerick piggieback issues 6   and cemerick replied the   injections  clause is obsolete  so i really don't need it  but besides that  he thinks this is a lein issue

thanks  changing   base  to something else did indeed make checkouts work again  i can probably use the   dev  profile for what i want  regarding the namespace  that would probably make me and others less likely to do stuff like this  so that sounds like an improvement  thanks again for the quick and helpful response

bigger issues with that one     maybe i'm not running it correctly   bin lein search foo  after  cd leiningen core    lein do clean  install   
2 4 0 was installed via homebrew  i uninstalled the homebrew version and used the instructions in readme to install 2 4 2  https   github com technomancy leiningen#installation   both 2 4 0 and 2 4 2 gave me this error  2 3 4 works  rolled back via  lein upgrade 2 3 4  
it does appear to be lein ring specific  doing  lein uberjar  with a   main  works fine 
no  unfortunately surrounding with both kind of quotes doesn't work as well as escaping with a backquote  result is the same as using powershell's

steps to reproduce 
as i understand now lein handles  dev resources  for compatibility with old versions  right  is it possible to do that only for   min lein version  less than 2 5 3 for example  that would be compatible with old setup 
hi  hypirion  no  same behavior  by the way  what    leaky  is supposed to do 
yes  i tried to build leiningen from git head  i want to know how leiningen is developed  to be exactly  the workflow leiningen dev team used
not really  i've just re install my laptop  i've the latest ubuntu with all packages updated     and i still have this error
the distro is fully updated as far as i know  so can't simply update nss  already fully reinstall openjdk 8 to oracle java8 to no effect  this has been going on for weeks  but i took a break from trying to fix it  what are some dependencies i should check or reinstall and what could be a possible culprit  this whole issue is very perplexing since i have basically not done any work with clojure as of yet  it might be important to add that i have installed an intellij plugin cursive for clojure development  but have not done anything other than get lost  possibly due to it not working because leiningen isn't working  please help with anything  really want to get this sorted out 
 https   github com technomancy    whatever you say  i'm just a beginner   https   github com danielcompton making leiningen detect  and warn  if there are clojure complete and tool nrepl dependencies in the  repl profile which request a version of software  clojure itself in this case  that can't be loaded  the user might try to request clojure "1 8 0 alpha3" by using the above line in "   lein profiles clj" file  because he wants  for some reason  to issue the command " lein repl " _outside of_ a project directory and get clojure "1 8 0 alpha3"  not the version hard coded into his leiningen software  which is what he will unknowingly wind up with  
it seems to be working now  the lein script from https   leiningen org  now links to https   raw githubusercontent com technomancy leiningen stable bin lein the other broken link comes from the lein script from the master branch 
lein version  can't attach the  project clj   but it's contents are as follows   defproject clojure newb "0 1 0 snapshot"  description "fixme  write description"  url "http   example com fixme"  license   name "epl 2 0 or gpl 2 0 or later with classpath exception 2 0"  url "https   www eclipse org legal epl 2 0 "   dependencies   org clojure clojure "1 9 0"    main   skip aot clojure newb core  target path "target  s"  profiles   uberjar   aot  all   
i'm running in a completely fresh account in vagrant     it's possible the problem is somehow coming from inside the nrepl server i'm connecting to  it's just strange that it would appear on leiningen 2 9 1 but not on 2 8 1 which i was running previously 
i think k 1 for dirichlet values and categorical multinomial probabilities make sense  as it removes the potential for error when specifying vectors that must sum exactly to one 
there was no issue 
i like that idea  its analogous to what matplotlib's  savefig  does for saving figures  inferring the type from the filename 
i don't know  as this is a new model  but it seems unlikely since transformations have always been renamed to something  i will try it though

actually  the lazy evaluation stuff is in play here  an instance of lazyfunction is created in the stochastic   init   method and the force_compute   method is called there  too  the happens both for the main binomial log likelihood function as well as the partial gradient functions  and it seems the lazy evaluation stuff is somehow potentially the culprit  i've been trying to track this down  but so far the closest i can get is that removing a few lines of code seems to have no adverse effect on the way i'm calling pymc and the segfault and core dumps i'm seeing are gone   obviously  this isn't solving the problem  and weirdly it suggests that a single lazyfunction instance is ok  the problems only start when more than one are instantiated  anyhow  this is on python 2 7 as shipped by ubuntu 12 04 amd64 
i just did a few different samples   then tried  pymc matplot summary_plot mc  
aha  thanks for the pointer  it seemed that something went wrong with uninstalling the former before installing the latter  so i uninstalled both versions  carefully removing any trace in the site packages folder  and then reinstalled pymc 2 2  the version provided by canopy   now it works 
cannot replicate error in current version  v2 3 4   works fine  apologies for the trouble  thought i was up to date 
sorry  i couldn't replicate the issue with a simple example  going back and forth between my real and example scripts  the issue seemed to be be related to scope  in my script  which had the issue    pm sample  was called in a function within a function the issue was probably related to my poor coding than pymc 
i haven't found a way to define a densitydist such that it'll be a joint distribution of more than one variable  if that is possible  it would be great  but all the examples i've seen that use densitydist are for a single input  how do i make pymc3 recognise that i'm defining densitydest over both x and y  if i use density dist to refer to the f2 x y   function  e g  with model  section instead has   apologies  i should have posted all the things i had tried previously  the issue is that i don't know how to get pymc3  using densitydist or otherwise  to work when the logprobability is a function of two  or more  variables  i e  in a more complicated case we're unsure how to separate the two variables  but know how to define their joint pdf  and we want to be performing inference on the values of those two variables  is there some way to tell densitydist that the input size is 2  or more  
it complained about a dimensionality mismatch  i had to change the shape of  sigma_alpha  to   n_country 1  1   for it to work  this to me suggests that the gaussianrandomwalk is connected via the countries  which is not what i intended  i did get it to compile and run after i did  note all the transposes  t  and shape of alpha      however    it seems that the posterior on sigma_beta is constant regardless of the country which suggests that there is some funny business going on here  in conclusion it seems that the concatenate option is the safest option 
i profiled the  find_map  function  memory seems to spike  here  https   github com pymc devs pymc3 blob 13496d623b510460b04c15484e398d4290566cfc pymc3 tuning starting py#l70  and  here  https   github com pymc devs pymc3 blob 13496d623b510460b04c15484e398d4290566cfc pymc3 tuning starting py#l94   although if i understand correctly  no actual computation is happening there  it's just preparing a theano graph    also  tried to reproduce outside pymc with the following snippet   but the memory usages remains under 200 mb 
that's a possibility  the only thing that makes me uncomfortable defining a new  mvnormalneighbor  or whatever is that this approximation is only interesting for gp  only in gps  where the covariance matrix is obtained through a covariance function  you can define what is a neighbor or not  then  it makes sense to keep this isolated on the gp class  however  the nngp approximation directly approximate the inverse of the covariance matrix and its determinant  so the current implementation in terms of  mvnormal  is not appropriate for this approximation  a possibility would be to add in  mvnormal the possibility of passing the inverse of the covariance matrix  this can be an extra option  that adds to the current ones  covariance and also cholesky decomposition of the covariance   does this make sense 
i tried deleting   theano   and various other means of blowing in the cartridge  restarting my computer  reinstalling  pmyc3   and am still getting  1 0   what's more  a colleague sitting next to me is getting the same result  we're working from a virtualenv   here are the versions of possibly relevant packages

hi twiecki  thanks for the reply  by programming guide i mean some kind of code annotation  for example  when i tried to read metropolis py  i met  class metropolis arraystepshared    so i had to check arraystep py  where i found  arraystepshared  is a faster version of  arraystep   then i went to  class arraystep blockedstep    then i found it difficult to understand  class blockedstep   however in slicer py i found  class slice arraystep   instead of  class slice arraystepshared    so the way for new members to take part in the development is to read through all the relevant code to get started  regards  yan

cool  now it works  why is the dirichlet distribution not calling shape on a  wouldn't this be a more straightforward way of handling multi dimensional parameters  the normal distribution does not require a shape argument  thanks for your help helmut
 junpenglao i don't know how to compute the rmse from loo       btw i moved the discussion  thanks
hi guys  thanks for the responses  although  a simple linear regression fit with metropolis doesn't give this error  i have reproduced it with a simple test case for the kind of model i am fitting  i am using the latest pymc3 version from master  and here's the versions again 
works if i replace  d_t        with  d_t  pymc3 poisson dist mu 12    same with d_s   i don't know why this is different though 
i don't have any  theanorc config file  but when reinstalling theano  the problem disappeared  it now works 
 observed  is the same for both models  shape and data   junpenglao  what is the best way to provide an example if i have a csv with data  in another repository 
ok  thanks   
well  that would only allow a single order of magnitude increase in number of iterates  at the cost of using 1 tb of harddrive space and reducing performance   is there any reason that all iterates need to be stored  perhaps i can make a pr with a backend that does not store the results

hi  colcarroll i think at least for the short mid term it'd be great to have pymc3 traceplots by default behave in the old way  making the new behavior optional and configurable also sound like good ideas to me  for context  i often have traceplots for 20 30 valued parameters that work fine on the same axis that would all essentially fail using the new behavior and really couldn't be plotted anymore  i get that there might not be huge value in plotting 30 beta distributions on one plot  but it does give you a quick picture of how well your trace turned out  thx 
can't seem to find the reason  although i'm not testing too many cases because i don't want to do this on a live project   will let you know if this comes up again

yes  that looks right now  thanks 
yes  apologies for the delay scott  i just assigned you  charlie  the changes they're making will open up the default geoprivacy for many taxa  so i'd check once this is finished and then if you still have questions email me and i can connect you with the natureserve canada folks 
ok  great  as far as an interim design solution it's ready to go  i will whip up some specs early this week  one thing this mock up doesn't reflect is a matching height between the profile pics and the taxon pics in the "most observations  most species   " lists  this way the "view all" links will line up properly

my apologies i can't reproduce this bug now  consarnit  i only reported it because i thought we didn't have that functionality  one thing i am noticing though    if you drag 100+ obs onto add obs  immediately go to another tab and try to close add obs  you won't get the alert  however  i think that's an edge case  works for me on chrome version 57 0 2987 133  64 bit   ff 42 0 and safari version 10 1  12603 1 30 0 34  i'm on mac sierra 10 12 4  if you're not finding anything wrong  i guess we can close this issue 
looking good on brave 
yup  looking good  thanks

i am setting 6 7  days old roast commit to match with the fact that release branch is a bit behind  https   github com perl6 roast commit b425a4b31fb36b91bbac15e5d63b992f6acf5bc1 a newer one https   github com perl6 roast commit db3fec5c30486adf9ad1f70422daabf1d1b217a0 doesn't pass test on this rakudo branch 
the leak may have slowed  but has not been eliminated 
yes  i installed strawberry perl for the express purpose of installing perl6 modules 
i'm currently working on an implementation of cldr   icu stuff  and the rounding is specified as being the default for binary floats  this is also the default rounding method for java  python  haskell  among others  since it's the default under ieee 754  for any implementations or ports  there's likely going to be an unstated assumption that the rounding mode is this way and to maintain equivalent results between languages there should be an easy way to maintain similar math results   i only noticed it because the unicode's tr35 specifically mentioned that half even rounding was the expected default  and upon testing realized that — even when using num or native floats rounding is always up  for most applications  not doing it won't cause a problem and of course a separate module can be written  and i'll probably do that in the meantime   but it seems like it'd be better handled at the core level — and it was suggested by tony o on #perl6 to open a ticket for it 
looks good   
thanks  i installed the 2019 07 1 version  https   github com rakudo rakudo releases  by  perl configure pl   gen moar   make install   prefix   rakudo could you please elaborate on "if from a package then most likely you need to look for zef package too " 
this appears to be fixed in the latest version  this is rakudo version 2019 07 1 454 g7e7aa2626 built on moarvm version 2019 07 1 316 g23daabadc implementing perl 6 d  i can try to make a test case when i get a chance 
yep  it works under rc 1  this is rakudo version 2019 11 built on moarvm version 2019 11 implementing perl 6 d  thanks 
no  because we got warning in this case also   value  can be an object with public properties and witout  __tostring  method
sure   note  as i type this i realize this may be a long winded answer  i apologize ahead of time  i still think the idea has merit      summary of what yaml frontmatter is  http   wiki github com mojombo jekyll yaml front matter  from the jekyll project ## rapid development i see twig as a huge step in outsourcing the process of template development to a front end team that has html  css and js expertise but may not be as comfortable with php  this could also include services like psd2html and xhtmlized  ### the app in a typical template dev scenario a person or team is given design mockups and then it is their responsibility to turn those mockups into web pages  in this scenario a php team could set up a _sandboxed environment_ that functions as a template development app  inside this app is where the template folks would build the html using twig  ### fixtures that's fine  but what if the site is very data driven  it would be great to have the template dev team take care of building the "for" loops  et cetera that loop through and display the data  but they can't do that if there's no fake data  think fixtures  for them work with  you don't really need a full fledged sql database to handle this task  yaml is a very good option  in this scenario a list of yaml fixtures could be kept in separate files and put into the context as data when the template was rendered  as long as they were told how the data was structured and where they could get it  the template dev team could build twig templates that could be hooked up to a real sql database later on without much fuss  ### more flexibility for very agile teams this is not enough  for most sites driven by a content management system  there is a set data structure  say  in mysql  addressed above  but the system is expected to be flexible enough to handle arbitrary data on a per template  or per page  basis  we see this implemented in a lot of systems like this  "custom fields" in wordpress is a good example  it is typical in a lot of small companies that the web designer becomes the template developer as well  it is also typical that these folks do not have extensive sql experience  and they shouldn't have to    their job is information design  as a part of the creative process  why not let the designer create and develop new elements on the fly  your designer is familiar with yaml from examining the yaml fixtures you created earlier    and let's face it  yaml is easy to figure out  ## example let's say that on the "home" template on the site  it is now desirable to have a slideshow that has five large images  each with a caption and short description  using twig and yaml frontmatter the designer could define the data structure and start building the functionality immediately  using a template similar to this  home html    with the right images and css in place  the prototype is done  and the designer didn't have to know anything about sql tables  migrations or anything else  the advantage is agile and rapid development  with yaml frontmatter the prototype is built    now there can be a discussion on how to make this prototype a real feature by porting to a sql or nosql database or whatever  hope that explanation helps 
to be honest i've never tried to run the twig test suite   can you provide me a quick how to 
fabpot twig v1 3 0 84 g6849705 zip the error persists  loop index gets 1  1  1  1    
missing a filter to apply to array for present data very simply with a separator  for example     php  users   array "john" "mac" "fabien"      and i would like to have in output   john  mac  fabien
 heahdude   i really do mean "blocks"  as defined by the  block  http   twig sensiolabs org doc tags block html    here  https   github com sonata project dev kit issues 205  is the related issue that show why i need that   we have a bundle with a block named  example   and it has been decided that blocks should be namespaced so that there is no risk of collision when inheriting from our templates  that means i would like to deprecate the  example  block in favor of a  sonata_randombundle_example  block   fabpot   big difference indeed  i get it now  i'm closing this then 
oh  i see  i was not aware of a  block   function   it might be useful if that was mentioned in either the  block tag  https   twig symfony com doc 2 x tags block html  or  extends tag  https   twig symfony com doc 2 x tags extends html  documentation  for those unaware  thanks for the tip 
list html twig  div class "newslist"     for c in lister getcontentlist 30 true 36 true        right     endfor          div       div class "newslist"     for c in lister getcontentlist limit 30 order true nodes 36 includechildnodes true        error     endfor          div      builder php      twig  addglobal 'lister'  new module lister  this  em   this  site        lister php class lister   public function __construct  em   site     this  em    em   this  site    site        public function getcontentlist  limit   25   order   true   nodes   null   includechildnodes   true   position   null   tags   null   indays   null   betdate   null           
there we go so  normally all the projects that i'm involved i have a lot of javascript  and js comments  inserted in to the twig layouts  _also  normally i'm calling a block which is in the top of the page  i don't like to put js code in the middle of the page _ the thing is that i would like to parse all this js code to remove the comments  i don't want to show the comments to the user    for example     what i was using temporally were twig comments  # #   but then they could break my code because they are removing the  n line  that's why my last issue   i wanted to check the template engines for python or ror to find a example  i'm sure that they have this feature implemented  unfortunately  i don't have enough time  cheers 
there are different objects e g  col  renderer  so for different type of column different renderers should be applied  i don't want to hardcode if else conditions in one custom filter  there can be any number of objects and any number of renderers

 refx mike looks like to me that twig is replacing   rdquo   with   amp rdquo  
ok
sure  i am testing in       1 23 1  but this problem has existed for at least a year  ## index php  as you schoid be able to see the error is reported as being in index html twig rather than in content html twig  the diff i supplied above resolves the issue 
in fosuserbundle in resources views layout html twig there is just the full html like  and then in my symfony installation in app resources i create a fosuserbundle views layout html twig with one only line     extends 'fosuserbundle  layout html twig'     that should work right 
i had no custom error handlers except  this one from elaoerrornotifierbundle  https   github com elao errornotifierbundle blob master listener notifier php#l192 
actually the goal of the reproducer was to show the difference of behavior between 1 24 and 1 25 but it's not interesting actually  the issue is that if you use a relative path      my dir   per example   in 1 25  findtemplate 'test'   will return something like  my dir test  while it should return     my dir test   another related issue is that the is_file   check is done with   path ' '  shortname      my dir test in my example   it means that the is_file check will pass but the path returned by the find_template function does not lead to any file and the caller  getsouce  will raise a warning when trying to get the file content 
we do have preprocessors for themeable objects  for which we historically use so called render arrays  e g  you might have one that looks like   i have all of that working  and as its render array specific  it is only for drupal 8 anyway  but i need the check moved from the lexer to the compile time or construction time of the twig_node_body  as you can see i just return the source code of the inner template from the block instead of the compiled version  which is then run via loadtemplate   again  etc 
mmmh not exactly  i have 3 "applications"  webapp  admin  api    which sends emails  located in the same place on the same server  each one having a specific vhost  but sharing the same common code  models  libs      including the twig management class   the twig management class uses the twig_loader_filesystem to provide twig with places to search for templates  here is the ctor code  if it can help understand better how the application is architectured   as i said  i could rename  for example  admin view _layout twig in admin view _layout_admin twig in order to have unique filenames  but then i'd have to change every place where this file is extended  no big deal  of course  but i'd have preferred not to have to do it  and to have an option to use the old algorithm instead  which takes subfolder into account for computing the cache file name key   best regards 
 fabpot will do a few more tests my end  as just entering a integer it works fine but when being passed from my object it fails 
my goal is to have a function to "prepare" data and to call one or multiple block for display this data  imagine you make a library to manage form  with the twig integration of your library  you can make several blocks  one for the form  one by elements  one for error messages        but your blocks will become very complicated  for example  the form block need to check all elements and call other block   if you have a function to do the complicated routing to blocks and to prepare data for displaying  you can have juste very simple block and it's easy for the users of your package to personalize the output    sorry for my english 
not off the top of my head  but i know i've come across several times that i just want to insert functionality either before or after a tag is parsed  and extending as an aliased tag then calling parent  parse   would have made it really easy  that's a simple use case but there have been more complicated cases involving more advanced embed like functionality and such  however  ins't the question backwards  shouldn't the question be "why _shouldn't_ we allow anyone to ever extend this class " moreover  "what risk does my library assume if someone extends this class " rather than "i can't think of a reason to extend this class  so no one should " especially if it's something that isn't part of the core functionality  and is rather an extension itself from core  e g   if no one had thought to create the "embed" token  would you have marked the "include" token as final  thereby forcing embed out of existence 
ah yip  that fixes it  apologies  i should've searched through the closed issues 
yes i noted that    regading use case  i was thinking in something like this in templates   each of those tag could have some logic behing to use with attributes given or just print atributes as per se  a template will be used also for rendering such "component"  this is why i though on having  twig_lexer  and  twig_parser  extended and also adding later  twig_node  as needed  it did look more natural to me to have it available for configuration later on on twig and take advantage of twig api for it  about your suggestion on using pre processor  i havent read about it  yet  unfortunately  so i can not tell how far can i get with it  could you please provide me some resources to chew 
does twigfiddle also compile the code before execution in exactly the same way as symfony does  i can't reproduce the error on twigfiddle  even though i make the code an exact match of what i use in symfony  as you'll notice from the original post  the error occurs in the compiled code in the  var cache dev folder of symfony 
we are not looking extend it  we want to use twig source instead of twig_source  we in particular don't like the "_" on the class name 
it is because i just want the url to look "better" rather than odd to users  nothing special  for example mozilla firefox doesn't mind keeping     and     signs rather than encoding them if you just manualy type the url

yup  that would be it  might be a good idea to stick a mention in the readme  i see it on the wiki now  
i think for any object that cannot be sorted by a specific sorting option or does not have that info then it should be listed at the end of the list similar to how finder does it  also would be nice to have the sort order reversed if you choose to sort by the sort option that is currently selected  ie "sort by name" sorts list ascending to begin with  choosing "sort by name" again would sort by name desc  etc   
 philostein i guess what i meant by urls was more for web search urls  google  amazon  etc    so that hitting spacebar would jump to the third pane to enter in the search criteria  not sure if qs distinguishes between urls   search urls   pjrobertson that looks awesome and i think the priority looks right on  i imagine it would cover 95  of daily use cases  any eta on a release date  i would love to start using this ☺

it appears to happen with any uninstalled plugin  as far as trying to delete uninstalled plugins goes  that was a misunderstanding on my part  for some reason  i was thinking that “uninstalled” meant “previously installed  but now disabled”  after your question  i thought about it and realized that didn’t make sense  doing what i intended to do — delete plugins that were _disabled_ — works fine

sorry  i don't understand… i thought there was only 1 interface to quicksilver and to mountain lion   anyway  what i am using is where i press ctrl space and this overlay appears on the center of the screen  with a magnifying glass on the left  and the text "type to search" 
thanks for the breakdown and suggestions  it has led me to progress and now i can reproduce the problem so hopefully others can likewise to look into it further  and i have worked around it for now  to reproduce the problem  uninstall current install  reinstall but without selecting any plugins to start  now  select a bash script  tab to actions and select "run      "  tab again  and you should see it go back to the selected bash script  let us know if somebody can reproduce this

thanks for the quick response  it's not related to any specific query  every quicksilver activation causes a crash  whether i search for anything or not    in fact  it's impossible to keep it running long enough to deactivate spotlight    actually  it's impossible to keep it running  period  if i launch it and wait a few seconds  it crashes  i'm very sorry i'm unable to give you more useful information than that    is there a way to disable spotlight in quicksilver without launching quicksilver  i'm happy to edit a  plist file or run a "defaults write" command  whatever it takes  i know my way around the console  and i'm unafraid of diving in    i was persistent  i managed to move fast enough to go to catalog   custom   spotlight and disable it  and now i am able to use quicksilver again  spoke too soon  it crashed again  but i was able to keep it alive long enough to find and disable plugins   spotlight   smart folders and plugins   spotlight   comment tags  it's been alive for 5 minutes or so now  and i'll await further instructions  thanks again

i use  always used  the bezel  built in   i'm not sure i understand what you mean with what's selected  i think it always has the last thing that i called  or the parent folder  when file is deleted   if you mean what am i invoking when it fails  generally it is a script  but i think it is 1  what i call the most and 2  because in these scripts having or not having the first letter is critical to what is invoked  to clarify  script is "new safari"  so invoked by 'nsa' vs 'sa' that calls regular safari instead  so i definitely realise it's not what i wanted   whereas 'saf' and 'af' both invoke safari 
did you read it  usecase  http   kreitz co c8691223b2e8f0903301 issue  http   kreitz co 38164158c0e6060f086d if it used the first url  or detected with one was from github   this wouldn't be happening 
 sirkitree thanks for confirming this point  i did not update the issue because right after opening it i found my hub version was updated  and i thought it might have been solved    i'll take a look at the issue again this week   mislav  i'm sorry  i'm really busy right now  exams at university 
whatever seems cleanest to you  i would just remove it personally  but i don't know how long its been deprecated  and no worries  it made a pr against my fork  for some reason  it's not doing prs against origin master correctly any more  i guess that's a separate issue

hub version 
ah  good catch  i didn't realize that the problem was one level deeper  perhaps one could make  hub clone  owner   repo   output something like  finding ' owner   repo ' on github com      as that would make it possible to catch gotchas like this one by elimination  if hub _doesn't_ output a  finding     on github com     line  because   owner   repo   matches an existing directory   then any error about a repository not existing must have come from git itself  it would also not break many scripts  as one can easily  grep  v  away this line and end up with plain git output  just my € 0 02    
i didn't update and it started asking for 2 factor authentication today  i wonder if there was an api outage or something similar  either way  thanks for the quick response  mislav  looks like it's working now 
yes  i did chase it down some more and the problem i think is a design issue  it appears that the hub command wants to pre process all input using a simple shell like parser  i think for real  nix environments  this works  however  in a windows world  strings in various cmds  environment variables  and gitconfig files will likely need to be in dos syntax  backslashes and spaces need to be treated differently     sometimes  i say sometimes as folks will be using various windows based shell environments like cygwin or msys git  they may format their env vars with either native dos syntax or with  ba sh  and this doesn't begin to touch on powershell users     and just to make it more interesting  some of those shells may re interpret shell syntax to dos or native on assignment  before just trying to hack at this  i would be interested in others opinions on what the right solution might be  if it wasn't such a big hammer  i would just consider eval'ing the string using the designated shell  maybe specified by 'hub shell' and or some known  hubshell  shell vars and get out of the parsing business all together  a child process could be spun off and fed input to reduce the overhead of several eval's per hub invocation  we also run into the problem that in windows shells like msys git  "vim" which is the default editor  is a msys git shell script  not an exe  when hub tries to exec this  it fails  the exec   processing would need to honor the shell of choice as well    
that would be great 
just tried again  same symptoms 
temporarily renaming     config hub  results in another     config hub  being created with identical contents as soon as i perform any hub command  is there a backup config file or something i should be aware of 
git version 2 6 2 hub version 2 2 1 i have no idea why the origin remote exists  but i can confirm this 
looks like 4 3 7ubuntu1 5 per http   packages ubuntu com trusty updates shells bash  that computer is at the office so i can't check in person at the moment but this should be accurate 
still reproduces with hub 2 2 2  i haven't tried building hub from source  the output shown above is exactly what i see  except for some colorization of the verbose output 
if you want the default behavior of  hub browse  to stay unchanged  we could provide switches like   p  for opening up the linked pull request    b  for the branch etc 
when running hub fork when you have a existing forked branch on github  hub just overwrites the github branch  therefore removing any pushed commits 
i guess it depends on what  owner name  translates to  i'm just wondering how that translates to ghe in my case specifically where  project repo  might mean one thing on github com  but something else on ghe

i don t think so  my fork is here   https   github com tiiiecherle homebrew cask blob master casks eaglefiler rb  https   github com tiiiecherle homebrew cask blob master casks eaglefiler rb  and it is still showing the old data and old version number  should show  afterwards 
i see  if the purpose of opening the page is to create a pull request  both will do the trick  but for navigation  i can go easily from forked page to upstream page  but not vice versa  what do you think 
i ended up fixing this but i'm not 100  sure how  i think it was because i had two hosts in my config and one of them was wrong     thanks anyway 
they should be  but they weren't  i'm not entirely sure how to give an example  given that  stash 's output doesn't change by flags  but you should be able to replicate it pretty easily  make changes to two files  add one  and use    keep index   if it works  the added changes should be left intact  but in my experience they weren't 
 mislav thanks for your answer  1  correct 2  i actually don't see this as a bug  i have 2 remotes   origin  points to my fork and  upstream  points to the canonical repository  it would be enough if  hub  takes me to the upstream repo when i explicitly specify it 
i set it in my profile  and i verify it from the cli by running  echo  github_host  
yes  it happens every time  i just set up hub on a new computer   it also happens if i try to use password authentication 
 mislav thanks for the quick response  1  i'm using ver 2 5 0 2  i do have write access  i was able to push after manually changing the remote url to https  btw  this is the error i received   3  thanks for pointing to that part of the documentation  for the future  shouldn't push urls be https by default  because the git protocol isn't supported on push by github  
 mislav i didn't compile it myself  just using the precompiled version 2 5 1 for linux arm 32 bit from the releases page  maybe it's a problem in some networking dependency upstream 
hi  mislav 😄 1  my hub version is  2 7 0   i ran  brew upgrade hub  before trying this out 2  git var git_editor is  vim  right now 3  it's been happening every time so far  but i've only been making prs into private repositories
i am sorry beforehand  i forgot which pr is that commit sha from  let's just say we take the example of  this pr  https   github com github hub pull 2298   the  latest commit  https   github com github hub pull 2298 commits d7de991be83337de2d5b8dce29c6cd7b6f0a8bd5  has the long sha of  d7de991be83337de2d5b8dce29c6cd7b6f0a8bd5  and the short 7 digit sha of  d7de991   i attached the screenshot below that the  hub ci status  command works with the long version of the sha but not with the short version of the sha  is this the expected behavior  thank you very much   slightly_smiling_face    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 7043511 66476550 15b03280 eac0 11e9 921d edcf3a03854d png 
overriding repo for any command would be ideal  yes  thank you 
thanks   mislav  downloading a precompiled binary from the releases pages fixes it 
hey   could you post some example of it with highcharts in node js 
i send the image base64 code on monday but  on safari  ie and android navigator  the pdf generation does not works  i have no download and error on the typedarrays  they are undefined in core navigator javascript engine 
any update on this  i can share code soon if required 
no       now  i have the visibility hidden but i have a scrollbar  i didn't find a solution for this   
 simonbengtsson got code from http   rawgit com mrrio jspdf master     'body'  is part of jquery if i do not add jquery   it fails and shows errors of some compressed code 
 arasabbasi no ，it don't run download ，and my browser run very slow
here is a screenshot of the problem  please let me know if it doesn't work on your computer  i'll check to see if heroku has cdn servers in europe    screen shot 2017 05 25 at 8 33 38 am  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16582136 26454814 651d0984 4125 11e7 9145 4a5cc03a0588 png

thanks for the prompt reply  i'm attaching a test case zip file including the original font i used to encode to base64  i can also send you more fonts to try but it's the same with every font i tried   no greek characters are displayed   greekcharacters zip  https   github com mrrio jspdf files 2703297 greekcharacters zip  any insight on what might be causing this issue would be greatly appreciated 
 arasabbasi thanks for feedback on the idea  right now i don't have plans or a roadmap to implement this  it just would have been useful to have if it would have been there  which i wanted to document   personally i had to go with different fonts for the very project i'm working on  
changing the unit to  pt  doesn't help unfortunately  the  width  option for html2canvas has no effect 
the  pre  code gm_registermenucommand commandname  commandfunc  accelkey  accelmodifiers  accesskey     pre   code function that is available from a userscript is defined in  components greasemonkey js  this function's inputs have not changed  but are feed into  pre  code this browserwindows i  registermenucommand command     code   pre  which is defined in  idl gmibrowserwindow idl as  pre  code void registermenucommand in gmimenucommand menucommand    code   pre  gmimenucommand is defined in  idl gmimenucommand idl  and the docommand method is defined as   pre  code void docommand     code   pre  without inputs  which means that no argument will be passed to commandfunc  even if a userscripts provides gm_registermenucommand      with a function that accepts an argument  another way to put this is that in  content browser js  pre  code gm_browserui registermenucommand   function menucommand        code   pre  the menucommand docommand does not accept an input string  and this is a shared issue with the the rest of the references made to it  so my thought was to add the following to the menucommand idl  pre  code void docommandwithstring  in astring inputstr     code   pre  which would be available in chrome for other firefox addons  namely for a greasemonkey ubiquity command i've worked on  http   r evold ca greaseubiquity  http   r evold ca greaseubiquity   doing the following did not seem like a good idea   pre  code void docommand  in astring inputstr     code   pre  because it impedes the possibility of a more complex input  and i could not come up with an acceptable dynamic input to handle any possible js input 
i'll try to keep a long story short  what my script basically does is just inject other files  scripts css images  into an existing website  these injected scripts run inside the target page itself  there are some reasons to do this    the target page and injected scripts are written against the qooxoo framework  every javascript class is inside its own file    i don't want to merge all these separate files into one huge scripts  so each file is defined as an " resource"   injected scripts run directly inside the page itself and 'escape' the restrictions of the sandbox since an " resource" can be anything  i need to know a way to dynamically detect the mimetype because injecting a script is different from injecting a css or an image you can have a look in my script  http   userscripts org scripts review 138566 there is a function loadextensions  info is an instance of gm_info   i propose that gm_info not only gives me the names of the resources that are defined in a script  but also any other information you can derive  such as mimetype  for backwards compatibility it's probably best not to touch the existing gm_info resources array  but maybe you could add a new array of 'resourceinfo' objects  containing 'name'  'url'  'mimetype' and maybe other information you could share about the " resources"
1 2 3 i mean we can replace them with a very dumb  proxy  https   developer mozilla org docs web javascript reference global_objects proxy   gm object will be the proxy  just returning all the functions asked  the functions are just forwarding the messages  and move all the logic present in some of the functions to backend  i guess the proxy may be smaller than the generated code in the maximum configuration and the same for all the scripts  so no dynamic code generation on each injection  if we could put 2 separate scripts in the same context  the problem is that i don't know how this would affect memory consumption and performance 
sorry  is that better 
anything after 0 9 8 results in this behavior  tested on 3 machines  i don't get it  only changes in 0 9 9 are 
for the test only one  youtube center   but it makes no difference which script or how many  one script is enough to get this issue 
firefox 22  new profile  install gm 1 11  restart the browser  install any userscript from uso  i e  http   userscripts org scripts show 83584   it also has a custom icon    after installation  go to about addons and double click on the installed userscript  and the result is as expected    1  https   f cloud github com assets 3539609 885865 4575e4c2 f9dd 11e2 82b8 1b4665b7d2f0 jpg  close the addon manager  and hit the install button on the userscript page again  then reopen the addon manager and doubleclick on the userscript  the result will be this    2  https   f cloud github com assets 3539609 885866 49b70cdc f9dd 11e2 9260 91618677eea3 jpg  no icon and "last update" will say "thursday  january 01  1970" the expected result should look like the first image  this also happens if you close and reopen the browser between the two installations  i have no idea  why this was working fine right after #1744 was fixed  as now this errors also happens with 1 8 and earlier  which wasn't the case when i reported the bug the first time  maybe i wasn't testing as thoroughly as i thought 
ok    i've found the culprit that breaks 1 16b3 youtube link cleaner  http   userscripts org scripts show 108606 i guess 1 16b3 has a problem with the "match" lines of this script    capture  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3327540 2688596 981179be c2b2 11e3 8e44 fe7c6fb46af8 png  as of now userscripts org is currently down so here's a gm_script folder with only the problematic script  https   www dropbox com s vq3g393qe6gtbht gm_scripts_with_only_1_script rar error console  this error line i don't get with the "reduced" gm_scripts but i got it with my original big gm_scripts folder  syntaxerror  invalid quantifier matchpattern js 105 this error line i get in all the situations i've tested  even with gm 1 15   object errorevent  promise jsm 770 nextvalue   this onreject nextvalue  
the namespace idea is good  +1  any is better than none 
sorry my bad  it was a script that was causing the problem 
before i go looking for something that i might have disabled    can you point me in the right direction of where i should be looking for that  i thought they disabled the error console years ago   if it's the web developer console  nothing in that shown for this issue 
 tobbexiv your response got me thinking  in firefox i tried both web and browser consoles  open at the same time across a selection of web pages  exceptions from everywhere are reported in the browser console but not the web console  so it seems that firebug and the web console are displaying the same logging information  from all sources  userscripts  add ons and web javascript  so i'm going to guess that this is being addressed with firebug 3 and it's not a specific issue with greasemonkey 
then every change to that expression should be accepted by users  unless maybe the expression is simple enough to be sure the domain didn't change  i think that would be a separate issue though  but for regular expression changes this should probably be the message 
storage is working 
interesting  thanks for taking a look  sxderp   1  yup i am able to individually download the requires 2  just tried it with a fresh profile and that seemed to fix it  3  strangely  it was reported to me by many different users the day firefox 57 shipped is there something i can do to my old profile to get it working again on there 
no i actually got denied  https   openuserjs org scripts lomacks reddit_mouseover_popup_image_viewer it is a really old one but still worked in my older browser so was going to test but when i tried to install got error forbidden 
i don't expect there to be much of a performance gain right now  i just think it would better highlight the pure words  also it could enable better compiler optimization in the future if anybody was to touch the compiler again  but i'm no expert in compiler optimizations so this could be completely wrong 
 mrjbq7 certainly  i'm always interested in contributions that improve the implementations  especially if they make it more idiomatic  fyi  the original factor implementation was done by  jordanlewis
the problem was first observed in version 0 9 6 10 of refinery after i uploaded it to heroku  i tried to debugged it locally and found that the plugins were being loaded twice  once with respect to the relative path and once with respect to the absolute path  the farthest back i can trace it to is the method "add_plugin_load_paths" in initializer rb  i can't explain why running without the debugger is fine 
what i want to do is to use rails generator to generate models  1  i use  rails g model comment title string content text  in a refinerycms engine folder  2  it returns  please use rake task to generate a dummy app first 
    after one of the callback  started get " refinery images insert callback image_added app_dialog true dialog true"  i get the following           cache   post  refinery images insert true dialog true  invalidate  pass cache   post  refinery images insert true dialog true  invalidate  pass does this mean "invalid password" or "i don't have it in cache  than i'll load it from env"   anyway i really don't know if it is pertinent or not    
yes  np   
i think  this  http   blog 10to1 be rails 2011 03 22 localizing javascript in your rails app   can be the solution  i didn't tried it yet  but i will try to implement it as soon as i will have time 
done thank you
not yet  i need to ponder the issue first  in my particular project i am just going to remove the id field on the menu items as i do not use them  do you think that would be a generally suitable solution  or do you think many other folks make use of the id field for these menu items 
i'll take a closer look today and see if either of these helps 
i doesn't happen in pow 0 3 2  thanks 
sure  guess this can be closed now 
done  just issued a pull request

 parndt i'd be happy do help  but before i roll up my sleeves and try to track this down  can you  or anyone else  please help me verify that on your machine  when you create a new refinery v1 0 9 app  and you bring it up in thin  you get http response headers containing  cache control  max age 0  private  must revalidate   as well as a different etag value on every page load   i'd like to know that it's not just me doing something wrong  but actually a code issue  thanks  marc
many thanks for the prompt reply  that resolved all problems    
 parndt there is still a minor problem  when you append the load_seed command to the seeds rb file  you don't first append a new line  so i ended up with 
yes  in the pages rb initializer 
i'll give it a go  thank you for quickly reacting to this 
away from the office now but think i used home brew   not sure though  what's the best way to reinstall  do you know which ruby rails versions work best on mountain lion and with refinery  ps saw this error on stack overflow with another platform and tried adding cc as gcc per suggestion instead of llvm on bash profile path but no fix  i can use refinery on lion but want to get 10 8 refinery working  thanks  peggy on jun 23  2012  at 1 34 pm  philip arndtreply reply github com wrote

well    yes   the cdn is aws cloudfront   i hadn't considered the fetching via the cdn  but in hindsight it does make sense  however still something that needs a bit more documentation   do you think it would be something to add to the existing docs  or create a new article altogether for it 
that was it    sorry for the false alert  i should have remembered that doing an uninstall  'rbenv rehash'  new install and 'rbenv rehash' again has given me a working  clean setup thanks

no  also  it looks like 1 6 0 has been yanked   the changelog for 1 6 1 reads  i don't know what they're talking about  but the fact that they reverted something indicates to me that they found a bug  i think we can close this  thanks

sure  it's pretty big since this is a production project 
 force_ssl   true  causes an infinite loop in our case  the rails application is getting http requests because cloudfront is terminating ssl  this setting also has a lot of side effects that i'd like to avoid  do you think there is something a bit more specific to what i want 
thank you very much  i'm sorry about this 
 ajdavis   yes   yieldpoints cancel  is it        i did not know about  yieldpoints     yieldpoints     works with python3  
this is on gentoo  we have twisted split into parts  e g  twisted  core   twisted names  twisted conch  etc  since upstream also offers tarballs along these lines  this seems like a  somewhat  supported scenario  so  i have twisted installed  11 0 0   but not twisted names 
nope  kali linux and python is compiled with openssl 
i had thought that the far future check would help us in the cases where the browser kept the cookie beyond its expiration   but given what you say   maybe this is not the correct way of doing that    i don't know anything about the 'real solution' you mention above  i'll have to investigate that further  can you point me at the right part of the code 
current master  when i submitted that fix  it worked  but checking out 3 2 1 now gives the same error  i wonder whether something changed in distutils 
honestly i can't think of anything that might add that header  but it has been too long and the problem fell out of my schedule  i think that there's value if someone else finds the same problem and googles for it  and i'll come back with more information if i get the chance again  thanks 
this is my code   i configure the proxy in requests    proxies    'http' 'http   10 10 1 10 3128'  req   requests get 'http   icanhazip com '  proxies proxies  headers headers  timeout 10    when i use the same proxy in tornado has the error    tornado curl_httpclient curlerror  http 599  recv failure  connection reset by peer   or   tornado curl_httpclient curlerror  http 599  operation timed out after 10000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received  
no exceptions are triggered  and i can't really really reproduce it  it just happens every couple of hours  more often under higher load  i connected gdb to the running process after it was frozen  and it always seems to hang when acquiring a lock on syslog  it hangs on the following piece of code in  usr lib python2 7 threading py  which is called from  usr lib python2 7 logging __init__ py  line 698   the weird thing is that the process doesn't seem to hang instantly  when looking at the closing connection states they seem to slowly increase over time  until the process hangs or the tcp listen buffer overflows  i'm not completely sure which comes first   and all connections fail  luckily upgrading to python 3 seems to resolve the issue  so as far as i'm concerned the issue can be closed  although i'd be very interested to know what exactly was going on  
 bdarnell i just updated the url in the samples above to a valid one  can you check again please  i also made sure to check if the request works fine in other ip ranges  as this are video streams  using head to check their content size would be quite important  the head method works fine using curl   also  changing the client to  curlasynchttpclient  fixes this issue for me 
maybe it is a dupe  haven't read in detail  linux always keeps ipv6 half enabled because the ipv4 and ipv6 stack share routing table and arp implementation and more  when its turned off  its only turning off the outer layer that you access  i don't know how getaddrinfo is deciding   1 is a good idea  maybe that is a separate problem  but the documentation for it says to keep iterating until successful  hiding the error is not exactly what i'm suggesting  you can catch the exception and output a warning to stderr and then iterate to the next address offered by getaddrinfo since the ipv4 address is next in the list  because ipv6 can include ipv4 addresses  its offered first  but we can just iterate to the next address  if the list becomes exhausted  then a stronger message is appropriate and perhaps even exiting the application  but a traceback leaves people with more questions than actionable answers  the current way to disable ipv6 is add the following sysctls  net ipv6 conf all disable_ipv6   1 net ipv6 conf default disable_ipv6   1 and that will do it  thanks for looking into this issue  i appreciate it 
i just ask the admin of the   centos   machine to upgrade python   tornado  it works right  sorry here 
the main reason i'm using this method is because this is the easiest way to get it to work with amazon elastic beanstalk 
hello  it is 4 5 3 and the other  where blog example works  is 5 1  i did upgrade of tornado and it works now    sorry for bothering you  i feel like an idiot now  p  thanks for help 
 mivade i didn't manage to reproduce the error  except on my production environment  it's certainly something related to the specific environment  but i haven't figured out what  manifesting itself only in production makes it difficult for me to experiment  i am inclined to think that it may be some third party app  like newrelic or sentry  which hook into tornado for their instrumentation 
 tdreyno ah right  that's probably the cause of this then  the mime type should be  text x component  for  htc  files  so this is not related to the pathing  the browser saying "file not found" at the  localhost 4567 assets css pie htc  path   thanks once again 
whoops  sorry about that   didn't notice the new version  bug squashed   
just simple  in config rb fires "file not found hello index html"  request processing chain for now  middleman rc5   app before  middleman  coreextensions  routing  app before  middleman  base  app error  middleman  base  app not_found  middleman  base  process_request  middleman  base  that's what i said  middleman  coreextensions  routing intercepts given route and treats it as directory by pushing index html to the end  i think this should be up to user whether turn on this apache emulation or not 
sure  can i just send it to your publicly listed address in your profile 
i'm doing something like this   but when i do  middleman build  i still don't get all of this in a single css file

looks like it's specifically a  svgz issue  i completed more testing and was able to load an  svg correctly  maybe it's a matter of including one extra mime type for thin  win 7   32bit middleman 2 0 6

well  that was easy    thanks 
got around it by installing rvm   bundler  and using a gemfile  sorted 
i am using 3 0 beta 3 directly off the github master branch  i am referring to server mode  build mode is fine  if i make changes to the the partial  save the file  then refresh in the browser  its still the old file  http 304   even if i force refresh to bypass the browser cache  the file being served is still the old one  only way to refresh is to change anything in the "main" file 
although  middleman  should use  bundle exec   i've run it with  bundle exec middleman  too  additionally  following the backtrace i followed earlier  i've found there was a conflict in my  config rb  file  i attempted to correct it  but it only uncovered other problems  i read this issue arises from an incompatibility between the latest alpha version of the sass gem and compass  i added the following to my  gemfile  
same result with rc4  source is at https   github com watusi jquery mobile iscrollview in the "demo" directory 
 tdreyno sorry for the delay  i was on vacation  and no  this didn't work  and yes  is with middleman 3 0 0 version 
 background  url asset path 'images slider left png'   no repeat 0 0  
you can find the configuration  and more stuff  here  https   gist github com 4154399 rendering is passed through pandoc  so everything is a bit more involved  the only instance variable i can think of is used in  index html haml  of each 'post'  however  i am quire sure that this is not the problem  here is a bit of debugging output to the console  middleman  2 0 16 1   the second invocation should have also printed out the post with the "applicative functors"  that is what i clicked on and also what the url said  so  the  post instance variable should not be the cause  the  posthelper load_post  function was already called with the wrong argument  that is the wrong directory  
hi  i'm on middleman 3 07  it seemed to 'make' the erb version itself  i started with just  styles css scss  and when i started the server it created the erb one  should i try removing that file and re starting the server  when i've cracked this i promise i'll write up a fairly thorough tutorial on setting up and using middleman for the less 'programmer' minded  hopefully that way it will save you this pain in future  also  not sure if it is relevant but the  styles css scss  is essentially a list of partials which also reside in the css folder  e g

sorry i am always useless at writing decent issues  i will strive to get better  ok   before with sprockets we could add an include path so shortcut to the bower_components folder  that bower_components would become part of the include path  so calling       require bootstrap sass official assets javascripts bootstrap sprockets would work when calling in the required js or css file so assumption from the middleman guides of import_path file expand_path  'bower_components'  root   was that it would do the same thread on forum about it   https   forum middlemanapp com t import a scss file in bower components folder using middleman 4 2011
 bhollis i was wrong  the rubyracer is on a third party template not in middleman 
i found the issue    abridged  config rb      my  config rb  had a  def config  in the  helpers do  block that was overwriting middleman's config  renaming the method to  site_config  seems to have done the trick 
i'm referring to the  asset_hash  directive that is part of the default middleman 4 build  i suspect that it is part of the "asset pipeline" behavior  yes  middleman 4 is not rc or alpha  so published documentation ought to reflect that  the vast majority of users are not going to be familiar with the goings on of development  and rely on the documentation to provide necessary communication 
hi  bhollis  i'll close this issue as it was solved simple by configure the assets path to point to the root  like so   i tried this before but used     instead of       because of that i couldn't make it work 
i do believe so  they mention it specifically here  https   github com sstephenson sprockets also  it works fine with rails when i do similar things  just can't get it to work similarly here 
this works  erb 
getting this in chrome console   uncaught error  argumenterror  wrong number of arguments  4 for 1    no other backtraces in terminal and app  using the latest bootstrap sass from github 
thanks  gabebw    tdreyno i tried both those things  no change  i've got the source for you here  https   github com iparr middlemanmess the issues happens with 'venues' and 'corporate' 
my  gemfile lock  is this    
in between writing the original post and now  i managed to fix the error  by adding   git    'https   github com slim template slim'  to the gemfile after  require 'slim'   adding  set  slim   layout_engine     slim   slim  engine set_options  pretty    true  to config rb and changing the default file extension to   slim  i managed to fix it  however  now i'm getting a completely different error  my posts do not build correctly  and don't give any error  instead give off only code  see example  http   www valiantghost com 2015 05 grape surgery   if i change the file extension of a post to   html md  then again i get a build error again  in the build directory  what i see are the files  but without an extension  i e  2015 05 15 grape surgery  instead of  2015 05 15 grape surgery html   leading them to be unable to be read  in the original case  the only error message thrown was an error next to the file when using  middleman build  
i've cut the contents of one file down and the below causes the crash  the file is here in tar gz format  http   fvg no 5mcreative com  pcr en md tar gz
it doesn't load the plugin at all  i don't think sprockets is suppose to work like this 
yep  check it out  https   imgur com a wqwte
i can try monday
i guess best solution would be to catch the exception and print an error complaining about an unexpected character encoding and pointing towards the "encoding" setting  the encoding setting should also be documented more clearly in the docs  i thought a while about the problem and i doubt it makes sense to mix two character sets in one file  front matter + content   i also doubt it makes sense to mix different character sets in one middleman project at all 
already did that  i'm actually trying to run the tests for https   github com middleman middleman asciidoc here's the gemfile lock 
livereload doesn't seem to be the issue  however  when i comment out   partial current_page data header  then it worked  i then played with where i was defining that frontmatter  at first  i had it outside the  wrap_layout  in  layouts profile haml   which broke it  it also didn't work inside of the  wrap_layout   when i put it in  profile decks haml   everything worked  so i guess the frontmatter can't be declared inside a nested template  it has to be in the end file  thanks for the help 
i traced the error  i have this line in my config set  index_file  "index htm" and this caused the pretty url to not work  fwiw under v3 this option also did not create the correct target file as described in the documentation here https   middlemanapp com advanced pretty_urls 
 tdreyno thanks for the prompt reply  😀 as suggested i've tried the following and it does correctly prefix   i think linking to the directory feels cleaner  i am happy to put together a pr to add support to linking to directories with  http_prefix  if you would accept the patch  thoughts 
 tdreyno thanks for your help  it now working 
you can use this new syntax with ruby 2 4 and later   reidcooper i tried that also  doesn't work 
thanks for having a look  it simply asks me for my password over and over again 
no issues here  just noticed it while trying to diagnose a problem i was having with one of our scripts 
 bitprophet when  raw_input  got a empty string  the loop will break up
when i run python and enter that in  nothing happens  it just goes to   no i don't think i used easy_install for anything  but it has been a while since i set everything up  is there a way i can double check to see if anything was installed using easy_install 
i have patch here   https   github com jmdcal fabric compare fabric master   master it raises an exception instead of prompting 
fyi  as of now  after some googling  i've applied a "workaround hack" as mentioned in http   stackoverflow com questions 2276200 changing default encoding of python  putting  reload sys   and stuff in first lines of my fabfile py   seems to "work for me now tm "  but unfortunately it's reported as   "dangerous  may break basic stuff in language"   according to  a comment in the stackoverflow thread  http   stackoverflow com questions 2276200 changing default encoding of python#comment2240875_2276222   this particular script is currently non critical for me  so i can live with the risk   georgepsarakis  
ah  i don't know why i didn't see that  too much coffee    thanks 
thank you  kaaveland this is exactly what i was looking for  is there also a way to abort the execution of tasks  i couldn't find anything to stop the execution here http   docs fabfile org en 1 10 usage execution html i tried to raise an exception  but it did not stop the execution of the second task   sys exit    did not work either 
i was just thinking if someone managed to get a fabfile installed in   it could be a problem  but then i guess you have bigger problems because your system would be compromised  i just found the behaviour very strange 
thank you very much i just found the error is a ereur my share
thank you for your answer  i was looking for a more native way like the one you describe at first  but you are right  calling them as functions works totally fine and solves the problem 
# code list below   # issue when executing the run method  it throw symtemexit exception 
nope  currently i'm using macos mojave  seems like excluded apple dev sdks from macos mojave led to this issue  so clean install high sierra instead of mojave  download the necessary soft and the following upgrade to mojave works just fine  still dunno in which module of apple sdks problem is  so it's maybe critical in future  cause of inability of new macs to install previous versions of macos

simen  thanks for the reply  i have just downloaded the edge branch  i saw somewhere there was a fix done for the circular buffer overflow problem  i am trying to merge my code with the edge code and then see if it is fixed  i have done some modifications already to suit my pc application that feeds the controller  you can still use the   dump and update feature but i added some commands to get status from the controller as well as the settings in one string format  i am not having much fun with git as i never used it before so my merge is a manual one  on 2011 07 30 10 55 pm  simen wrote  ## regards   groete marius d  liebenberg mastercut cc cel  +27 82 698 3251 tel  +27 12 743 6064 fax  +27 86 551 8029 skype  marius_d liebenberg skype me™  skype marius_d liebenberg call get skype http   www skype com go download and call me for free 
when the pause state is checked  i just skipped the step interrupt routine and wait for 'play' state in next interrupt  if pause state is changed it into 'play'  then step output restarts without accel deccel  so the step motor usually stalls except very slow feedrate in my cnc

since i wanted a right turning axis system  and starting with z 0 on the top of my object  resulting in everything i cut away has a positive increasing z coordinate  my axis are in the left rear corner  with y pointing towards yourself  with x to the right and z pointing down  switches are at the rear  left and top 
i am trying to create circular shapes mostly like spiral etc  and even homing is an issue  
yes  i'm french  as you can also understand by my poor english   why you think that my feed rates are creazy  i checked again and and re wired switches  i have 5v when "outside" and 0v when trigerred   now both on x and y axis   when i request the homing  x axis seems ok  y axis arrive in homing position and i can ear 6 or 7 "clac" before having the homing fail

hi  this issue was a comment on this  http   gunicorn org configure html#framework settings part of the docs asking anyone who had ideas on how to make framework specific settings available to django apps  the twod wsgi package does just that and should enable you to treat a django app the same as a paster application  hope that clear things up a bit     ben
you're right  i was using a sync worker  default vanilla settings  the http call is rather short   100ms   looks like i'll have to go async to keep it from locking  found a workaround in the meantime  i'll investigate async when i re attack the problem 
nginx consumes 100  cpu after gunicorn is shut down and the sockets remain there  perhaps this is more of an issue to take up with nginx  https   skitch com adamnelson ruu7c ubuntu ip 10 242 226 66 var www dev yipit env yipit ssh 106x50
  davisp    i'm heavy user of buildout      bin django     manage py  i've tested it with gunicorn_django wrapper and the same test passes  so translation needs to be reliable  thanks      tilgovi    i guess run_gunicorn was failing due to the fact that at begining it imports  translation    from django utils import translation  this unfortunately initializes threading prior to monkey pathing  i guess the solution might be to document that  in case of django    k gevent  shall be only executed from gunicorn_django wrapper 
i've tried without buildout  and djangorecipe  and same thing happens  here's an example app  https   github com pigletto gunicorn_test_plain
using gevent 1 0b1  https   bitbucket org denis gevent get 745149cd866d tar gz    since the "stable" 0 x one has dns issues  though i'm noticing now they have a 1 0b2    but i imagine the same issue would happen no matter which gevent i was using   no 
hi benoit  sorry  but i am not too familiar with github  i am looking at this location  but do not see any new version of djangoapp py  https   github com benoitc gunicorn tree master gunicorn app the page says that djangoapp py was last modified 3 months ago   the current content of the file is the same as what i have  i also could not find any mention of #340 in the commit history  could you please point me to the right version  thank you   igor     from  benoit chesneau reply reply github com to  shmain shmain yahoo com sent  monday  may 14  2012 6 25 pm subject  re   gunicorn  django project not found    with django 1 4 project structure  #340  fixed in last head  thanks for the ticket      reply to this email directly or view it on github  https   github com benoitc gunicorn issues 340#issuecomment 5703863
yes  you're right  i want to say is that you say it  1  in my work  i deploy my application by paster  it allow to define multiple applications in a single file  each application goes in its own section  like i configured above  2  when i lanuch app  i use command of 'paster serve    ini'   then paster shall run  app main   and using command of 'paster serve   app name admin   server name admin'  system shall run  app admin   3  but when i switch server to guincorn  then the above command  the system will only start an application  app main   4  paster can launching 2 different app by different config and parameter  you look it  paster deployment  http   pythonpaste org deploy #id12  hope your answer  thanks 
i'm using the  gunicorn  command line with commands that look like this  https   github com willowtreeapps wsgi sandbox blob f438d3c87e07059cfbc7cae0f308d95686b72bf1 supervisord conf#l30  note that i'm not using    preload   provide a package installed with setuptools and  zip_safe false   bump the version number and issue a hup  the workers reload but the sys path is stale at that point  as indicated in the issue text

you're right  the binary thing is a red herring  it looks like this fails   but replacing "yield  'ok' " with "return  'ok' " works fine  am i reading the spec wrong  http   www python org dev peps pep 0333  "when called by the server  the application object must return an iterable yielding zero or more strings  this can be accomplished in a variety of ways  such as by returning a list of strings  or by the application being a generator function that yields strings  or by the application being a class whose instances are iterable  regardless of how it is accomplished  the application object must always return an iterable yielding zero or more strings " i can't tell if this means you're not allowed to yield list of strings 
hi benoitc  thanks a lot for your reply  i don't know how to create a pr or a patch  i also do not think my english is good enough to be in the doc as you can see from my words     ps  do i have the privilege to add a label  i don't find a way to add a "documentation" label in the issue  thanks and regards 
hi benoitc  thanks  i have solved upgrading these packages  gevent  1 0a3 greenlet  0 4 0   
awesome  can i see an example of usage of  worker_exit  somewhere   i'm a little unclear on how you could get a stacktrace of the worker  the emailing part i can do  
 benoitc nowhere  django recognize self application  when  models py  in application  understand 
a note on which workers are compatible with python 3 would be perfect 
yep   preload  solved the problem  thanks  oh i didn't know  pserve  used it    code reload is not a problem   we start another gunicorn instance group  update upstreams in nginx config  then   etc init d nginx reload     but usr2 method may be more convenient  i will try it  thanks
start is described at the beginning of the description  are you looking for anything else in particular  as for gevent version  i'll check in a bit  on jun 11  2014 5 49 pm  "randall leeds" notifications github com wrote 
sorry  i have absolutely no context for why it was happening other than the fact that it was _master_  as of the time of the post  my production was broken  so i had to blow it away  i figured that something else had probably just been fixed  and  hopefully  you'd recognize it  better than not mentioning it at all  i'm waiting for a release to fix the stopiteration and the "must end with  py" configuration issue  if i upgrade any of my other applications' gunicorns  they'll break 
tornado 4 0 1 gunicorn 19 1 1 python 2 7 6 how can i list "available" workers 
thank you for your reply  i have it on our production servers  will try to produce a local example of this error 
 collinanderson that would guard against the script being executed directly  but i don't think that is a concern  i suggested  '__wsgi__'  but  '__main__'  would probably be fine as well 
i have enabled the debugging  will let you know as soon as the problem appears again 
we run gunicorn with supervisord  nothing really fancy  i believe what happened was that the server was rebooted  and a few gunicorns did not shutdown in time  so when the server came up again their old pid files were still there  but now the pids belonged to gunicorns from other users  the server runs a bunch of projects as different users  
we are using 19 1 1
by later i only meant "later" down in the code of that file  the  membership_models membership  is what's throwing an attribute error because it doesn't realize its been imported at the top of the file  to repeat myself slightly  this is intermittent and so it fails sometimes and other times it passes  i'm not sure how else to debug this  fwiw  we've just upgraded to django 1 8 on the app which contains this code and we are no longer having this issue  so it does indeed seem related to something between gunicorn 19 3 0 and django 1 4  but i'm not sure what that might be  i've updated the code snippet so the word "later" no longer exists 
yes selinux is enabled  up to now  i have arranged it so the system is working correctly  i did not have any alert while this issue was present  the python version i am using is 3 4  the command line is the following      home carmen  virtualenvs airp bin gunicorn air wsgi application  c  home carmen 00_server settings gunicorn_air conf py  i also tested it one more time  upgrading to 19 4 2 the issue appears  donwgrading to 19 4 1 everything works great 
 syaiful6 currently 4 cpus are process on server  according to you i have to set   workers 4 right   benoitc at a time 12 15 users are logged in the system and doing some activity  gunicorn caught more memory due to this cpu utilization is more and system is hung 
 benoitc well   i didn't actually want to use hexadecimal  it was just the easiest example to show gunicorn not working as documented  octal  on the other hand  is much friendlier than decimal for setting a umask and i spent quite a while trying to figure out why my permissions were all wrong before i realised the octal number i'd passed to gunicorn   0117   was being interpreted as decimal   117   instead of what the documentation suggests   int '0117'  0       79   
i ended up with a running gunicorn process logging a failure to connect every n seconds    i think  sorry  my memory is fuzzy a month later 
sorry for the late reply  benoitc  the issue i'm seeing is actually the non active threads doing this  my active threads don't timeout  my the non active ones under less load give more critical timeout errors than just gracefully timing out  i switched from gevent to tornado and that seems to have fixed the hang issue but i'm still seeing 3 workers consistently giving the critical timeout every 30 seconds  if it's a normal timeout it shouldnt be a critical error 
hello  benoitc  thanks for your prompt reply  i have checked out gunicorn at the specified branch and commit in #1483 and installed it into the virtual environment  unfortunately  the same error keeps reappearing 
 tilgovi   the configuration  version  gunicorn  19 7 1 btw  i have also tested sync greenevent worker  but got the same result  i'll do some debug today  if anything useful i'll update here 
thanks for your answers    i'm using gunicorn in combination with flask   i don't know if flask spawns any threads  couldn't find something useful about that   tilgovi what is the simple example you used in trying to reproduce it  i would like to try that myself and see if it behaves differently
em my fault  it should not be an issue  but what i intend to say is gunicorn maybe can get benefit from faster http parser
sorry for the delayed response  we have set the configuration in the gunicorn configuration  the value for the worker  worker class and threads are mentioned  nginx acts as a reverse proxy in the set up  the invocation is possibly handled by nginx  i am interested to know if the spinning of threads is dependant on the number of processors 
that actually worked  i wonder why 
 jamadden thanks for the quick answering  as for  gevent  we did not try it  i gave it a quick go now and i get the exact same traceback  as for preloading  no  we were not doing it  the gunicorn config is the following 
i will try to create a sample server and upload it here  it is more related to ssl tls version  the requests urllib3 bug you pointed out are on client side  where requests is writing data to socket  in my bug  gunicorn is writing data to socket not requests 
hi benoit  thanks for your reply  i am aware of the danger of having an object shared in memory  let me explain my intention   was thinking how to store let's say user session data  which becomes a problem when you spawn more than one worker  actually  i am solving it now by starting a simple socket server  kasi  https   github com lhotakj kasi   before  gunicorn     i could have use eg   redis  but i preferred something small which doesn't require installation  however i still think it could be achieved internally by  gunicorn  like another process  exactly as you proposed     it's not completely ready  missing readme  tests  install  but the server client work well  thanks   
hi all  thx for reply  the log level is not issue here  i discovered that just by accident  the service was running in different environments without any issues  and somehow now  by using restler or curl  each worker is now blocked for 60sec  after i debug messages on the console  i can not explain  why that happens   i am using  gthreads  and now they get blocked  as the gunicorn maintains the open connection for 60sec  i switched to another web server  on the same machine  same environment  and the issue is gone  so it was definitely gunicorn  1 process  4 threads   i have few more service which are running with guni  and they seems to be ok  so i will need to investigate the source a bit more  i have often read about  keep alive  here    so need to validate  r
i am not sure     i am trying to found how can i pass the log file name dynamically and not predefine as a string in args
it's a healthcheck 
 benoitc sry for replay so late  you see  it just loop over and over again when i have only about 20 models  it just works fine but not ok for more than 100 models  there is no error in the log  that's my gunicorn config import multiprocessing bind   '0 0 0 0 9898' workers   2 backlog   2048 worker_class   "gevent" worker_connections   3000 daemon   false
command line looks like this  again slightly modified to anonymize  
 benoitc i am sorry abort closing issue  yeh  what i want to talk about is a mechanism similar to https   blog qualys com securitylabs 2011 11 02 how to protect against slow http attacks  i found gunicorn has not implementing such a mechanism，so i close this issue 
i think you misunderstand the issue  the "but" in your example is indeed a given step  but if you used "go to definition on it" you'd receive feedback saying that it doesn't exist and the generated code to copy into the clipboard labels it as a "then" step  not a "given" step   even if you define a given step for it  it won't be found because the ide integration sees it as a then step  the bug does not seem to apply to "and"  only "but"
that's a good point  i was _expecting_ it to retry beforetestrun for every test it was going to run  until the initialization has succeeded exactly once  it does the retrying  so that's in line with my expectations  what is a bug in my opinion is that the second time around  it will run beforetestrun _twice_  so for a total of 3 times  even though the second call succeeded  although i suppose failing the entire test run because the initialization failed would also be correct behavior 
i guess i just assumed that the "general purpose"  beforescenario  the one without any limitation by a tag  would always be executed first   before any more specific  more targeted  beforescenario "extrasetup"   methods  that are most focused  specific to a given situation  i really don't want to clutter up my general purpose setup method with code that's only ever needed in two  of my rather many  scenarios     and i don't like the idea of having to explicitly call my "general purpose" setup method from the specific "extra setup" methods  either        hmmm      not quite happy with this situation here

 sabotageandi i have a  net core application with  dependencies  "specflow"  "2 1 0" tools  "specflow netcore"  "1 0 0 rc7" feature file that gives error   and that works  thanks  george
yes  followed and 2 days back i have added a feature and step  but today i have deleted then which i have added sample features then tried to create new feature files   but failed to generate steps for that feature 
in reality  i got the issue solved by not upgrading to that version of specflow  unfortunately  one of the multiple quality steps is executed by our build script detects the warning and fails the build  as such  we can execute the tests without problems  so i don't know if you are going to resolve this or not  there are ways to specify in your nuget spec that the minimum version is 9  but is opened to whatever somebody else is using  or limit it to a tested version   the issue appears because the nuspec file contains the following code   this will specify the minimum version of 9 0 1  all the way up to version 10 0 x  i have tested version 10 and it works as expected  this prevents nuget downloading the new package  if you want me  i can create a pull request with it  although the change is pretty minimal 
hi  created a new project called "references" in my solution and added the web reference to it  added reference from this to my specflow project and can confirm   that i am not getting the slowdown   when analyzing new bindings now    vsbindingregistrybuilder_2  https   user images githubusercontent com 23498757 35386027 599b5e18 01c2 11e8 8c36 99a6282e0c37 jpg  i assume the issue arises because this is added to the app config file     applicationsettings   saxonwebautomation properties settings   setting name "saxonwebautomation_sforcetestcs81_sforceservice" serializeas "string"   value https   xxxx salesforce com services soap c 41 0 xxxxxxxxxxxxx  value    setting    saxonwebautomation properties settings    applicationsettings

i'm using a hook with  beforetestrun  but i didn't change anything in there so it shouldn't have an influence to it  only i added "property group" to my csproj because i wanted don't have always feature cs on my git after build solution or project  my logs from jenkins  ofc  i changed the name of the project + paths are shorter   11 37 44 1  teardown error   mytest 11 37 44 system nullreferenceexception   object reference not set to an instance of an object  11 37 44 teardown   system nullreferenceexception   object reference not set to an instance of an object  11 37 44 at automationtests settings seleniumhooks beforetestrun   in seleniumhooks cs line 37 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 11 37 44 at mytest   in mytest line 0 11 37 44   teardown 11 37 44 at mytestin mytest line 0 11 37 44   i checked size of feature cs files and creation date and it looks as these feature cs are created in correct way  my feature cs files are inculed on the project  btw  i want to don't have feature cs after every build of my project or a whole solution  because it's always appearing on the git  do you know any other way which will help me achieve this solution   ofc  when i'm using nunit console runner 
hi  currently does not work  if i run or debug specflow scenarios test from feature file  i get the error message "no tests found to run" 
that seems to have fixed it   do these steps need to be followed every time a feature file is added  do these issues only apply to  net core and specflow v3+   i am having the same issue on my project using specflow 2 4 with  net v4 5 and was just trying to create a completely fresh project as an example 
 sabotageandi i don't quite follow your question  sorry for that  we do have coded ui test and we have unit tests that achieve the same result  our problem lies in getting the individual steps of specflow to run inside a specific context  q  if i run a unit test inside a specflow test  i would have to setup the context of each fact test to run the required testing code inside it   start a thread  add the testing code to the dispatcher queue  running the dispatcher  then waiting for results  is it possible to achieve something like that using specflow plugins 
6 of the projects in my solution only contain the  feature files  i choose one of them to be the startup project  lets call that one projone  in the app config of projone  i have     specflow   stepassemblies   stepassembly assembly "commontestimplementation"     stepassembly assembly "projonetestimplementation"     stepassembly assembly "projtwotestimplementation"      stepassemblies   unittestprovider name "mstest v2"      specflow    _the "testimplementation" projects contain all the bindings cs files _ all the other test description projects also have their stepasseblies listed in their app config and their unittestprovider is set to mstest v2  i also followed this  thread   https   stackoverflow com questions 42481881 how can i generate specflow feature cs files with msbuild 47818375#47818375 recommendation on how to regenerate feature cs files during the build  so i added the following to projone csproj and all the other project files with  feature files     propertygroup   specflowtaskspath    packages specflow 2 3 1 tools specflow exe  specflowtaskspath    propertygroup   import project "   packages specflow 2 3 1 tools techtalk specflow tasks" condition "exists '   packages specflow 2 3 1 tools techtalk specflow tasks' "     import project "   packages specflow 2 3 1 tools techtalk specflow targets" condition "exists '   packages specflow 2 3 1 tools techtalk specflow targets' "     import project "   packages mstest testadapter 1 3 2 build net45 mstest testadapter targets" condition "exists '   packages mstest testadapter 1 3 2 build net45 mstest testadapter targets' "     import project "   packages specflow 2 3 1 build specflow targets" condition "exists '   packages specflow 2 3 1 build specflow targets' "     
ok i tried that and it worked fine 
thanks for the comments  gasparnagy and  sabotageandi in typical unit testing frameworks one test is one method so there is no issue for setting the synchronisation context of this one single method  in specflow this test method manifests into a series of steps invoked separately  from what i've seen the problem with specflow appears to be that when it is calling the steps it is treating async and sync step methods differently e g  the exclusivesynchronisationcontext is set for async method on every call  calling asynchelpers runsync   which overwrites any context that may have been set in previous steps  while sync methods have a null context  i need to look at specflow's source code  which i haven't done yet  to first confirm that what i think i saw is correct and then to try and identify an appropriate refactor that would guarantee a single synchronisation context instance for all steps in the scenario  if you don't have any further notes i will try to prepare a pull request demonstrating the proposed changes soon 
i get that right now  and no i used angle brackets to detail what was in each double quotes and forgot that it was markup    so it got removed  
hey  sabotageandi   the trace output when i run test from console line  i saw "given    " "when     " in terminal  do you think is it possible to fully disable it  in specflow 2 4  i set trace listener to nulllistener   then there is no output for this trace  but in specflow 3 latest version   i cannot disable the trace in the terminal  thanks a lot for your help

the specflow+runner version is 3 1 41  we were using the specflow xunit in azure pipeline without any issues but when we switched to specflow+ runner  all tests are skipped and logged the errors in the log file  there is no error when i run the tests in visual studio  is there any additional setup required for specflow+ runner in azure pipeline  thanks    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 15381009 72441951 99418580 3779 11ea 8681 cd920ad0d4c6 png 
it looks like it  adding the environment variable proposed in #1912 fixed the issue for me  thanks 
we have a windows 2008 web server edition path level may 2011 from phpmyfaq  apache 2 2 16  win32  php 5 3 3 db client version mysqlnd 5 0 7 dev   091210    revision  300533   db server version  5 1 51 community do you need more information

i got messed up in our company network  the it blocks a social network traffic  so facebook's "like" button does't appear  but a grey bar  sorry for the confusion
yes  i have  it is this centraline database  shall i send you an actual copy 
the user has no rights  but it has 2 groups assigned  viewer id3  and authors id2   the group viewer don't have the mentioned right  but the author group   it looks like only the viewer is evaluated  we can check this on my system  or do you want a backup 
 thorsten i need this feature for my project but i've already do a simple workaround  only for permissions not for languages   i would not share with you something that can be unuseful or counterproductive in your developing process  but just to figure out what i did    edited pmf_tags class constructor by adding second parameter of type pmf_user    edited all pmf_tags constructor calls by passing current user instance    edited  query definition in getalltags   function in pmf_tags class as follows   this operations are only for tags permissions through   faqdata_group    in my project i have all faqs with group level permission    i hope it is useful

unfortunately not because the db has sensitive information  but tested another thing i think that is where they are bug  my faqs are visible to two groups  i put one faq with 1 group only and only appear once    wired   
 winks this is from the apache log  not from my internal browser session  it was captured overnight  there have been others  i run fail2ban  in addition to other safeguards  so that once a request such as what i've provided is identified it is banned   thorsten i agree there isn't a source of that ip from the code within the repo  unfortunately  and not surprisingly  the ip address changes over time  it is very likely this will be a hard one to hunt down as there are so many external modules used in your offering  i do not think this is the direct fault of your code per se  but much more likely a consequence of one of your modules  the install i have  as well as the external test i asked a friend to do  was direct from your site link  not built  regular install which is just a file copy   2 8 24 was   is the version i've noticed this condition and replicated 
strange  the problem completely disappeared the day after  without changing any code  everything seems to be ok now  i tried upgrading and fresh install as well  always resulting in that problem  browser cache was cleared before testing  no clue  what caused the trouble  thanks for the great program and your support 
yes  'sed' was my friend in this case  if the entire faq has to be moved to another server domain  the url changes  maybe export import could handle the transform

tryed " lopen" after " syntasticcheck"  but it's empty  mac 10 6 8 
the function is defined and works  i have c vim in autoload syntastic  removing it fixes the error 
the sign in underlined because i have my highlight error group set to use and undercurl  the text above in the second image is supposed to be trailing white space highlighted using  set list   it's really the first character that's the problem though  see how it looks different than the others  it's like whatever was used to do the error highlighting stayed put  even though i inserted a couple of lines  how does syntastic do its error highlighting  i found that i turned it off  that i don't get the problem  maybe i can reproduce it with a lot less vimscript involved  i'm not using janus  though i am using several other plugins  i did try narrowing things down  i disabled nearly all of my plugins  and cut out most of my vimrc    but the problem still exists  it is actually detecting errors  in the case above  it was complaining about the block having the wrong indentation since i didn't implement  __init__     which is correct  it's just that the error highlighting is getting off when adding new lines  i'm still trying to narrow it down more  it's possible that it could be a bug in vim  i certainly haven't ruled it out 
yes it works on command line and on command mode in vim    phpcs     it's reporting a lot of violations of a coding standard errors that it's not catching in syntastic  i have this problem only with phpcs  php   phpmd are working like a charm inside of syntastic 
problem is gone  but now it throws  checker python pylint  can't parse version string  abnormal termination    tested with f79e9d2
actually it's working on the mac also but there is a problem     it doesn't show the errors in some cases    check both of this images that have missing " " but in one case it doesn't show the error   screen shot 2013 11 02 at 5 29 32 pm  https   f cloud github com assets 347712 1459398 ff114af8 43d3 11e3 8dd5 280747e3e078 png    screen shot 2013 11 02 at 5 28 35 pm  https   f cloud github com assets 347712 1459402 2d064738 43d4 11e3 9369 20bb96e4ef3c png  and here is the same output on the ubuntu vm   screen shot 2013 11 02 at 5 45 12 pm  https   f cloud github com assets 347712 1459418 e7b001c2 43d5 11e3 91db 22a8defd79c7 png 
the checker is flake8  i'm on the current tip of master  2d9ff24   by test file  do you mean a python file  or my vimrc  the former is simple  just make any old syntax error  such as an else without a colon   the latter can be found in my dot_files repo  i guess the first step is to try and reproduce it without all my crazy plugins enabled though    i'll try that when i have time 
the current git head  via neobundle     set shellslash    i guess you meant that  says  noshellslash   setting it gives me forward slashes in the error message  but it stays the same 
yes  i saw on your readme that it might suit some people better  so i installed it  unfortunately javascript support seems to have  lulled  https   github com valloric youcompleteme pull 724  until someone else can pick it up  i'll just have to remember to write files every so often and disable my automated stuff 
i would like to try in this weekend 
no i have the following plugins currently installed   i change the virtualenv manually  and on my system  arch linux  python3 is default  so _ usr bin python_ is a symlink to _ usr bin python3_ 
yes  i have them         which gcc  usr bin gcc        which g++  usr bin g++
i have confirmed that this issue does _not_ happen with other plugins installed  so it is most likely something on my part  also  i have found this issue only happens with this set 
jshint
update  i noticed when i  w the file  vim tries to compile the file  i e  there is a  ali and a  o file  but no compilation  when i delete both files gnatmake succeeds  all plugins disabled except vundle  see vimrc here https   gist github com ampoffcom ed5ad53e5422cb54eb37 minimal example here https   gist github com ampoffcom 938df72119a72ad617bf
hi  thanks for the fast reply  i added the following to my  vimrc file  but i'm not using macvim  just normal vim installed through homebrew with  brew install vim     at this point i'm not really sure what i'm doing  sorry to be a pain  any tips i can tryout  thanks again andy  heart   blue_heart   sparkling_heart

i have installed syntastic for vim on previous systems using this version of vi before  the prompt shows every time i open vim 
hi  sorry  it seems that i won't be able to check it if i haven't saved the file yet  which is what the problem was  but then  how do i enable auto checking everytime i open a python script 
the example directive in the original comment is invalid  syntastic won't actually disable the sc2034 check for the line following that line  presumably because there is text trailing the directive  i'm proposing that if there is text trailing a directive line  that it be ignored rather than invalidating the directive  that text is there to explain to future readers why the directive has been put there  for example 
i think that's on the discussion list for v2 of the api  i think the trouble is that some of the states unnecessarily change too many things too often  which would indicate false positives on if modified since  for something like that to work "reliably"  it could mean a diff or checksum between scrapes  which would suck  but hopefully we could see out of the box support for this in well behaved states  but that's all speculation  since i'm not familiar with the backend issues  greg on apr 4  2012  at 10 46 am  paul tagliamonte wrote 
unfortunately  i'm just a consumer of the open states api and noticed the new data wasn't there yet  i do have some coding skills  but it's more in the php and node js realm  was never able to wrap my mind around python  i'll definitely keep an eye on the texas data though and report anything odd i notice once session starts

hi  estaub  i closed the pyopenstate issue and referenced this one instead  the main reason i double posted was that i didn't see any responses there on another issue for a long time  there are no duplicate issues anyone  i followed your instructions and i want to make sure i follow the right protocol  i will respond to the other questions once i get in office on monday  i appreciate your response 
seems the parser stripped the tag i was talking about  if there was any confusion  i was talking about the output tag   p the html5 wd specifies quite detailed the expected behaviour of output  http   dev w3 org html5 spec overview html#the output element   the most important one being the first part of this sentence  "the value idl attribute must act like the element's textcontent idl attribute  except that on setting  in addition  before the child nodes are changed  the element's value mode flag must be set to value  using modernizrs addtest method  i'm testing the first part with the following snippet  modernizr addtest 'output' function    var o   document createelement 'output'   o value   "foo"  return o textcontent    o value     
i just went thru the web build interface  i'm not the only one to see this  i have a small involvement in the drupal project and someone there created an issue to upgrade their version of modernizr to 3 0 and the alpha tag was pointed out there  they are about to release a new version of drupal and they are adverse to releasing it with alpha code  on september 15  2015  at 10 32 am  patrick kettner notifications github com wrote  i'm not able to replicate this  how were you building it   dcrocks  — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
ok  i didn't noticed that modernizr only supports html5  1  i'm not just using the js no js feature  i use touch input type input attributes too  css3 i use where it is unobstrusive 2  i like the fact that xhtml is validated in realtime with the html validator firefox plugin 3  i feel not safe to switch from xhtml to html5 at the moment  because i do not know  how that will change our search engine ranking and the rendering in all browsers  our site has some million page impressions per month and i'm responsible for the code  4  move the classes to the body tag would be backward compatible  so one can use the same doctype but support modern browser features without using html5  as long as the behaviour stays the same  i will use my own detection for js again  adding a class to the body and using modernizr for the rest  that's not perfect  but a solution 
sorry bad markdown  instead of having to do this   pre       if lt ie 7    html class "no js ie6"     endif          if ie 7    html class "no js ie7"     endif          if ie 8    html class "no js ie8"     endif          if  gte ie 9    ie          html class "no js"         endif      pre  could modernizr do it 
i have no idea  i just tried it today  also document implementation hasfeature 'events textinput'  ''  returns false even though the event is supported 
sure thing  you can find it at the below url  it appears that the css zooming enlarging happens in ie8   ie7 in windows xp  and ie7 in windows 7  http   www designerdean com temp layout1 html
i made a placeholder test which works with and without the input test see pull request https   github com modernizr modernizr pull 481

hello  back from holidays    i've not been able to reproduce the bug on jsfiddle  http   jsfiddle net v7tux 1    using external source i've never used before  i'll try something else  later   
thanks for the quick response  i'm using 2 7 1 installed via bower  sha is 54252c10fc7d3b8b17cf458c401ca904dc354d8c  which is odd because the tagged sha is different on this repo  
chrome 32 0 1700 102  not sure the 3 0 pre sha  i'll rebuild tomorrow with latest and check again 
off the modernizr object  actually  not sure the age of this build  on a project somewhat new to me  on friday  july 8  2016  patrick kettner notifications github com wrote  ## rob wierzbowski  robwierzbowski http   twitter com #  robwierzbowski http   github com robwierzbowski http   robwierzbowski com
it actually ended up being an issue with the compatibility being set to ie9  not an issue with modernizr  thanks 
this may have actually been resolved by the update that avoids context creation during the webgl check  this one using an old 1 6 build of modernizr triggers the issue  http   jsfiddle net c55lg 2  this one with 2 7 0 does not trigger it  http   jsfiddle net a7tyf 1  so i guess this may mean this was resolved a long time ago and there are just lots of old versions of modernizr still in use 
hello  no worries  not blaming anyone  i'm not sure if i've coded something wrong  or if the browsers got some problems  i'm not really a fan of android's browsers other than chrome  you can see the issue here www themes tdp demo com autodealer  just visit the website on mobile and you'll be able to see the issue with dolphin browser on android  ps  although that link uses an outdated version of modernizr  i've tested the issue even with the latest version  regards 
i just forked it and added a test   https   rawgit com aaike modernizr master test build_test test html if i check that in ie it throws the error  the build was created by cloning the master branch and simply do the grunt build  without any changes to any files  the error also happens with the unminified file  which is also in the build_test directory 
ah  found it  i missed this  but  supportscontext  was apparently renamed  probablysupportscontext   https   developers whatwg org the canvas element html#dom canvas probablysupportscontext changed in webkit here  https   bugs webkit org show_bug cgi id 120716 interesting that they left in  supportscontext  in other versions of safari but not this one 
so  in v2 8 3 firefox gets "touch" class  in v3 0a firefox gets "touchevents" class
sure  you can use the following  codepen  http   codepen io anon pen mymjov editors 1010 
karma tests adapting to browser features  it is certainly possible to test useragent  but isn't the point of modernizr

hey  dariocravero  thanks for looking into this  i've tried the suggestion to give the jvm more memory  you can cd into a padrino app dir and start padrino like this  jruby  j xmx4096m  s bundle exec padrino start i am getting the same error  i am very skeptical that it's a memory issue  i can run a not entirely trivial rails app on trinidad with the default jruby memory settings  would be a real surprise indeed if an empty padrino app would require more memory than a complete rails stack  besides  the exception thrown is "wrong number of arguments for constructor" does not look like a memory issue  if i had to guess  i'd suspect some inconsistency when creating the application context for tomcat  i can help debug it if i knew how to force padrino to use trinidad  if i run padrino with a debugger attached  it always reverts to webrick  cheers slawo
hey dario  upon further testing it seems that the behavior is dependent on other routes with similar parameters being present  an isolated single route it works fine  but if there's multiple similar routes they seem to be stepping on each others toes  changing the order of the routes as well as get post changes the param behaviour as well  i was testing on jruby 1 7 3   puma i'll try to isolate that issue later today

yup  this is what happened  should have mentioned that  thanks for the response 
here is  gist  https   gist github com 974636   actually it's weakest place of the my app right now  everything mixed together  may i ask you what have led you to this file  also i am on mac 
sure   i could tell is wasn't working because the session cleared every time i restarted the app  even though i set a specific secret  so it seemed that the session secret was still being updated as random on restarts 
thank you for reply  and sorry for my own mistakes  i stupidly disabled the layout in app rb  everything works fine now  thanks

ok  i will test it 
well  here goes 
sure  https   github com sschepens demo you can start the app with  bundle exec pumactl  f puma rb start  to start it with the parameters i use  i'm using https   github com rakyll boom to generate load   boom  n 30000  c 200 http   127 0 0 1 8080 ping  this produces tons of 500s and a few 200s responses  adding this on padrino before_load fixes the issue   i'm having this issue in archlinux and ubuntu 12 04
yes  padrino can create a basic padrino project  after i reinstall 2 3 3 based on rbenv  so it could be caused my specific project  padrino works inside a new project  maybe the problem is package a padrino project as a gem  i will try build again from scratch to see what happened 
please check https   github com krukgit padrino_test tree issue_1880 steps to reproduce  1   git clone git github com krukgit padrino_test git  2   cd padrino_test  3   git checkout issue_1880  4   bundle install   note the  ruby gemset and  ruby version files  5   bundle exec padrino start  6  visit http   localhost 3000 test expected

thanks for getting back to me  i'm using the default driver script generate cucumber   capybara gives me  i'm guessing this is rack  test  can you point me at the vague direction of source code that might be at fault  i checked http   github com brynary rack test and it only seems to be a thin layer over functionality provided by rack  i also uploaded a demo rails application that exposes the issue to http   github com henning koch capybara ssl issue  
use rack test master  the patch is there 
sure  http   gist github com 644807
that worked  thanks  i did not know about that method before 
even though the page is not reloaded  the value of  window location hash  for the interpreter should be changed  it is not  it always remains the same when hitting visit  it's only changed whenever we click on a link 
yeah agreed  just enough to remind them   
capybara  1 0 0  selenium webdriver  2 3 2 
i didn't touch automatic reload  i think i have to use the wait_until in this case  when i do the initial has_no_css  call  the element is actually on the page and it is visible  i would assume that in this case  capybara would just return "false"  the element disappears probably 3 4 seconds after the call  hence i have to wait until it happens  or is that something that should be caught by an implicit wait  i thought this problem was more of a generic race condition between discovering the element  the element disappearing and checking the element's visibility 
i've setup a demo app showing the problem here  https   github com jacobat capybara nested array bug it seems that it's related to having a file field in the form  removing the file field resolves the issue 
 jnicklas  i would be really grateful for any advice on narrowing down this issue  i now had to put an around filter for every spec that uses rack  test and has 2 slashes in visit call  gems

the test doesn't run in different domain  i save the last url in the rails session var  but it should be clean after the reset  method i suppoust    the session var is not a cookie  is a server var   
even if i call  sleep 10  after clicking the link to open the iframe  the event never attaches  it's a really simple page being loaded in the iframe  so it makes no sense that the javascript would take that long to execute  and it runs just fine in firefox when i'm playing around with the app by hand  i can try event delegation over the next day or two to see if that alleviates the problem  i'll reopen this issue if it doesn't

sorry on the late response   yes i am sure i'm running it with the selenium driver  the problem was that i was getting a  where xyz was the route that i was redirecting to  outside of my site  based on the posting in my controller  it was a strange problem  i agree that it could be easier to just check that a redirect is returned from a controller spec but it seems odd that the behavior in capybara would lead to a no route error when clearly the item does a redirect outside of the application  i appreciate you pointing out the have_current_path matcher 
you're right there is no way to tell for sure  i was just suggestion something which i think could work than the simple sleep 0 1 
versions are  capybara  2 7 1  selenium webdriver  2 51 0 
agreed  i am in process of doing just that with jetbrains and will report back when i get a response  the code assist in rubymine  "jump to declaration"  is pointing to these two locations  driver  capybara in capybara rb  driver  capybara in capybara driver node rb  i note that in the first of those  the following lines are being jumped to   i don't know if that's what is throwing rubymine off  i was hesitant to bring this up here because clearly the code works so it's not an issue with capybara  but if others use this ide they might come across this issue 
hi   twalpole ctrl c detection is a great feature  we missed it so much  but i faced this issue when run controller test which contain recaptcha check  https   github com ambethia recaptcha blob v4 10 0 lib recaptcha verify rb  i expected that verify_recaptcha method always return true in test environment  but when rack_env    'development' verify not skipped

we are doing an upgrade on a few of our javascript systems and still use dragula  https   github com bevacqua dragula   turns out that changing to capybara 3 22 had no effect  however toggling to  w3c  false  did the trick for me  if anyone else stumbles on this i found out how to toggle that from here  https   stackoverflow com questions 56452798 how to turn off w3c in chromedriver to address the error unknown command cannot  if you are using a recent rails version you can use this  https   github com rails rails pull 35081 files  twalpole thank you for world record speed responding to this issue request  do you have a recommendation for making this work with w3c set to true  it seems like that would be the optimal thing to do now that the defaults have changed

we have a style enforcement tool  cstyle pl  located in github com illumos illumos gate usr src tools scripts   that we have used for a  long  time  decades actually  though for the first part of its life that was inside sun   it demands that #define be followed by a  tab  — its a stupid rule imo  but there you go  anyway  for this code base  which has hundreds of developers — we can’t use uncrustify unless we can make uncrustify produce cstyle pl conformant code  you could argue that we could just “fix cstyle”  but the problem with that is that it is been in use by so many for so long  that changing the coding style in even trivial ways like this becomes a political morass  so that it’s easier to just not use uncrustify than to debate about the style   after all we’ve done without uncrustify for this long…  on fri  dec 23  2016 at 8 10 am  gmaurel  notifications github com  wrote

using any of the three options you provided did not change the output to the desired format  note that this is most likely a bug because the newline is added by setting  nl_var_def_blk_start  to 2 even though it is described as  clearly the function is not a variable definition but it is treated as such 
i do the following  import nltk   ntlk download    then i try downloading the packages of choices  when i try scrolling down or up i see the unicodedecodeerror  this happens with scrolling up and down in all packages tab   unicodedecodeerror  'utf 8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0  invalid start byte 
i have read through the code after submitting the issue  the most probable cause is because nltk's algorithm searches only for path of the form     meaning going to root and back   and my algorithm can find path of the form         etc   because it's just a simple dfs   first sentence of the documentation says that "returns the distance of the shortest path linking the two synsets  if one exists  " and that does not qualify on the shape of the path  even if there is a description of the algorithm below   in the example it happens that dog is a domestic animal  but cat is not  however  some special cats called domestic cats are domestic animals  so the path has the shape dog   domestic animal   domestic cat   cat  knowing what i know now  after reading the algorithm's code  i am not sure i would post the issue here  still naming shortest_path_distance an entirely different algorithm  which in fact probably runs faster and can sometimes be a substitute for the real shortest path  makes me fell uneasy    one shouldn't do that  it is not my choice what to do with it  maybe the majority of nltk users do want present version   i can only voice my concerns  for those that are careless enough that they do not read the algorithm's code before using it   and this is what i am doing right now  and i dodged the issue and moved on long time ago  so my concerns are only superficial

sorry  i forgot to update this  i was able to finally get it to work  i think the problem was my high latency satelite internet connection was probably conflicting with an aggressive connection timeout or somthing similiar on the download server  after network conditions improved  i was able to download the data    thanks

i'm using ironpython 2 7 7  which according to ironpython net downloads is the latest stable version  and i still see 'cli'   i also installed ironpython  version 2 7 5  on arch linux and see 'cli' output for sys platform  i imagine the ironpython authors intend sys platform to be consistent for ironpython across every os  the python docs on sys platform don't really enlighten me as to whether that's the right thing to do

the input to the corenlppostagger tag is    'the'  ' '  'boy'  ' '  'walks'  ' '  'well'  ' '   the output is     u'the'  u'dt'    u'boy'  u'nn'    u'walks'  u'vbz'    u'well'  u'rb'    u' '  u' '    so the length of the input differs from the length of the output  the spaces tokens are ignored  i think it's better programming to keep the lengths the same  because it allows easier correlation between an input element to output element 
till now i have not seen the error come up for larger dataset  thanks

i tried this again at home and i got nn for both python2 and 3  using nltk 3 4 5  at work i _was_ able to reproduce the nn nnp problem  but that was on nltk 3 0 3  fwiw   it does seem that the same problem exists with  classifierbasedpostagger  in 3 4 5  but that  pos_tag  uses that class in older versions but not in newer versions  since i can't seem to reproduce this error in 3 4 5  i think the issue is closed  however  if you know of a place in the nltk code that still uses the  classifierbasedpostagger   this bug may still exist  just fyi on the re change though

 val  does need to be coerced to a string  granted this will look weird if the original object had array or hash values  but i don't think there's any way around that  likewise  i don't see any problem with  null  and  undefined  being keys  there isn't really a way to get an unambiguous string descriptor for a javascript entity  and even if there were  it would make the inverse hash overly cumbersome to use  for that reason   _ inverse  can't be used for  _ uniq   it would generate false positives because of the string coercion  e g   _ uniq  1  '1'   should be a no op  with inverse  it would be reduced  
 samuelclay  either   true items    false items   or  the hash as dvv mentioned  hash is more general purpose 
fair enough  and as  spadgos mentioned you can always use  bind   it just feels     it feels like  delay    defer  and their sibling functions were all rushed out without the same consideration given to most of underscore  and as soon as the userbase had a chance to say "wait a minute" the response from the underscore team was "sorry  it's too late to change"   yes i know those functions aren't super new  but this also isn't the first ticket on this issue   changing a library is never good  but making a library more like the php standard library  ie  fragmented  over time is  imho  worse  you don't want function a working one way and similar function b working a totally different way  you want the two to be consistent so users don't have to think  before defer  and the other function modifier functions that came out at around the same time  like memoize and delay  every underscore function that took a function as an argument also took an optional context argument  users didn't have to go to the docs to remember how a function worked  they just knew  then the defer "crop" of functions came out  and suddenly consistency went out the window  now we have the original standard set of function taking functions  and we have the new ghetto set that require ugly workarounds to use  you have to deal with the fallout of a backwards compatibility change and i don't  so i certainly will understand if you don't buy my argument  however  i had to at least take a shot at  gently  suggesting that     well that keeping the same wonderful consistency between functions that underscore used to have will truly benefit the library as a whole 
 knowtheory you are fast  ook 
 jdalton afaik underscore does not have a  curry  function  if you're referring to lo dash curry  or http   fitzgen github io wu js #wu autocurry  this is similar  but  in my opinion more clear and powerful  if you try the last example i gave  _ each  with those functions you'll have to choose the arity initially  because the context is an optional argument to _ each   let me know if i'm missing something or was not clear 
i don't need to include templates into build file  it should load dynamically  or you just wanna look to precompiled code

yes  all components use zmq 2 0 7  and segfaulting on malformed messages is generally bad in any case  and possibly a security risk in some environments  
no  because   that requires compilation  i'm talking about a step  before  compilation   that doesn't tell me what cflags it was built with  or what extensions  such as pgm  were compiled with zeromq 
i'll get a backtrace on monday in the office again  but i believe that in the zmq_engine in_event   function disconnection can become true + we can be in the unplugged state  it seems like a legal state and that will cause error   to be called in an unplugged state
i was talking about 2 0 version  both ubuntu and fedora ship 2 0 version of zeromq  so  you are telling that so 0 0 0 is normal for 2 0 version of zeromq 
not easily since i'm using clrzmq2 binding to c# with a release build of libzmq  is there a sample c program i could easily compile and test out the bind and connect calls with epgm 
zmq built from the v4 0 1 tag  sorry meant to say that 
it already checks the return value  assert  rc    0   assert  zmq_errno       0   it's just the second assert that fails

well  for example  i am trying to do a static build against zmq  ldflags " all static"   the packages distributed in ubuntu debian are compiled against libsodium and libpgm  assuming i installed those packages with aptitude  when i run  pkg_check_modules  libzmq    it should tell me that i have to link with  lsodium and  lpgm  in the end   ar  should make one statically linked binary  for my project  that not only include objects from libzmq a  but also from libsodium a and libpgm a  right

hi  thanks for the response  i am unable to produce a minimal test case as it's not obvious which condition is triggering this failed assertion  it is happening in my unit tests  although i believe that issue may have also occurred in non unit test scenarios too   i am running on centos 7 2 vm on virtual box  the difference between unit test and non unit test execution of these code paths is the protocol  ipc for former  epgm tcp for latter  in both scenarios there are also inproc sockets involved 
well  i don't have the server code  so i compile zmq with static lib in my dll project  the version is the latest  in my code with developing zmq  there are only sever lines  i only use connect function now  but with a new server version  it works well  we still have to develop the plugin with the older server version  ctx   zmq_init 1   if   ctx    return    s   zmq_socket ctx  zmq_pub   if   s    return    rc   zmq_connect s  "tcp   127 0 0 1 8002"   if  rc    0    return

 bluca  many thanks for the responses until now  we will definitely try to use the zmq_reconnect_ivl  although i'm unsure if we can via the c++ wrapper interface  we're indeed using the c++ wrapper interface and the zmq  socket_t object goes out of scope triggering the zmq  close  we're using the  shared queue dealer and router sockets  http   zguide zeromq org page all#shared queue dealer and router sockets  when we do use the dealer router sockets and also initialize the zmq_proxy we experience slightly different behavior  the first 1000 socket_t objects that go out of scope are destroyed as expected by the reaper thread  the socket queue is only filled with 3 sockets and the empty_slots queue is filled with 1021 items  beyond the usage of 1000 socket_t the reaper thread doesn't destroy the sockets anymore  why is unclear for me   when debugging we see the socket queue grow and the empty_slots queue size reduce  when the empty_slots queue is empty  the zmq  error_t is thrown  to revive the behavior of zmq we need to restart the application completely which is of course unacceptable  please comment 
hi  i don't have any experience with autoconf  the only place where i found suitable to put such condition is autoconf file  but it used to generate configure script only  so it won't be executed during compilation on user's computer 
if you are connected on a dns for instance  connecting multiple times to the same endpoint will cycle through the load balancer  see #2297   as for the expected result i think silently ignoring the connect call if it resolves to a already connected endpoint would make more sense

if i understood the question  my  bin sh is a symbolic link to  bin bash
there is no code reading from the monitor socket  the sole existence of the monitor socket seems to cause the issue  i honestly do not know  i am by no means an expert on this topic  is it going to be filled up in the case of a disconnected socket on the other end

it does pass with rspec 1 rails 2  i am not sure what you mean by type  code assigns  users  inspect  code   it does nothing unless i do  code puts assigns  users  inspect  code   then it just spits out the array of objects    if i check the class in the controller e g   code puts  users class  code  i get willpaginate  collection  doing  code puts assigns  users  class  code  in the spec i get array

well  it can be just a new project with mongoid added to the gemfile  that's all  test prepare won't be run  is it really required to show you a repo example 
yea  i'm seeing it happen with testunit as well   maybe i should take this up with rails  but do you see this being a problem  or are they going to just chuck it up to ruby

i am using rspec rails  2 12 2   the problem doesn't occur 
 alindeman i do tonight  so i'll see what i can put together 
 samphippen thank you for your feedback  what is the intention of
basically trying to do this  https   github com plataformatec devise wiki how to  stub authentication in controller specs where i can stub the user as being logged in  works fine in 2 14  but doesnt' work in 3 0 0 beta series 
 alindeman  i have even updated shoulda to  2 1 0  but i am still getting the same error  ps sorry for delay  i was on vacation   edit i have added new issue at shoulda matchers  https   github com thoughtbot shoulda matchers issues 293
 alindeman thanks for your reply  i think it coused by inherited_resources   when i don't use inherited_resources  works well  thanks 
oh my god  never mind this issue  i am retard  i totally understand the convention  but i forgot about it when i run my test 
i pushed it to http    github com eduncan26 social_news_site
rails 4 0 9 rspec rails 3 0 2 ruby 2 1 2 p95 capybara 2 4 1 i also just tried rspec rails 3 1 0 with the same results  thanks for looking into it 
ah  you just knocked a memory loose  i have seen this before  you're right  the error is from the controller  if i change this line  that fixes the error  looks like a rails bug to me 
for features  i always generate them independently  so i run  g rspec feature  
 cupakromer yes it is happen in spec only 
waiting for https   github com rails rails pull 23211 to be merged before i start investigating 
when i change that line in the reproduction steps above i get the same result 
no problem  like i said controller specs are fine  merely raising the gap in functionality 
 benoittgt i would give it a try    
your right  meant to file this on rspec rails  sorry 
 jonrowe  pirj i've updated the error and files above  those were from a different branch where i tried to implement rspec  sorry for the confusion 
the pr from  eugeneius pointed me towards the problem  my spec was this 
  image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2105258 44847214 5bb98680 ac70 11e8 9593 d5aa958bd331 png  the text  for some column  is not readable when i open same csv file in google docs though  i was thinking to insert into db as it is 
yes  i am using writerecord  so that must be it 
i have to write  when mapped i i want that the same propery are mapped in two different csv property  so i can split this property in two with different typeconverter 
hi josh  actually it does  for some reason i hadn't seen the overload  probably because i'd been using the generic mainly   maybe a little improvement on the documentation side might help instead 
nope  it appears this csv doesn't quote anything at all  don't know what it looks like when confronted with the delimiter in a field   
it's not a dependency for  net framework 4 5  which is what would be used if csvhelper is added to a  net 4 6 1 project  it's listed as a dependency of  net standard 1 3  perhaps the issue is here  https   github com joshclose csvhelper blob 815aa6b1a647e56e00c87a1c48a949b906a09423 src csvhelper corefxcompatibility typeextensions cs it seems that that file is compiled into the project if  net_4_5  perhaps that check should only be for  corefx  because if corefx then the system reflection typeextensions dependency is used   
we've got a piece of code which allows various configurations in the same library  we need to add another configuration with the flattening behaviour  so not really    
i've tested it with 2 14 2   
i export lists of either mybasetype or myderivedtype as csv files depending on the user's export settings  essentially both types are rows in exportable reports  with myderviedtype having extra details if required  i register the maps and csvwriter at application startup using dependency injection  so at report export time both maps have already been registered 
in my opinion empty string should be also null  empty string is "better" than null   parsed text should never return null by default  ps i know that it is not big issue   changing current approach can be done in few lines 
 joshclose
no  say for example i have mappers  and i want the csv reader to use those mapping classes every time i use the parser  i would have to pass the config around which makes it more difficult  ideally you would call config once during start up or something  set up the configuration then every time csvreader is instantiated that configuration would be injected into it or something like that  on mon  jul 24  2017 at 8 06 pm  josh close  notifications github com  wrote 
when writing csv file  if i open file in notepad or other editor it looks "true" while open in excel it shows as "true"  no additional configuration  is any configuration to set column type general to text in csv excel  because it default behavior of excel to convert "true" to "true" my requirement is to generate csv  modify some data and based on text comparison   update on database  but due to "true" to "true" comparison get failed so that record not get updated
exactly  this should result in 123 ignoring the floating point
hi josh  here's a simple test  testmethod  public void shoulduseconstructorparameterstruetest     var definition   new   id   0  name   string empty     using  var stream   new memorystream    using  var writer   new streamwriter stream   using  var reader   new streamreader stream   using  var csv   new csvreader reader     writer writeline "1 one"   writer flush    stream position   0  csv configuration hasheaderrecord   false  csv configuration shoulduseconstructorparameters   type    true  var records   csv getrecords definition  tolist       
hi josh thank you for the response  the definition is as follows   i made all the other fields to be string coz i'm not using them for any calculations 
sorry  i'm kinda new to c#  only 8 days programming   how do i make myexception inner to validationexception  
  it is always empty  i am trying with a sample csv with several date errors  the errors are replaced with the default correctly but gmap g_errorparsing has no elements  i also tried with this 
josh  thanks for the quick response  it was a rookie mistake of mine  i am using your package with https   github com filipw dotnet script and i forgot the reference before accessing the package

now is ok
bumping up png in priority helped with making the previews in copyq transparent  i didn't know i could check the mimetypes of the items with f4 until now  i'll be sure to keep that in mind any time i end up finding funky stuff in previews  on 05 05 2013 01 26 am  lukas holecek wrote

i'm on archlinux  i have this problem almost everywhere  in fact  in this textarea where i wrote this comment  there is not problem  but i've got the probleme elsewhere 
i meant "keyboard around" and have fixed above  i'm not sure what the  menu  key is  but  alt+i  doesn't do anything for me on mac 
i have a 'clear clipboard ini' file which i downloaded from here i think  loaded into 'commands   global shortcuts'  we've communicated on this one before   it wasn't working prior to 2 4 4  then you fixed it and now it's broken again 
i'll give it a go  thanks 
i'm using ubuntu 14 04  and i generally will try to start it within the xsession startup process  the goal is to have it start with my bspwm window manager  and show itself  it starts up fine  but copyq  s  session name  show fails 
hmmm  nothing changed  only rebooted after another day in office  and now after spending half day in kde5 the icon still looks good    copyq1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1481680 9036953 b228fe9c 39e6 11e5 8a1c c484bc068f17 png  so i close this one and will reopen it when the problem occurs again  installed copyq with the rpm file 
unfortunately i don't have any logs and this error in the logs "failed to set binary stdin" was the only error every time i terminate and start cq i got this error repeated 4 times at every start i'm very sure the app did had write permissions to all it's folders i don't have this problem anymore  reinstalled windows   and i can't reproduce it u can close this issue  i think its a very rare situation as i'm using cq from a very long time and that was the first time to face such a problem 
sorry  i was not clear enough  i am pasting commands to linux terminal  so the first enter selects and pastes the command to my terminal and the second one executes the pasted command  i get double paste instead in 3 3 x versions unless i deliberately wait  i do not have to wait too long  but just long enough for it to be seriously slowing me down  and i of course keep forgetting to do so  so i am always double pasting     configs attached   copyq conf zip  https   github com hluk copyq files 1935943 copyq conf zip

sorry for the late reply  i don't know what i did but it's showing in the tray now  maybe it was the last system update i did 
not only "large"  so i tried some tests  10 cells works fine  at 12  the app simply crashes  same for 15  20 etc  at some point after that intermediate phase  its doesn't crash  50ish+ at least   but starts the flashing behavior which goes on  seemingly  indefinitely until i kill the process  i suspect there is more going on here than it simply needing time to 'gonculate' lots of data 
yes  i checked it before posting  i updated today because i was using one of the earlier versions  where pinning didn't work  since you say that a similar bug was fixed  i'm going to uninstall it and install again  maybe it's because i updated  i hope i don't have to purge my config though  reconfiguring all my settings would be a bother 
still getting this tiny text  http   imgur com a 2r71y can't read anything at a normal distance
 hluk can't open v3 7 2 from tray  the server is started  because i can see the copyq process  but can't see the ui   the log file   local share copyq copyq copyq log  contains nothing 
i've tried with the same version  but i'm not having any luck  when i do the import  i only see the one tab  clipboard   the  cpq file appears to have all the tabs in it  but it's a binary file  so i don't know for sure what is in it  i'm not going to worry about it because i can recreate the tabs  but i had a bunch of commands that are now lost  oh well  i can rewrite those also  rich
it's the latest version  this only happens if you move an image from the clipboard hsitory into the clipboard  if you copy an image and it is already in the clipboard  it will paste properly    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 25157703 74069790 3dab9600 49cd 11ea 8e3f d6ddf8fddae1 png 
i use "move to trash" and "undo delete"
oh  sorry  forgot it  windows 10  copyq ver 3 7 1  ok  i will now first install version 3 7 3 and will report later    srry  you can delete this issue 
hi  fedora 26  64 bit  happens both with the latest package that comes with fedora  copyq 3 1 2 1 fc26 x86_64  and the release 3 2 0 that is available on https   github com hluk copyq releases for fedora  desktop is cinnamon  didn't test with other environments  as said  if i map the global shortcut to the main window it works correctly when invoked and closed  the problem is if i map the global shortcut to invoke the tray icon menu  best regards 
 scottkosty sorry for that  system version  macos 10 14 2 copyq version  3 7 1 here is a demo    screen recording 2018 12 26 at 2 22 07 pm  https   user images githubusercontent com 8088354 50434890 16554f00 091a 11e9 941a 72026ed18029 gif 
it still persists for me in 3 3 1 
hi  flag is checked but i have 2 5 0 installed from ubuntu 16 repo    do i need to build to get the latest  
what i initially did after discovering the issue was to delete all of the entries under the clipboard tab and that seemed to help fix it  i went to uninstall it just now and discovered that even though the copyq was not showing up in the systray there were 2 copyq processes were running  i terminated them and uninstalled copyq and reinstalled it into the same directory  will see how it behaves after this process 
i have 3 5 0  i installed it from the ubuntu software window 
yes  copyq_3 6 1_debian_9 0 1_amd64 deb  installed  as root  with gdebi  copyq clipboard manager v3 6 0 qt  5 7 1 compiler  gcc arch  x86_64 little_endian lp64 os  devuan gnu linux ascii  usr local bin copyq however  synaptic reports v 3 6 1 1

the tab in this test was normal tab without encryption and without synchronization on the disk  i build successfully copy q from master  also sudo make intall seems run as should  but i still get v 3 7 1 while running copyq from console 
1  i use deepin screenshot tool to screenshot 2  and then the picture is inside my clipboard also inside copyq  because i can see that in copy item list  3  and then i copy text  but not use picture in clipboard  4  after i paste the text  i move from the picture in the copy to the clipboard  but the picture can not paste 
solved in addition to the following configuration：  restart the fcitx input tool and copyq after installation  then try chinese input  success 
today copyq will not start  i would like to use it  i remove copyq from pc  fedora 31 beta  and install new  try to open copyq  click on icon and nothing happens  type copyq in terminal message  warning  copyq server is already running  gui of copyq opens when i type  copyq show  in terminal it says  0  empty i copy a text  select and ctrl c  after that in gui of copyq i open show clipboard content  a new window opens  without any content 
thanks  yuvmel and  hluk for pointing into the right direction  also in mojave 10 14 it is possible to remove and add copyq again in the macos system preferences  for the german audience  systemeinstellungen  sicherheit  datenschutz  bedienungshilfen  to reactivate the expected behaviour  and checking the faq link and especially #1030 helped a lot to better understand my issue  what i didn't tell at first  just a few weeks ago i switched from traditional drag and drop to homebrew  v3 11 0 was the first copyq version to be updated by homebrew  in addition to this  i work with different accounts   admin account installs updates via homebrew and daily account just uses the apps  cannot remember if macos asked me to allow accessibility     might homebrew and or admin account have an impact on my version of this issue  again thanks a lot  and i just documented it a little bit longer here for future reference   you never know     
latest from git  i just move file from hidden directory in  home to  etc as root and after i quit one cpu is loaded on 100 
it returns the same error 
yes  kitty's colorscheme isn't inherited versions  1 9 1 i haven't set that parameter in my rc conf  i tried setting it for versions  1 9 1 but that didn't have any effect 
yes   never knew that the macos filesystem  apfs  was case insensitive by default  but apparently it is  i don't know ranger's internals so i don't know how best to address the problem  but it seems clear that this is a bug since  testdir  and  testdir  remain different values in many contexts  e g  display   if not for the purposes of file comparison  the solution you propose sounds good   the redundant moves renames problem could be avoided by doing a python based  i e  case sensitive  comparison of the existing filename and the supplied new name 
that's what the second entry is about  latest is tested 
i attached a tarball with three files in it  if you open them in ranger and move from one to the other you may be able to see it  one of the files  the one with "objects" in its name  has a few red lines in the beginning  when going to another file then back  there will be garbage after the red text  left from the previous file  what's the program you are using for preview generation  maybe it can be patched to generate preview of ansi glyphs too 
here is my setup  os  arch linux x86_64 python 3 4 3 ranger 1 6 1  stable 
the only issue i can see is with ctrl+o binding  i am not sure if it is common that installed application is changing my key bindings 
 vifon just listed my pictures directory  i'm use w3mimgdisplay for pictures previews  if it's important 
 nfnty it happens when i launch it via an application launcher  using the  desktop file   i suspect this is nothing to do with ranger and instead everything to do with my wm  awesome   launched via a gnome session  and   or gnome  i'm posting in case anyone has a solution  a real one  not my hack      any idea how a desktop environment determines  or is supposed to determine  what is the default terminal application  and if there's a way to change it 
not 100  sure what would make most sense  but next prev would probably be desired  marking would make sense in some cases  on mon  aug 6  2018 at 6 48 pm  toon nolten  notifications github com  wrote

yah i get what you're saying  i've been playing around with the idea of having a separate script  but it would be more convenient and cleaner overall to have it built in  also  could you elaborate on what you mean by remote code execution  i'm also curious about the best way to handle installing different plugins  since it seems like you would need some sort of spec  i guess you could do one of    require plugins to have a makefile with an install and uninstall command   copy over all  py files in the root of the repo   have a plugin folder in the repo with all plugin files   require a text file in the plugin repo listing all the files that should be copied over that might be something to standardize and include in the wiki idk 
i removed compton and now it's working fine  instead of transparency there is a black background  ignoring the terminal's color  but i think it's inevitable  right 
1 9 1 i've updated ranger to 1 9 1 a month ago 
 vifon w3m w3mimgdisplay
yeah  after posting this i found the ranger git package in aur and i installed it  now it works perfect  but i'll wait for the next update for the regular package in the arch repos  thank you for your instant reply   
i tested this with jpeg and png  i can't make more test right now  only tomorrow 
 toonn yes  it's definitely not a big deal for me to just open it from  r   just thought i might've missed an option   seebye i see that is the case  disabling daemon mode fixes the issue  is it possible to work ueberzug with the urxvt daemon  or is it not possible  if not  i'll have to switch back to w3m

this doesn't happen in xterm  so it's something to do with alacritty handling the mouse on linux  mouse interactions seem to work in vim though  should i file a bug against alacritty as well  on sun  mar 24  2019  2 47 pm toon nolten  notifications github com  wrote 
yes the old version of commands py was the issue  thanks 
will do  the errors don't seem to be consistent across languages  rmarkdown files will often crash  as well as python  javascript  and bash files  but they will also render just fine at other times  it does crash more often when looking at files with non latin characters 
i fixed the issue that way  i brought the issue up because it's tricky and hard for user to figure what went wrong without debugging the code  i don't know how the file was created  it seems that the only correct way to fix the issue is to move the  path_compat  related code from  fm datapath    to  main py parse_argunents     like the following  if user specified   datadir  then use it as datadir  elif there is file like copy_buffer  etc under configdir  then use configdir as datadir  else use datadir default value fi not sure if it's worth the effort though  feel free to close the issue 
of course they match  it happens "accidentally"  similar to the behaviour of deleting files when you turn off set_confirm_on_delete  usually when i press arrow right at a normal text file i'll get the editor loading the file most of the time  and sometimes it's a  sh file which gets executed without an additional confirmation  so it works like expected  thats why i am asking for "set_confirm_on_execution" am so   9  juni 2019 um 17 06 uhr schrieb toon nolten   notifications github com  
 genkobar nope  installed via homebrew it's just messed up after update to macos catalina  and maybe i did iterm2 update 
just compiled v1 9 3 and get the same crash as above  also  "open_with" key 'r'  no longer works 
yes  it does 
sorry  it magically worked fine like three days after i wrote this issue  i didn't know why and what i've done  but it works fine now  thank you 
yep  its repeatable  i test with urxvt terminal and en_en utf 8   no changes  i don't know if python problem    
running authorize_port_range with  excon_debug true 
thanks for fixing this 
the use case is using multiple tools  one after the other  to perform a complex task  the shell is where that is done  having to go into fog's interactive mode is great when one needs to do multiple fog steps in a row  but not as useful when one needs to do one thing with fog  then another thing with ssh  then another thing with knife  then another thing with vagrant  then another thing with git  one might need to do that kind of a workflow manually in the shell  or one might need to write a shell script that does that kind of a workflow  of course the reason fog exists is for its ruby api  but a cli layered on top of that  generated at runtime from introspection on the models  would help with this alternative type of use case  one which makes use of multiple tools and only does one thing with each of them 
i'm able to run put_object and delete_object without error so it looks like it's unique to the directories method  and excon seems to work fine when used by itself  https   gist github com 977486

i'm not sure what you mean by pass in a hash  here is some code to illustrate the issue more clearly  this is what happens with the current code when getting a server   the db_security_groups attribute can be left as is  so users have access to the array of hashes 
updated the first paragraph of my comment  i think the problem is that even setting  name  as a variable with a default value still won't help   since the developer using fog may not know what the admin in openstack named the networks  patch is forthcoming

not that i have any objection to doing the work but looking through that part of the code makes me think that it's a bit beyond my pay grade  i e  i have like zero direct experience working with excon  i can take a stab at it but i probably won't be able to work on it until mid june  too much stuff  and a vacation  planned between now and then

that sounds like a good and simple solution to my problem  if the host is amazon  then one could have some reasonable expectations about the possible regions  i'll work up a patch based on that  at a later point  one could work with a cache per host  which is pre filled with the currently known ones  so  the impact on the currently known regions would be zero 
yes i would

good thinking  i just tried it  it's the same behavior  i have to cgi encode from the test in order to not have special symbols  ' '  probably ' ' too  mess up the route matching  and  the data is still encoded in may controllers  params  hash  so it's not an rspec problem  closing this ticket  might it be a rails bug  am i missing something obvious 
 alindeman that's a good idea  thanks 
ah ok thanks  if i can muster up a patch do you think you'd be interested  i wouldn't want any existing behavior to change at all  just add the ability to extend classes  i don't mind needing to mix in modules like requestgroup or whatever from there   on jul 16  2011  at 10 55 am  dchelimsky reply reply github com wrote 
i wish i knew that sooner  thinking about rspec like a "database" really helps  for a ci  yes  for a development workflow  it can be really annoying  and for me  "alphabetical" is pretty much the same as "deterministically random" anyway  i agree users shouldn't attempt to order tests  except for workflow convenience  you can change the order using an ordering strategy  though many use cases just need "temporary storting"  i mean that 3 5 files need to be tested in some order when making changes across files  once that works  that order is never again needed  so using it as a configuration option doesn't make sense  since that order isn't something you'd commit into a repository  basically yes  unless running multiple rspec processes is recommended instead  via commandline or via multiple runners through configuration   thanks for the explanation   i'm definitely going to need it  recursion is a bit of a surprise  but it makes sense because it fits into how things are processed  it explains the sorting calls as well  that's interesting  i was rather convinced it had something to do with shell argument expansion  e g  if i pass files in a given order  i expect that order to be respected  even if the files in the dirs  e g   spec   are then randomized  so i'd expect something like   this way you keep consistency stays within the argument directory instead of being global across all files found  i'm not sure about distinguishing between user supplied arguments and e g  configuration  an array of files dirs should be preserved i think  yes  absolutely  that would help a lot  because randomizing pretty much gets in the way if the user supplies custom paths  if i run the full tests  expecting them to pass  i don't care whether the order is random or not  so random order is useful when full suite is run   i'm guessing a lot of users are expecting custom supplied arguments to be honored with their order  especially if failures are expected 
 dchelimsky i'm wanting to use spec integration instead of spec requests for the directory name  you mentioned that to sarah allen to use the following   however  when i generate a new request spec  it's creating the file within the requests directory  it's not too important but i'm trying to keep a consistent terminology with what i'm doing and how it's represented within the directory structure  next  what's the proper way to define the factories path  lastly  thanks for the links because this has cleared up my understanding of using the config include 
for later two options  the spec ran fine  see below   i know executing tests with relative path  however  for my case  my program execute specs using absolute path   thanks for prompt response

hi  samphippen  here is my rails model  https   gist github com arefaslani 5407496 here is my test file  https   gist github com arefaslani 5411508 ruby version  1 9 3p374 rails version  3 2 12 rspec version  2 13 0 error message  https   gist github com arefaslani 5411539
 cupakromer exactly  i expect the global rspec configure before hook to b executed before the mixed in shared context' one  therefore the instance variable being set   when i include the shared context in a nested describe block  it works as expected  but when i include it in the outer most describe block  it doesn't  i just tested the thing again using  include_context  and it works  so it has to be an issue with including shared contexts using metadata matching 
this repo contains a sample that consistently fails the included cucumber feature for me  the feature records the output from the first rspec run and checks it against a second run  https   bitbucket org toadjamb ruby rspec randomization example assuming the cucumber features fail for others  there is a third option that i like better than either of the two i mentioned above  it would be to implement the first option above  but provide a seed regardless so that randomization can be reproduced for a given test run  regardless of whether the specs are run in a random order   this is a potential problem regardless of the ordering strategy 
i was thinking the same thing at first  but the problem is that reloading config is difficult and one point of running in a single process is to only have to load configuration once in the beginning  it is the same idea as being able to start a webserver but still edit code and see changes in real time without restarting it   is there a reason rspec's static configuration  everything set in rspec configure  can't be left untouched during a reset  for more insight into why reloading config is hard  here is how our configuration  relevant to rspec  is structured  spec spec_helper_common rb   all tests use this  sets formatting options and includes dsls like capybara and factory_girl  spec spec_helper rb   settings for unit tests  requires spec_helper_common rb spec integration_spec_helper rb   settings for integration tests  requires spec_helper_common rb spec front_end_spec_helper rb   settings for selenium tests  requires spec_helper_common rb now say we want to reload configuration for unit tests  obviously requiring spec_helper doesn't work since it was already loaded in this process  loading it doesn't work either because that won't load spec_helper_common since it was required earlier  so we could load both of them  but now we've hardcoded a loading order  and we'd have to have separate cases for the integration and front_end configs  which were already properly handled at process startup  also  some things in the config  unrelated to rspec  don't play nice when they are loaded multiple times  an alternative  which was taken by rspec console  is to proxy the rspec configuration object and remember everything that was done to it so it can replay that configuration after a reset  this was broken by the removal of rspec configuration   which was needed to set the configuration to the proxy object  in my opinion  this was a hack that would be solved by not wiping the rspec configuration in the first place 
 myronmarston thanks  i was able to get it sorted out with your advice 
 jonrowe yeah  we're using capybara with selenium  though these are controller specs  which shouldn't be touched by capybara  i tried it out in another application with the same rspec version and it works as expected  so i'll see if i can narrow down the issue  it's odd because i wouldn't expect a cause to be displayed at all here  since no error was raised   
ok  now i think i got it  in your "expanded" example  the first one  when  it  blocks are actually executed they both refer to latest  let  collection   declaration thus the issue happens  for your proposal  let  warn would be great  it could be a source of nasty issues as in this case  however i don't know rspec internals and i think i won't be able to code that  for the pr about missing doc if you tell me where is appropriate to do that i'try to submit a pr 
a few things come to mind immediately    overall  i find this a bit more "user friendly"  the points below will expand on that   it's not obvious what  extend  and  include  do  something more dsl like could clarify that   defining modules for support files pollutes the global namespace  i've had clashes occur when working in teams  plus i don't think i've ever called a module from outside of a single support file   ideally rspec could define these modules and tuck them away somewhere we're they'd still be accessible   global support helpers are a bit cumbersome to write since you need to write a line for both  include  and  extend    there's a lot of repetition when the above pattern  see module controllersupport  is repeated a few times across different spec metadata  e g  models  controllers  views  features   this gets worse if you divide up support files for a spec type across several modules  e g  auth_support  current_user_support  job_support    there's unnecessary connascence between the module name and the include extend call  any modification to the module name would require two or more changes
thanks for leading me in the right direction  apparently created a  rspec file in my root that had my nerdtree menu pasted into it  thats what i get for trying to learn vim   deleted the  rspec and everything works again 
thanks  jonrowe  too bad ruby doesn't have private classes  vendoring could create other trouble  i've not had good luck with it in the past   maintenance headaches   myronmarston   thanks for the offer  i'm not sure what the design choices were for this that necessitated the monkeypatching  i'll ask the project maintainer to pitch in here 
the file gets created  but nothing gets written to it  i'll attach a tiny project archive  it has a  rspec file  so you can just run   rspecproblem zip  https   github com rspec rspec core files 187179 rspecproblem zip 
 myronmarston reproducer here  https   github com imtayadeway rspec_autoloading_issue  i'm also happy to dig more into this myself  just haven't yet in case you  definitely  didn't want rspec to deal with this  just let me know 
 myronmarston great questions  i probably should have included some solutions that would make this clearer  i think maybe it could be as simple as  3 example  0 failures  1 hook error  or something similar  just to make it abundantly clear that you exited with code  1  for a reason  in a related note  do you have any documentation on how to dynamically add test cases  i could probably work with  bogus  to convert their usage of  after  suite   to a dynamic set of tests cases so that you would actually see explicit failures 
really  that explains it  yeah  things are a bit nuts at the moment but i'll try to find some time next month to have a look at it 
this is my custom formatter  i am able to print the value in custom formatter as shown below but i am not able to access the value from statusformatter class and use it in after  suite  method   here i want the status and number of failures inside after  suite  method  please help me and let me know if still needed any details

 maskit all browsers got same issue  http1 1 is work fine  sometimes chrome can switch to proto h2  but most of time it just work in http1 1  
i would say it's a software bug because it is completly unusual to put generic things  after  specific overrides
no i run it all time since the "ab  c 50  n 100000  k" https issue don#t seem to be that relevant in real life but it's anyways bad and had to downgrade from 8 0 2 to 8 0 1 because  this  issue is not acceptable in production
8 0 1 since all follow up vesion are crashing randomly  https   github com apache trafficserver issues 4921    dunno when this started  i just realized it randomly when calling curl without https

sure  it's very simple as i'm just trying to learn ats  basically i have ats running on port 8080 and then i have authentication service running on 8081 and my backend service on 8082
set the client read timeout from 500ms to 2s ，the problem resovled。thanks for your attention。
 ssl_get_peer_certificate  only returns the certificate after the handshake is successfully completed  since  ts_ssl_verify_server_hook  happens during handshake  you can't get the certificate yet  for example  i have a program that hooks to both  ts_ssl_verify_server_hook  and  ts_http_read_response_hdr_hook    ssl_get_peer_certificate ssl   already returns null in the first hook  but gives me server certificate in the second hook  regarding the suggestion to use ssl_server_name yaml to limit the scope  my concern is flexibility  remap rule is finer grain than fqdn matching  i can think of use case where additional verifications are needed for some paths but not others  even they are served in the same host  for instance   https   host123 domain com login_service  verifies the cert while  https   host123 domain com faq  does not  this usually happens for hosts with multi tenant services  i think this boils down to how much cost to make ssl hooks transactional vs implementing the proposal

well  i would imagine some magic keycombo for fugitive status window  something that matches the awesome speed of doing c a    stage stuff for a fixup   hit c f       not sure what next  most important thing would be to easily find and enter the commit hash you want to fixup   maybe display a selectable commit browser here  right now i find commit hashes mostly with the help of gitv  but that's a bit clumsy   leader gv  wait for commit list load  find commit  copy hash with mouse  paste somewhere   
yeah  i have a local diff at home which has fugitive message if your worktree is broken  so at least you know fugitive knows that things are going south   just need to get it to be more descriptive at how to fix it and i'll file a pr 
thanks a lot for your reply  i'm trying to reproduce the problem again now  but i'm not able to do it anymore  right now the output of   map c  is   n c     c u gcommit cr   i'll update the issue if i can get some more info 
i'm probably doing it wrong  but  git_editor false git commit  returns 
    i am not a smart man  i spent bloody hours hacking at it last night before giving up and opening an issue  sorry for wasting your time 
can confirm it's fixed on 6cd8ff77f03b08ae133e35fabd87122a50231c36 using git version 1 9 1  thanks 
its an idea that occurred to me recently when i looked at my gitconfig and discovered the following   giggle  main window maximized   true main window geometry   700x550+1280+18 file view hpane position   403  giggle  is a git gui i tried for 30 seconds once  as for the potential downsides   you're the expert there  i just imagine that it could save all manner of arcane vim scripting as the storage retrieval engine is part of git  the 'registering' thing is just an throwaway example  one could create an interface to open 'registered' projects from within vim  if you're into that type of thing   if i wasn't staring down the barrel of phd submission deadlines  i might try teaching myself vim scripting and play around myself 
it works correctly  bofore   ip fugitive  it errors out  after it returns 1
it looks like   sorry  my vim is built without debug symbols 
thx for the link to the error  is there a way to see the full error  log   in vim  anyways   directory  seems to be the default      tmp  var tmp  tmp i did find an  swp in both    src x  main cpp swp  _and_   var tmp main cpp swp   deleting the second fixed the issue 
actually  based on that strace output i think  cygdrive might not actually be the problem  perhaps at some point when you've reached " " you are either actually getting back "  " or maybe are appending another " "  i e    objects instead of  objects  which cygwin then helpfully interprets as a unc path 
on closer expection it seems like it has actually something to do with git instead of fugitive  my mistake 
sadly  no  no biggie  this isn't production work   echo b git_dir  reports correctly 
no i haven't customized this 
confirmed the fix  thanks  this is what the buffer looks like    twilight__tmux_new_ s_twilight__tmux__and_ fugitive_detect _error_when_using_ buffergator __issue__464__tpope_vim fugitive  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 388761 2598737 5e8ead60 bace 11e3 8dd4 7a6f4274b561 png 
  gedit head in fact   the problems is that submodule dir in git index is not a tree blob  it is a commint blob  so it can't show it correctly  
i guess if it brings the focus back to the blame window that's alright  as for the output you asked for   echo b fugitive_blamed_bufnr  returns  1   echo b fugitive_blamed_arguments  doesn't return anything  not even an error   echo w fugitive_leave  returns  call setwinvar bufwinnr 1  " scrollbind" 0  call setwinvar bufwinnr 1  " wrap" 1  call setwinvar bufwinnr 1  " foldenable" 1  
 tpope no  when i select "load file"  the split window is still blank  and when i enter 'alt+tab' switch back to gvim  the warning message pop again 
yes and yes  interesting  i've had that in my settings for forever 
no  session man is not required to reproduce  if i uninstall it  i still get the same behavior 
i agree  and also i've noticed that removing  tabnew  is only relevant when there is only one open window  since once the command ends it goes back to the previous buffer  however  if you have multiple windows  once the command ends it closes the previous window  and the file you were working on disappears    i thought about a few more options  1   split  or  vsplit   personally  i find  vsplit  more useful for git related tasks since i need more height than width   2   tab split 
when i tried to reproduce this by finding renames on other repos  i instead hit #607  it does still occur where i first saw it  though  so there must be something different about the renames in question        as for why i sometimes see this and sometimes #607   i'm really not sure  it's not specifically because the new name is a substring of the old one    manageiq manageiq's  gems pending gemfile   nee  lib gemfile   shows the same behaviour  and it's not related to the basename matching  rails rails's  railties exe rails  nee  railties bin rails  manifested the #607 error instead 
yes  when i    git status  i get the expected output from the command line  to add to this  i can run other commands such as   gblame  which behave as expected  so far it just seems to be  gstatus it's very possible an issue with my shell config as i am still very green in the world of vim 
no symlinks in any of the paths i am editting      echo b git_dir  outputs    git 
yep  that's it  adding an explicit  set nocompatible  to my   vimrc  fixed the issue  and now it appears to take a constant  4 ms whether it checks  compatible  or not  thanks for pointing out that issue with   startuptime  
it fails on first call   gcommit  m message does not work

yup   naturally as i create the issue i find the issue being a pre commit hook bug  sorry for wasting your time 
yep  now it's working  thanks 
it does  yes  😉
  cr   opens the file without error  it doe snot open any diff windows  the cursor goes to the status bar and then it gets stuck    screenshot 2018 12 31 01 46 48  https   user images githubusercontent com 9424192 50549310 f5845500 0c9d 11e9 9fcc 9215e2fdfff0 png  the only way i can get out of it without killing vim is to ctrl c and i see this in the status bar      screenshot 2018 12 31 01 47 24  https   user images githubusercontent com 9424192 50549315 18166e00 0c9e 11e9 847a fb645747acf9 png 
it was about opening the working dir version of the file  but now i found the same could be done by  gread  after opening it's commit's version from the hunk  only cursor resets that way  unfortunately 
git version 1 8 3 1
  echo system 'git log  1'   works fine  i found out  that i have this in my vimrc  which breaks fugitive   let g fugitive_git_executable   'lang en_us utf 8 git'  without it everything works 
you are right  i use git to backup my     zshrc   so what should i do to avoid this phenomenon 
i don't  should it be   i do have   editor  set to  nvim  
that was the problem  this issue does not occur with the current nightly neovim appimage 
git diff   binary  vim spell en utf 8 add spl
you are rigth   set filetype fugitiveblame    this line triggers the error  however  it is after the part which loads plugins  this doesn't happen on ubuntu 18 04 where i also use the same dotfiles  vimrc  do you have an idea on what could be the problem  or if there were some similar issues 
that was it  i can't believe i checked for any pre commit hooks and not post commit  thanks  and sorry for wasting your time  this is probably not the right place for this  but do you accept one time donations or only sponsorships 
when open only  a txt  i think vim should ends or show new file  while open other files i think  a txt  screen should be closed  my explanation may be vague sometimes because of i'm not fluent in english

thanks stefan  we're currently on 2 0 1  as i said earlier we already found a workaround so might not upgrade at the moment  oh  and sorry for the duplicate issue 
2 11 apologies  i've been using play slick and according to the documentation  should have brought in 3 0  i'll work out whats going on  thank you
ah no     that would do it    i didn't see that anywhere     is there a doc somewhere 
is there any instruction on this  i'm very new to slick 
first  thanks for the workaround   second  i'm wowed by your reactivity  and third  unfortunately  macros are one part of scala i'm really not familiar with  it doesn't seem too hard  i'll try it later today if i can find the time  i don't agree with your assessment that this is not a bug  though  the implicit companion object for a case class does seem to implement the function1 trait  as the tupled method can be called on it  but the scala specification doesn't mention it  i think it's an implementation quirk of the compiler  and we should probably not rely on it  besides  i've pretty much never seen people implement function1 when they write companion objects  so it will probably catch a lot of them unaware as well 
 itaross i just quickly tried that change but this is the result of removing  autoincrement   false  from  postgresprofile    i'll try to have another more in depth look  but it would help for maintainers to give us hints on this if they know what's up off the top of their head 
ok totally weird but i had two versions of the gem on my system  deleted the old one and then this all loaded fine  then i tried to install the old one again to replicate  and it was still working  i'm going to chalk this one up to the "ghost in the machine"   i will let you know if it comes back to haunt me thanks for the quick reply though   
so i later realized my initial post is incorrect in explaining the problem i am having  i had some confusion with single table inheritance and got mixed up  the actual issue is with it falling back on a generic email attribute vs my email model attributes   so unless i have user  email  'user email' the hint returned for user email is  toemail tofromemail from  instead of falling back to the generic  enter a valid email address  sorry for the confusion earlier  i knew it was working like i expected  but the problem description is totally different 
i have update rails but the bug is still there  on the other hand  i failed to reproduce the bug into an empty rails application  created with rails 3 0 5  thanks for your help  i will keep you up to date 
never mind  i wasn't aware that simple_form adds its own id's for form elements  so i just had to change the selectors in my javascript  my mistake 
here is the error i got 
#1250 opened
i found the issue  after 2 hours in the debugger   simple_form is not compatible with haml 3 1 3  culprit is the method 'content_tag_with_haml' please upgrade to haml 3 1 4 which fixes the issue  http   haml lang com docs yardoc file haml_changelog html#backwards_incompatibilities__must_read ps  gosh  it's so much harder to debug ruby than java    those blocks obfuscate the debug process in the debugger so much   
hmm  not sure what you mean by customization   i don't think so   my current simple_form rb initlaized is this 
however this line of code solves my problem  i'd really like the html5 validation   code  config browser_validations   false   code  so i prefer then using jquery rails 2 0 2 instead of 2 1 1 moreover i disabled all validations  so the  code require  code  didn't appear anywhere  i still couldn't submit the form   
good catch  it doesn't happen with erb 
yes  i think i can manage that 
i'm using 2 1 0 is it safe to run 3 0 0 rc 
will do  thanks  adam on friday  october 11  2013  rafael mendonça frança wrote

 feliperenan pr on ransack was merged  and it works normally with last ransack release  yes it's was not really a simple form issue  just reported  for others simple_form ransack users  because the error raised on simple_form input

yes that sounds like the same error  i have also reported the issue via the android report  i'm not sure what version i upgraded from tbh  but if there are no relevant changes in 0 8 0 then i assume that it's mpdroid  i upgraded both simultaneously  and presumed mopidy caused the issue since i assumed basic connections would have been tested well with several server types on mpdroid   
url of detail page for that track album artist soundcloud  spotify  
on android i tried version 25 0 1364 169 and on windows 8 desktop i believe it was the lastest stable chrome  it didn't complain about needing a restart to update

jodal  sorry for the delay  its 1 0 7 i am running and the bug #1175 seems to cover unicode titles inside a playlist  my described bug is caused by a "wrong" character   character encoding in the file name of the playlist itself  the playlist has been written previously by mopidy  mopidy mobile frontend  and crashed on startup after updating    unicodedecodeerror  'utf8' codec can't decode         mopidy m3u playlists py   renaming the playlist file fixed the bug and made mopidy to come up again  i have tried to reproduce the bug by renaming a playlist file in several ways to force the mentioned exception and a stack trace    nothing worked  it seems when using the command line the file   filename encoding is always right  tried  ö  Ã¶  � 
thank you  yes  its fixed  sorry   
i use them as dynamic playlists  eg  all tracks with at least a score of 3 stars  all tracks with genres x or y and a score of z+  as far as i know  there is no "shuffle all" functionality in mopidy  or most clients simply miss the option  and dynamic playlists have the added advantage that you can easily exclude annoying tracks without having to remove them from your library    such large playlists are obviously exceptions but the delay is also noticeable with small   500 tracks  playlists  noticeable delay meaning anything between 7 and 15 seconds  even on the small playlists  simply starting a single song takes about 3 seconds 
after 1 week i there was no response on https   discuss mopidy com t bt output only white noise when playing local files or internet radio 1076

 jeremyskinner thanks for reply  in my case i'm using  cascade cascademode stoponfirstfailure   so that function would be called once for each rule  extension called  onfailure  would be even better  this way it would be possible to call specific function when failure occurs  but i really would like to be able to get  propertyvalidatorcontext  there  because i want to log error message to database and current context values and even change error message  i've tried creating extension method that would be called last for each rule  like this   can above be done and do you think it would be useful  i can try creating something and if i success do pr  but first i need to know where to start

well  this time  i don't see the  fluentvalidation ivalidatorfactory  error  however  my action returns 200 but it shouldn't 
hi jeremy  thank for your quick response  i use fluent validation in  monkey repo  https   github com stssoftware monkey  i just revert to version 7 3 3  please upgrade to 7 3 4 and see the error detail

jeremy  you're correct  this is a rather old commit referenced in a academic paper   i'm trying to reproduce their results using the same commit they are  do you happen to know what environment was used at the time of _445f6390f31b4851efb274cef6bddac184c873f7_   it says but  i'm able to run msbuild on the  sln file from command line and this will successfully build fluentvalidation  i do believe i have everything you mentioned above checked in visual studio installer  i'm running vs2017 community  if that matters  i'm just unsure why it's not building from within visual studio when i think i have your config exactly  and curious why you're not seeing the same messages that i am

i haven't written any code to do it but if i would proceed with it i would loop thought the modelstate dictionary  parse the keys  breaking them up by property name with index and adding them to a temporary dictionary of sorts  since the items in the modelstate is chronological it makes sense to say that it could be mapped   the first occurence of mycollection with a guid could be said to have index 0  building the indexed would have to be recursive though  as property names could be repeated inside the graph

ok  how do i get the display name localized  when i use the fluentvalidation i should get something like this   'ipaddress' must be 256 characters or fewer'   but this is what it displayed   "seller activities fields ipaddress" must be 256 characters or fewer'    i have my localization resources available  asp  net core is able to understand   "seller activities fields ipaddress"   through the   adddataannotationslocalization adds support for localized dataannotations validation messages through istringlocalizer abstractions    public class activitymodel    display name   "seller activities fields id"  prompt   "seller activities fields id prompt"   public long id   get  set    public ilist selectlistitem  availableactivitytypes   get  set      new list selectlistitem      display name   "seller activities fields activitytypeid"  prompt   "seller activities fields activitytypeid prompt"   public long activitytypeid   get  set    public ilist selectlistitem  availableusers   get  set      new list selectlistitem      display name   "seller activities fields userid"  prompt   "seller activities fields userid prompt"   public long userid   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields ipaddress"  prompt   "seller activities fields ipaddress prompt"   public string ipaddress   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields comment"  prompt   "seller activities fields comment prompt"   public string comment   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields entityid"  prompt   "seller activities fields entityid prompt"   public long entityid   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields entitytype"  prompt   "seller activities fields entitytype prompt"   public string entitytype   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields createdat"  prompt   "seller activities fields createdat prompt"   public datetimeoffset createdat   get  set     display name   "seller activities fields updatedat"  prompt   "seller activities fields updatedat prompt"   public datetimeoffset  updatedat   get  set      fluentvalidation shouldn't use 'seller activities fields updatedat' as the display name  it should rather use the istringlocalizer to determine the name 
sorry  for that  i have used code symbol from editor and i got single quote

sorry  this is not for asking help  just show some workaround for issure #1180   maybe someone could use it  since #1180 has been locked 
interesting  ok so i have been playing around with a sample application and it seems to work when there is no  maxlength x   attribute on the property  however i was doing this to stop users from being able to enter that many characters anyway  the way in which i was getting this to appear incorrectly was applying the  maxlength 3   attribute to the model and then editing the dom to edit the maximumlength "3" to maximumlength "10" and in that scenario is where you see the incorrect message  so i guess the fix here is to not allow attributes to override custom messages maybe  anyway i have attached a minimal example if you wish to review it   fluentvalidationtest zip  https   github com jeremyskinner fluentvalidation files 3896764 fluentvalidationtest zip 
thanks i already read it  i saw a comment in  this  https   github com fluentvalidation fluentvalidation issues 985  and i did not understand how can i use fluentvalidation without mvc now i understand that i have to install both fluentvalidation   fluentvalidation aspnetcore and call addmvc   addfluentvalidation
hi desandro  this will be the last piece of the puzzle    in this fiddle  http   jsfiddle net desandro cnb7r 22 show light  this is exactly where i'm getting at where everything is responsive and all but there's only one problem  the container doesn't really have a fix width  i tried putting a width on #stream of 980px and a margin of 0 auto so that it would centralize  as it is responsive  but the whole layout will be cut  as with the preview below   this is because of the overflow  hidden of the other div  but if you put visible  it won't be cut  but still will not be centralize  if you don't put a width then the margin 0 auto will not work since i think the default width will always be 100  and therefore a space on the right will be visible on a wider screen as with the fiddle  this is the last piece  i know it'll be easy now but i just can't figure out    desandro  https   f cloud github com assets 3022660 19885 03d97cfc 4936 11e2 8eda 435e137d635c jpg 
sorry my english is not fluent so would you can tell me your google+ account  then we can talk about this problem 
i was not  goodness  it was 1 1 1  simply copied in the 1 2 0 version of masonry and i no longer have the crash     simpler theme because i don't need to check that it's necessary on the page before loading it  and no crashing  of course  sometime i will need to stop loading it on every page to help performance  but for now it works  case closed     thanks  desandro 
just sent you a private message  the work is still under wraps  thanks  stewart
yes i resolved it  thank you  i had some issues with the fitvid script i use combined with masonry  the jquery code wasn't written properly by me 
interestingly enough  recreating it in a jsfiddle shows no issue  don't have a live link at this time  to solve it on this particular build  i added box sizing  content box  to my container  i've calculating the top padding via js  so that could be another contributing factor

thanks for the reply  the ideal solution would be for it to just work in ie7  like older versions did  example  bdwm be cs works fine in ie7   but i understand technology has to move forward and you can't be supporting older browsers forever  so i would indeed just return  or at least make kind of a try catch structure for your code  so everything else doesn't fail depending on a single plugin  really  i love your script  but i had to search for an alternative just because my client demands the website to work in ie7+  but as i mentinoned  simply loading the masonry js file in ie7 is enough to make all other javascript fail 
i don't  sorry  it may have just been the vm at browserstack that was acting oddly  i've come across other instances where it doesn't act as it should pertaining to javascript  compared to a real instance of ie8 
oke i will write in codepen    but your masonry awesome  thank's
ok    so i've an external page  page html  with this html tags      elements are appended correctly  but they are all overlapping    i don't understand why    what i want to achieve is to take elements from an external page and loading them dynamically in my masonry container  thanks

i can certainly try to do that  i want to try one more thing to clear this up before i do though  also  did you have a look at my initialization script  did i do that properly with the imagesloaded portion  i didn’t see an example of it on your site that also included the typekit portion so i cobbled it together and have no idea if that’s the proper way to do it  thanks so much 
you should read your issue posts more carefully  "desandro"  1  how to insert a div within the list of divs  not append  not prepend    for this you need no test case  please just answer  2  your animations do not work properly  i used your instructions as is and they do not move as smoothly as on your frontpage  in your previous vanilla version of masonry you had different animation styles  is it possible to try different ones in the current version  3   too  because as i said the current one is not smooth

i think it should be improved as a whole  it should be similar as much as possible to standard browser behavior when submitting a form  what's the point of "formdata  " method  and submit   in "connection" class since it uses the same "formdata  "  if it gets  sends  the wrong values  by sending wrong values the server's logic doesn't like   understand them and the form submission doesn't work at all

yes  that's true until a certain point it get's better  but as said  we have very big machines  in detail they have 80 cpu cores  196gb memory and a threadpool with the size of up to 200 was used  in the thread dump we could see that nearly all of them were waiting for the monitor as shown above  as a workaround we now re implemented the textnode text   funktion like this   to not use a stringbuilder from the pool and it clearly solved the performance problem and we don't see problems related to the many stringbuilders created

would storing a session cookie header on the replication doc work  it would mean a replication would risk expiring  but as long as requests are being made in the session timeout window  the replicator would stay authenticated  similar to how continuous replication works from a browser client using pouchdb    i'll close this out as it sounds like this is expected behavior without a current alternative

sorry  but i don't know  as i understand  the meaning of  require_valid_user  is to protect all request by default  so you can't access       _all_dbs   etc  without basic auth  why is this not the default behavior for cookie auth  restrict all access and if you do a post request to   _session  with the correct credentials  you will get the cookie and are allowed to access these "global" endpoints 
our case is that the database is the source of truth  a user logins and that user only needs to start listening   replicating from the beginning of a bunch of documents  normally  at 3 4 of the database  retrieving such documents and then using changes with "now" could mean that between those two operations some changes are lost    i guess they should work in parallel but that just complicates things  first  changes with since now and afterwards retrieving the documents of interest with a startkey since the ids of the new generated documents are unknown  imagine a tree of documents with a common root   we are used to use it with pouchdb as described in my first comment  "since" value of the minimum sequence of that bunch of documents minus one   but with the sequence number change for couchdb 2 x  it destroyed that possibility i guess
ok  but i now have couchdb v2 3 1 installed  can i keep that installed 
it's a solid idea  when i'm back on it  i'll restructure my source and try to set up a softlink at   project_root  node_modules view lib  pointing to e g    project_root  couchdb designdocs  viewname  lib  it has the shortcoming that the softlink would only work in suitable filesystems  and would have to be dynamically switched by the testing environment depending on the   viewname   under test but if the hack works  it's certainly an option  only has to work in the testing environment after all

 mattbrictson hmm    that's very strange    i'm not using fork but i'm using capistrano with symfony plugin  below my full configuration  gemfile  ruby 2 2 1p85  2015 02 26 revision 49769   x86_64 linux  when i'm using branch develop  test or master everything works fine

so what you're saying is  we should create the structure manually rather than expecting  cap install  to do it for us  i'll try it tomorrow and see what happens first then close this issue if it works  thanks for the info 
yes  it would be good if it can display the clear message instead of ambiguous  can't modify frozen # class # rake  task 0x007f98992971b8    that these packages are required  as its displaying when i tried to enable the "set  scm   git" and it says that this does not supported anymore  you have to use the below lines in capfile 
thanks  matt  looks like this is something in my config  i haven't found the problem yet  i will open another issue if required 
i can spend some time looking into getconf arg_max  one unknown to me is i'm not sure if its safe to assume each directory string has the same amount of bytes  the math might be hard to do if they aren't 
no  i added others files and folders to linked_dirs and linked_files but not  htaccess  in fact based on what i made would have  htaccess updated   like others files and folders of my projects   with that on git repo but not in this case   htaccess is old respect of what i have on my git repo 
  ruby generate_keys rb   ruby sign_update rb app zip dsa_priv pem then i use "ls  l app zip" to check the dimension of the file  to fill the length field in the appcast xml xcode console error    after the download of the update is completed  sparkle error  the update is improperly signed  i don't have any  log in libray folder  and as i said before  i also tried using feeder  so i'm not sure what problem can be  maybe some problem when i generate the keys 
looks like that's probably the culprit  thanks  zorgiepoo 
 pornel   as  fernandomorgan said  i include my private key in the build
yep  an export option would definitely suffice  i saw the "password" in the keychain  but in my experience private keys generally have a definite format  such as       begin rsa private key      gobbeldygook      end rsa private key      i wasn't sure if just that password string in a file would be sufficient  or if 25519 keys need specific formatting 
i have no way to measure traffic  or to differentiate between users who are being prompted to update but choose not to  the metrics that i am referring to is a users table which gets updated bases on user activity  based on that i am being able to see that are lots of users which did not update for 1 week  but are active  there may be users who dismiss the update  but i doubt that all of them did so   since i noticed the sulastchecktime issues above   also  based on this i noticed that there are users that updated  but i am not able to figure out if the update dialog came from a periodic check  so my conclusion remains the same  for some reasons the scheduled check for updates fails to work properly 
sorry i didn't describe the issue precisely  here's what i got  i pulled the source and tried to make a clean build but managed to reproduce this error message at suversioncomparisontest m in sparkle unit tests    xctest xctest h  file not found 
i have a flow where i let the user click a update button and it instructs them that its updating in the background  where there is no release notes ui  download progress ui or extracting update ui   when the update is done  after downloading and extracting  the install and relaunch window comes to the front  that's the only time a user will be able to update the app 
using get info from the finder on the sparkle framework file 
reverted to sparkle ver  1 15 1 and it seems to be working fine now  my guess it has something to do with 'guided package installs'
i don't know how it was designed to be but here are a couple options off the top of my head for how it might work  1  copywithoutdeltaupdates must actually create a copy of appcast without delta updates items  meaning    the second call may be sent the original appcast  the first option looks more flexible to customize 
unfortunately zip also fails   my app failed to release quarantine on  users username library containers com example my app data library caches com examplemy  pp org sparkle project sparkle my app  autoupdate  app with error error domain nsposixerrordomain code 1 "operation not permitted" userinfo  nslocalizeddescription failed to remove file quarantine on my app  autoupdate  app    my app has been signed with my developer id and rb app checker reports that everything is okay with it  the zip file i also signed   codesign  s "developer id application  my name"   keychain " users username library keychains login keychain" "myapp zip"  and successfully verified  i can also download the zip with safari and open the app without translocation   gatekeeper complaining  hmm   
unfortunately  currently not  sorry  very little time and i’d rather not touch anything written in swift …  innocent 
i did  my fault  i initially did  git clone  instead of  git clone   recursive   when i pulled in the submodule it worked fine  maybe the readme should mention it 
no it had this  i'll change it to 1 0 and retry   which do have two different signatures  and even have two different files specified but they're both listed as version 1 0
thanks for your quick reply  would it help to send you the appcast xml  i'd like to send it by email   can you send me your email address 
 kornelski yeah it does
this speculation of mine was wrong  it is true  i couldn't set ksecattrprotocol  but ksecattrprotocol is meaningless ignored on generic passwords like the one sparkle uses to store the ed25519 private key  see #1448 
sure  just not sure which of the sector variants is the desired one 
i expect that if i delete the limit it should default to   or another fixed number   then you should have a more button to show you all possible values if there are more than 10  2 reasons for that  1  it doesn't make any sense not to show the more button when there are more possible values  2  if not writing a limit defaults to writing  limit    10  it should act like when writing  limit    10  right now if i write no limit  or write  limit    10 i get different results  no limit won't render the more button  
looks better  maybe add at the end of "easy" something like _continue with the step 6 below_ to indicate that we are not completely done here yet

great  i'm looking forward this new feature and next opal release  native enhacements make me happy  thanks 
yes  but not directly  i propose to use ast format from whitequark parser  it's a good idea ss far as we have two parsers that produce ast in this format  the original whitequark parser and the pure js parser  and the format is fairly useful  the api i wish once to see is like this   the main reason of processing only the resulting ast is those extra  begin    dstr   etc  node which can be eliminated or transformed by parser only some time after the actual node is created  light form of static analysis  that mean the parser transforms the half baked ast somehow in the middle of the process  so  we have no chance to get the sax interface  familiar by xml parsers  and must wait fro parser to finish its work before touching the ast  that's why i vote to separate the two phases  parsing and translating  as a handy outcome we will have the clean interface with common documented ast format  and become able to plug in other lexer parser  which is my main goal here  p s  i'd like to make opal fully client side thing  or node js side   the main obstacle for our team was a ruby oriented parser  so we have made  pure js precise lexer parser  https   github com kung fu tzu ruby parser js  which is light and fast  this gives developer a clear way to develop in ruby without any ruby interpreter on her machine by just including  opal parser js   the js parser tries it's best to repeat almost all the warnings  errors  and tokent names from the original mri  as far as it's just a port  not an implementation  from c to js  p p s  by the way  at some shiny day in future we might see a true ast optimizer  like closure is for js 
i just run tests by default and find it odd  when they don't succeed  i can't be sure if my environment fails or if the package is broken  it's okay  if you tell me that the tests won't succeed 
yes  very embarrassing  the error was in the  postgresql yml   i'm sorry to have bothered you 
thanks  good work  i can confirm that this fixed my original issue  i actually ended up redirecting manually in getauthid for two reason  and i would still need to do that  1  i needed different redirects  as a simple case  when the user adds a new identifier  send him to referer  otherwise to logindest  2  i needed different system messages  but calls to setmessage gets overwritten  that might not be too bad  though  with redirecttorefrere set to false  setcreds do the right thing when the user is not already logged in  and otherwise i manually redirect  only downside i see is that it doesn't respect calls to setcreds false  which i don't use  it's most likely not be worth it making up some complicated logic  or letting getauthid return the possible redirect route which would cause breakage 
i will definitely try to send a pull request  however i would like to know what route  pun unintended  to take 1  shall i write a function say  mkdispatchinstance   modulo bikeshedding  that derives  yesoddispatch  instance or 2  fix the returned value of  mkdispatchclause   essentially add one more argument for the logger  and pass them to dispatch and runner functions or 3  both 2 and 3 are breaking changes and as i understand it will require changes in  yesod core  as well so i think 1 is a safe option  please take a call on 2 and or 3
hi again  yup  got those exact 3 lines    there's an extra space on the 2nd line before the last hash  but removing that has no effect  
i'd personally be in favor of an environment variable solution with overriding switches  so that sandbox unaware applications can just rely on the user to set the environment variable and sandbox aware ones can explicitly pass switches  luite  passing arbitrary options to cabal dev isn't enough  you need to add   package conf   sandboxes yesod packages 7 4 1 conf  to the runghc invocation 
see the details in the other thread i cross referenced  https   github com mozilla browserid issues 2718 they are saying that  get is deprecated  either persona needs to fix things to make  get work more like people would expect  or things need to be clarified that it is deprecated  or that it has certain limited function which is not what it was before… i don't know enough to judge the situation  but you can look at my other ticket and figure out what to do  thanks
can you upload an updated version of shakespeare to hackage  thank you
 snoyberg just tried  yeah  it's starting compiling  what's the root cause of this 
well  now i can't reproduce it either  fixed 
yes  it builds fine now  thank you 
i'm not using  ghc mod  at the moment  i did check with  nmap  and  lsof   there is nothing bound to port  3000  
yes  interesting is the right word  i guess     re  rendering as a lazy byte string  i think that's what i did with liftio   print  encode val   or did you mean rendering to a lazy byte string and then sending that as a response 
i did  cabal update    cabal fetch yesod   using a clean ghc with  cabal install  version 1 22 4 0  has the  yesod  team given up on supporting  cabal install   i see the stackage lts resolver is a rather old 2 17 
i would like to  but i just start to work with haskell in last few days  so could you help me please

that will work for chrome  which sends a header  and other browsers  but unfortunately won't work for safari because safari doesn't appear to to send a header to distinguish a prefetch preload request from a proper user driven request  not sure this is solvable  just thought i'd post in case there was a known workaround hack  i believe that it's possible to augment links with some prefetch preload metadata in some way  so it might be worth someone investigating whether  auth  login logout  links can be modified when presented so give hint to browser  anyway  thanks michael 
 hallem   i'm sorry for late response we have a different gmt  so i'll look into this branch and see if works in my case and answer you for merge   if not i'll show to you my case 
i have an app which downloads images from tumblr platform  i currently use webclient for file download async purposes which give me an ability to track how much of the file has been downloaded and report that to ui so it can display the percentage of download per file  i have just come across the restsharp and like the faster speed of it   i use now to crawl the api posts before download 
i'm trying to upload a large file with chunks to google drive cloud  more than 2gb   with int type i can't specify any range after 2gb  https   developers google com drive web manage uploads
i'm using restsharp to log some information  i want to log a line like   http 1 0  or  http 1 1  for the version of http for the connection 
i just commented out the offending lines 
no the response content contains the access_token and the refresh_token        but i want to know  for a wpf application  where can i save my refresh token  and how to use it to generate an access token if the first one is expired   a client application sample 
thank you for your answer  yes  core 2 0 sdk is installed  but it doesn't help  i have deleted the nuget dependence and than i can compile the dll 
 alexeyzimarev hey sorry  i have never done anything in c# other than calling our own api once the other day  because a customer complained that it didn't work  so i don't really have any clue where to start with doing the test  if you have to close the issue then i understand 
the simple rest and http api client for  net  the error is by this code  target name "getassemblyversion"   getassemblyversion condition "'  assemblyversion '    ''" nugetversion "  version "   output taskparameter "assemblyversion" propertyname "assemblyversion"      getassemblyversion   propertygroup   fileversion condition "'  fileversion '    ''"   assemblyversion   fileversion   informationalversion condition "'  informationalversion '    ''"   version   informationalversion    propertygroup    target  i don't now what to fix over here 
yes  currently i have a different type of problem and it occurs when transferring large files such as 5gb  10gb  because the ram memory is full  i have to send files as a body  otherwise i have this problem with adding headers to the content of files  is it possible to send the file as a body but without loading the whole file to memory 
that is the thing i am not using it directly  i am using callfire com's c# library that is using it  and though that library is working with 106 4 2 fine but it fails with 106 5 3 and 106 5 4  i inform the callfire developer repo as well to update his code to your library  but it seems like breaking change for minor version upgrade 
i've been also using onbeforedeserialization   to set the response encoding as   but it also didn't help  the response data has all correctly mapped "myclaim" objects  but swedish values of the properties still have those � signs    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 9724446 50473584 262a6d00 09c6 11e9 8108 69d88758086b png 
still not working  i need class1 serialized into the request body  as i can see in addjsonbiody method  in proper way  so i create custom serializer and adjust custom serializer to restrequest jsonserializer  but when i call addjsonbody obj  serialize mthod of custom serializer is not called  how ever the summary from restrequest cs concerning restrequest jsonsrializer sounds like this method must be called   correct me if i wrong  here is the summary       summary      serializer to use when writing json request bodies  used if requestformat is json      by default the included jsonserializer is used  currently using json net default serialization         summary  public iserializer jsonserializer   get  set   
  v106 6 5    when i execute the code above   xmlrestserializer is being picked for serialization instead of dotnetxmlserializer one    v106 5 4    works as expected 
sorry  i didn’t put it that way  yes  that's what i meant
 alexeyzimarev that seems to work   
more details  the new sff file written by biopython has all records  the assert happens after the very last record  there are 2 other cases  files  derived from same sra input file  for all of them the assert happens just after the very last entry  second  "sffinfo  a" complains with error  number of reads found in sff file does not equal number_of_reads field  a header of the new sff files written by biopython says  common header  magic number  0x2e736666 version  0001 index offset  0 index length  0 # of reads  0 header length  840 key length  4 # of flows  800 flowgram code  1 the original header was  common header  magic number  0x2e736666 version  0001 index offset  257093656 index length  1471468 # of reads  73573 header length  840 key length  4 # of flows  800 flowgram code  1 so i conclude the "error"  looks functionally as a warning instead      is about the zero number of reads in the header  probably nothing to do with the biopython assert but let me ask  isn't this a regression from 1 62 or 1 61  i haven't seen a complaint that the number of reads is zero in sff files written by biopython so far    sffinfo  a srr653464_gm2u7v102 sff   wc  l 73573   sffinfo  a srr653464_gm2u7v102 biopython sff   wc  l error  number of reads found in sff file does not equal number_of_reads field  73573   to answer your question  258565124 feb 18 13 34 srr653464_gm2u7v102 sff 257093656 feb 25 18 48 srr653464_gm2u7v102 biopython sff
it is still giving me the error at 6 54 mountain time  have you run the code on windows  thanks
conda version  3 5 5  via  conda info   biopython version  1 63  via  conda list   there are 189 dtd files in my local  anaconda lib python2 7 site packages bio entrez dtds  including the ones i manually downloaded  
thank you  peterjc  it works with _io textiowrapper_ in py3  python 3 4 1   but failed in py2 
 mdehoon i've update this issue 
 peterjc hi  i was just solving  a problem  http   rosalind info problems mrna   on rosalind  not sure if there is any real world use case 
 peterjc how do i check that 
it's version 1 67  actually  the problem only seems to occur if i change compoundlocations  even when reconstructing the original one  if i don't touch them they stay the same as in the original  example   on the following file   pvc01_00_203 embl zip  https   github com biopython biopython files 385648 pvc01_00_203 embl zip 
dask  http   dask pydata org  requires seekable files for efficient reading  and in this particular case  i have a bunch of files from gtex analysis  http   www gtexportal org  that that weigh up to 14gb uncompressed 
yes  that's what i did  it just took forever for conda to install so i could test it  fyi 1 67 is the latest on conda 
 peterjc yes  i am on d465649  git log  n 3 
hi  thank you for responding    my biopython version is 1 68 working under the following system    module load python anaconda3 4 0 0   python python 3 5 3  anaconda custom  64 bit    default  feb 22 2017  21 13 27   gcc 4 4 7 20120313  red hat 4 4 7 1   on linux the anaconda was forced by it so i'm not sure how to answer your question  i can try and ask them if you think it can help solve this issue  thanks michal
i liked the convenience of having the remark information in the object  so in my fork i added logic to extract the key value pairs per the specification here  http   scop berkeley edu astral pdbstyle https   github com mikepm35 biopython commit 9adfe52ae11abf73bb13de68a193d362d3ac9522  understood that this may not have broad enough utility to pull in 
hey  thanks for the quick response  yes  exactly  that seems better than the silent error it produces right now and might save others a bit of debugging time  depending on the use case  the workaround of writing the entire file at once rather than appending may be acceptable 
i've redownloaded the file  and it looks like the new file seems to work  not sure why the old file failed    it looks like a genbank  but the issue seems to be gone now  so i'm going to close this  thanks 
is that the culprit 
awesome  thanks ryan

action was show and the can was the one above  but nevermind  found another topic with similar problem  which explained the source of the problem also   authorize_resource  which happens before the action and the "manual assignment" of the instance variables   so load_and_authorize_resource fixed it  would be nice thogh if authorize_resource would happen after the instance variables are assigned in the action   
hi ryan  yes  it does work for me now the hash  the reason i ended up using a block was to check the authentic polymorphic relationship like below  looking at the code again  i don't know why i didn't put this check at site although i put that in operator   it seems we can't achieve this just by using hash  i guess   thanks for the quick reply  much appreciated  your big fan  phyo
yup  thanks a lot
yes  that's exactly what i'm doing now  i'm pondering if more sensible defaults can be devised  as in   i'm not sure if this just ads more bloat or is plain useful  it's just a tought     since devise does it   
ah  cool  wasn't aware of that  is it also possible to do can   do_something   do_something_else   user   also it would be nice to have some automatic way of handling non rest controllers  right now i created a before filter that does authorize   open  "# params  controller  _# params  action  " to_sym haven't tested it yet though  wonder if there will be a nice built in way in 2 0  or can i do this better already  i don't like having to add authorize calls to every action  and also it would be nice to have a way of grouping those actions  so that i can do can  manage   admin_actions cannot  open   admin_index you get the idea  it's not very clean yet    not sure how to best do it 
okay  so perhaps i can suggest some clearer text where it says important  how about 
i am overriding the ability rb like this  module onedesigncompany class abilitydecorator include cancan  ability  end end ability class_eval   register_ability onedesigncompany  abilitydecorator  
sorry it took so long to get back to this  here is my contacts controller 
no i didn't authorize explicitly  actually it is very simple controller with basic crud  i was just testing with cancan note  if i add  can   or  cannot   method in the view  then it is restricting the report and got exception 
yeah  that's how i expected it to work 
wiki page  controller authorization example  https   github com ryanb cancan wiki controller authorization example  is updated and linked to this issue 
cool  interesting to see that the side channels get a bit of a boost  also does that mean that sfx volumes only ever go to half the maximum amplitude  even when the slider is at max  that would be pretty noisy on an 8 bit card

no  but i don't recall seeing what officially constitutes one either  i guess correct would be not jquery plugin per se  but rather depends on jquery 
with the use of the checkbox  the user does not have to ctrl+click to select multiple rows  nor know they have to 
in the example1 your displying the data from the for loop  i just want to disply data from database using webservice  
sure   2 at the moment    alter viewport height based on combined row height if there is unused space  ie viewport   600px  only have 3 rows  would like to adjust the height once rendered   cant at the moment as the async render means the dom eles have no height yet    would like to position some elements to float against the grid  fairly similar to above  and have been able to work around using jquery ui position selectors  ie  my 'right top'  at 'right bottom'  of 'div slick row last'  if you think it would bloat the event api fair enough   it just seemed like something people maybe want to do  or perhaps new slick grid could return a promise  although that is then adding jquery version dependency  and a bit more complicated change btw love the grid

 styfle thanks for responding  i am actually newbie with drag drop and slickgrid  can you explain how should i check on those tests on the ipad 
unfortunately  no  i haven't had time to follow up on my intial attempts  it's still a ticket for my app so i will revisit it eventually  have you 
 arielf thank you for your help  unfortunately i am getting a similar error  first i got the following output from  make gd_mf_weights  in  library    i am actually still seeing the same error that i posted earlier 
i agree with u  john  i tried many times keeping the same vw's params   and found when the num of examples exceeds 270000  the nan produced  but i can't reproduce it on a more smaller data set 
so if i set  passes 20 and   early_terminate 10  then vw will terminate after 10 passes when holdout loss doesn't decrease  right

thanks for your prompt reply  i just tried again  and both way  api create_block screen_name  api create_block userid   work now  could it possibly be i've reached my daily rate limit or something  i deleted lots of old tweets with tweeps yesterday   so the api no longer respond 
yeah i don't think either  it as never been useful to me  actually it's even the reason i was looking at the customize options for ignore case  i don't understand how this would be implemented in  post completion  but maybe it's  keep prefix  that i don't understand 
okay  thanks  i'm still getting my head around that but it's for on the fly syntax check  i have 2 sources for diagnostics  1  i'm parsing the buffer and get some diagnostics  2  i'm making a completion request and i get diagnostics along with the candidates  theses diagnostics may be different from  1    for example it will not say "hey there is an error at the symbol you are currently completing"  so what i would like to do is to use the completion diagnostics during completion  and normal diagnostics otherwise  does that sound reasonable to you

alright  it doesn't happen in emacs 24 4 anymore  thanks for pushing me to finally upgrade  d
yeah  i was trying to find a common variable like  major mode keywords  but no such thing seems to exist  it would just be too simple if a   valid major mode keywords at point   existed  right  smile  i'll cross reference this to  scala mode  and maybe the author will have some ideas 
hmm  thanks  that sort of works  i get this error  which is interesting  do you think this is the right way to deal with this  or should the yasnippet just "do the right thing" for  prefix   it still feels like  yasnippet  should be able to quite easily behave the right way for  prefix  and return  nil  when there are no possible completions for the current prefix 
such a line was indeed part of my  org mode  hook  interesting that this did work at all  since the error was on my part  i'm closing the issue 
yes  with the company idle delay set to 'seconds 0 5'  i get the same behaviour
here's a gif of the problem in action  i've actually disabled  org indent mode   so  visual line mode  is actually the most likely suspect    company  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 302945 8113084 c8612db0 10a6 11e5 88db 2306a0bdd17c gif  without visual line mode  the screen still jumps unnecessarily  it's not as if the tooltip needs space to display   but there isn't the more egregious cursor jump    company2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 302945 8124082 732df052 1110 11e5 9c50 67a5d9a894a4 gif 
yes  using space delimited words as a filter string to achieve the same result would be fine too  especially if the underlying implementation is less difficult  i only looked at existing issues with "filter" in the title when trying to avoid making a duplicate  and i didn't know ido  so i missed #313  but this issue is a duplicate 
 dgutov i fiddled with it some more and have it working  will write up how to do this back here or in a blog post later    screen shot 2015 11 27 at 6 04 02 pm  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3036816 11449622 5c8ac5f0 9531 11e5 9b25 617811ec8978 png 
that works very well  thank you so much 
 dgutov thanks for your reply  however  i'm not very familiar with elisp  so would you mind elaborating on that predicate function thing  an example would be really nice   
web mode
with  company ycmd  as the only backend  it makes no differences 
yes  local is windows with a custom path and remote is linux with the standard   usr bin global 
i do not have enough knowledge of the workings of how the menu is displayed  note  however  that the same question can be asked by a developer of emacs  if you think that the minibuffer is responsible  then how do you explain that it has the correct size in the end 
no    they don't seem to have "words from all buffers" complete  when they write languages that they don't support  they don't have any completions  so my question is "why 3 is default " whether language that company mode support is good  the default value is always 3  i want to know reason for this  and the consequences that i may have if i decrease this default value  thank you 
thanks for the quick reply  i have already uploaded the file  in pos vue zip 
it seems the gtags problem  i deleted the gtags files and regenerated them  somehow it works again  besides  when the problem occured  i was also using ggtags mode  but today i uninstalled the ggtags mode 
so far  there are only 3 tags for declarations   hidden  has been there since the beginning  i have not delved far enough into clang to say definitively what the tags mean  but just a simple base and derived class generates all three tags in a way that their names are descriptive   the compiler would return an error if any of the members marked hidden or inaccessible were accessed  option 2 filters the results desirably in that simple test  i tried it on some other projects and it "seems" to work fine  i called it a temporary fix because editing the regex template string every a tag is added seems error  but these are the first additional tags since this files origin  so the current convenience is probably fine  i forked the project and created a pull request 
 dgutov company clang  version is a variable defined in ‘company clang el’  its value is  apple   10 0  the error is "pcase exhaustive is not in emacs 24 3 "
absolutely  i just felt that it doesn't match the dark themes as good  here's a quick   before and after    ### before   img width "611" alt "screenshot 2020 02 04 at 22 26 08" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 36686900 73753290 6fd6b100 479d 11ea 97be 7d98097eebf0 png"  ### after   img width "567" alt "screenshot 2020 02 08 at 12 01 20" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 36686900 74078886 e52ad600 4a6a 11ea 9108 6f820818a1b7 png" 
   completion at point  shows nothing either  but results in a  no match  message   this is the result of  company diag  with point in the position where i called  completion at point  
with  company capf  when i type  some tab   it doesn't complete the common parts which is  thing  so it should complete to  something   while with  company dabbrev code  is works  it complete to  something   the one where i am typing the whole of "something" i am also pressing tab amongst each character for the capf mode  i know its hard to see in the gif which mode is which  but the one with more greenish colours is the  company capf  backend while the one with only red and grey is  company dabbrev code   hopefully that clarifies it  also  completion at point functions  set to 
gotcha  yeah it looks like resque  job create would be the best way to temporarily add one to a different queue  thanks 
are you ok with unix timestamps 
yes  it happens on every job  thus overloading the system with show keys calls  we had a similar problem with unicorn and solved it by adding something to the parent worker like the following  activerecord  base send  subclasses  each    k  unless k name    'slug' then k columns end   activerecord  base connection disconnect  i am also thinking about adding a pre fork hook so that we could do initialization like this and resque can stay rails agnostic  thoughts  thanks  scott
redis 2 0 1 and redis namespace 0 5 0  thanks 
i expect the calls to resque  resque redis_id and resque enqueue to return the same output as the calls to resque queues and resque redis  i e  that resque is unable to connect to redis  my real goal here is to get it working at all when redis is actually running  as it currently silently fails to enqueue a job  even though it appears to have worked 
rails 3 0 4  i am installing resque following the instructions on https   github com defunkt resque 
i've only installed released gems before  do i use something like this in gemfile to get the version you suggest   gem 'resque'   git    'git   github com defunkt resque'
when setting "resque inline true" inside a spec  then running a method that does resque enqueue_at  that job isn't run synchronously as i expected  seems that if i add a job that uses "resque enqueue"  it's properly run inline  just not if i use "enqueue_at"  just wanted to make sure it's working as designed 
thank you  i already checked just know there's process stay 
i submitted one here  https   github com defunkt resque pull 712

yes  i've created a new api only application with no other endpoints  models or controllers configured  after injecting a failed job list into redis i've attempted to clear the failed jobs using the "clear failed jobs" button and get a standard rails routing error   i've also just realised i've posted this in resque rather than resque_web  which may be where the issue actually lies 
i've also noticed this  yeap i think it has to do with the above issue 
yeap no problem  i will do my best 
yes  i looked though the tree briefly and couldn't find any  i suppose i could be blind and not seeing them   
thank you for your response  i found this problem during evaluating my automated testing tool  it happens when the custom address is invalid  reproduce  1  install v6 1 0 from f droid and launch the app  2  click i have a custom server  and input an invalid server address  e g   xx 3  type a username  e g   t 4  type a password  e g   t 5  click register or login  expected  provide a feedback indicating that the address is invalid 
 nathany if it's set in my gemfile lock  i absolutely expect it to install  that's the contract implied by a published artifact  maybe the gem author is wrong  maybe his account gets hacked by a malicious user that yanks everything  maybe the security issue just doesn't apply  maybe the "fixed" gem introduces incompatible changes  in any event  that's all up to a diligent developer to determine whether an upgrade is necessary  not the gem author  this isn't contrived either  i've run into situations where a gem author yanked gems he just thinks were buggy  but which worked perfectly fine for my cases  whereas the upgrade broke other things  i'm rather diligent about auditing libraries to ensure that my installed set works well for my application as is my responsibility as a user of those libraries  i stay up to date on their developments and i evaluate every release before upgrading  so i'm rather confident in my version choices  otherwise i wouldn't lock them down  i should clarify  the issue isn't simply through bundler either  i have projects that i don't use bundler for at all and have been affected by this  a notable case is when bootstrapping my servers i install a fixed release version of bundler itself  the lack of clarity involved is an important issue  but if the answer is having to download and distribute the gem myself  then it hasn't gained me anything other than saving me 3 hours of figuring out that the gem has been yanked and it simply isn't a dns issue or a broken gemfile lock or whatever else  right now  the only way i can really see of avoiding all this is to run my own gem server or fork every gem on github  maybe that's the answer  but it seems like an odd solution when all i'm trying to do is work with previously publicly available libraries 
i am not sure  will do an experiment and follow up 
i don't remember that now  but i think it was from rake release or gem publish command  the  users get page shows a registration form  which we need to get rid of  since there's  users new

it's possible you're looking at the  master  branch in my fork  i'm working in the  provider_options  branch  i did push a couple of commits to master by accident though   the name of the test is  test_google_query_url_contains_bounds  
yes there is a field  previously used a controllador to create new entries in my model and it worked perfect  now i want to use "active admin" does not work  regards
oh alex  that's excellent  works for us  i was actually about to propose something similar 
sure  super easy 
thanks  this works for me  to others with same problem  and as long not merged back to master  there is a typo in the repo name  it '   reinser   '    'reisner'  https   github com alexreisner geocoder commits fix_mongoid_nearbys 
yea i actually tried the hash syntax as well first  my gemfile lock says "geocoder  1 1 3 "
hi alex  we found out the root caused of the problem   it's because of our haproxy server does not forward the public id to the rails server  it instead forwards its ip address   local ip   we fixed it by adding these lines in the haproxy config file
the branch you supplied works flawlessly so far  i'll now throw it into our deployment pipeline to see if there are any issues  but so far it looks good 
i am  i'm going to create a new app from scratch with one model  i'll try debugging the response as well 
 alexreisner postgressql
alex  i've been able to identify this as an error in our codebase  interestingly the error didn't crop up until we made the upgrade to 1 2 9  we were using a custom lookup in our model that hard coded to  bing unless a custom lookup was defined on an attribute on the model  then this lookup falls back to  test on our test environment 
with any  result  you should be either able to set override the locale  currently result  is hard coded to use the system default locale  see  https   github com alexreisner geocoder blob master lib geocoder results geoip2 rb#l57

i'm assuming it doesn't work because github in page previews use redcarpet  rather than kramdown  per the gemfile in this repo  described as "the code we use to render readme your_favorite_markup"  which i can't confirm as i can't run github locally   so  a solution might be for gh to move to using kramdown for in page previews

 patrickatamaniuk we will try to test it during the day  thanks a lot  we do not use the velocity based estimate that much  usually we use remaining time and estimate more  the story points we do not use that well either  i would love to use it though  we use estimated time and remaining time more  regarding the loading of backlogs page i cannot really say since that was not our major concern  but for sure i think it is loading faster than before  but not much as i see it  at least not in our set up  i will let you know once we have tested the latest master 
we're still on backlogs v0 9 26  i reported nonetheless as the code hadn't changed in newer revisions or master  the fixes look good  i'll report back once i've tested them  that might not be until tomorrow though  thanks

i've tried setting it at the start of the js document  i've also tried it inside the initcallback but the value is always returned as null  all i want to do is make sure that if the item with the li id "active" is outwith the visible range it will be moved into the visible range when the carousel instance is rendered 
unfortunately  the site is offline  i'm testing it for the moment   the html looks like this    div id "lastcomments"   h2 commentaires r eacute cents  h2   ul id "carousel lastcomments"   li   ul   li  span class "left"  a href " post 2010 04 17 phasellus latinus#c652" paul   strange day  a   span  span class "right" 10 04 17  span   li   li blablabla     same code as before  in fact   li   li blablabla     same code as before  in fact   li   li blablabla     same code as before  in fact   li   li blablabla     same code as before  in fact   li    ul    li   li   ul   li blablabla  li   li blablabla  li   li blablabla  li   li blablabla  li   li blablabla  li    ul    li    ul    div  i hope this helps    if you need the generted code  i mean   the source code including the code added by jcarousel   please let me know  thanx for your help

hi there   it's not public at the moment and a bit of a beast to recreate an example of  i'll try and explain better as the situation has changed somewhat   i have a horizontal carousel with li elements that when clicked upon expands  horizontally to the right  and reloads the carousel  got this working   the next previous controls update as expected taking into account the new width of the ul which is great  however  as well as expanding the item  i manually center the item by moving the jcarousel ul's left offset  this ofcourse means that the controls are not aware of the offset change  i realise that jcarousel does not currently support a pixel offset parameter but was wondering whether you can think of an easy way to extend a method or something to get the next previous controls to take the pixel offset into account  your help is much appreciated as the carousel works perfectly otherwise  uses nested carousels for each element also  and i would loathe to change it at this stage

tlsa for ssh wouldn't work because most sysadmins run ssh on a nonstandard port  "security by obscurity"  and they want their ssh port to not be published on a tlsa record  for a hacker to discover the target system's ssh port  the hacker has to do a port scan on it  and the target system should detect the port scan i e  a remote user is trying to connect x times to closed ports within y seconds  and ban the hacker for z minutes for doing the port scan  allowing the sysadmin to notice the remote user is a hacker  before the hacker can discover the ssh port and attempt to login

i think calling  abstractmethoderror initcause e   would be the correct solution  unless  abstractmethoderror  already sets the  cause  for some weird reason 
 stevenschlansker i'm not expecting anything but just wanting to indicate that each call will scan all methods of the interface  if there are many methods for this interface  this will have an impact on performance 
as far as i found out the reason seems to be a bit of a design flaw  a  handle  creates a threadlocal for its config in its constructor  now  if a  lazyhandlesupplier  is used  in its  inithandle    method the  lazyhandlesupplier  overwrites this threadlocal of a  handle  via a package private setter  this setter is only used there and its only reason seems to be to support the  lazyhandlesupplier   thing is  the  lazyhandlesupplier  also handles the clean up of the threadlocals that itself has set to the  handle  by this setter  seems good  it handles the things it created  but if the  handle  is not managed by a  lazyhandlesupplier   as is the case when using jdbi withhandle   method   the threadlocal  created by the  handles  constructor  is never destroyed in the  handles   close    method  problem is  as soon as the  handle  will destroy its own threadlocals created in its constructor  it also would destroy the threadlocals that are set by the  lazyhandlesupplier  and therefor  handle  would possibly affect  lazyhandlesuppliers  internal state  that's the flaw i was talking about  hope i'm on the right track and this helps to fix the issue  please let me know

it should be string_list everywhere  i changed the name in between  sorry about that  i fixed it now  i was able to circumvent the problem by disabling statement caching in the connection pool  this is my connection pool now 
i'm not sure making program flow  exception and its content  dependent on something as architecturally distant and conceptually different as log levels is a good idea  additionally  log level typically varies based on class and package  i would argue that to cut out the sql would be the most logical first step   generally  you know what sql a certain line of code produces  and the majority of sql errors stem  i would think  from problematic parameter values  at least  other than during active development  but even just logging parameters is problematic when it comes to huge batch  insert  statements  for example  i would vote for a staggered level of exception filling  none  parameters  statement   configurable on both jdbi and handle objects  most issues i can think of with excessive error message size stem from them actually reaching the logging facility  possibly an alternative approach would be to add the error content as a separate field to the jdbi exception s  that an interested party can get via  exception getwhateveritsnamed     and then process in any manner they please   log  discard  truncate  handle differently based on size  we dealt with a similar problem in the past by writing error messages exceeding a certain size to separate text files and logging merely the filename instead  
aaah  sorry  i installed via pypi a few weeks ago  before 0 9 5 was uploaded 
yes  i am using the default channel for everything   presumably this is bad  my base code is here  https   gist github com 4669710 i followed the rabbitmq tutorial  could you please point me to a better example  my callback function is passed in  and the messages are a list of json objects that are produced by the producer and consumed by the consumer  thanks  on jan 29  2013  at 8 07 pm  nathan lundquist notifications github com wrote 
version is 0 9 12
and 0 01 milliseconds comes down to not waiting at all  which is what makes this a busy loop with pika essentially doing polling at an insanely high frequency 
forgot to mention  very important note  we have a context manager  where   enter     creates the blockingconnection and the channels  and the   exit     calls blockingconnection stop    it seems to fail only when there's an exception in the with block  but not always   operating system where pika was used  mac ubuntu14 04 debian8 pika version  or whether you're using pika from pika master branch   latest 0 10 0 rabbitmq version  3 6 1  erlang 18 2  debug level log from pika for the affected period  attached in the end  rabbitmq log for the affected period  attached in the end  about hanging for quiet a while  sometimes it finishes normally after a minute or two  sometimes it fails on timeout of heartbeat  as in the log in the bottom   sometimes it doesn't finish until i kill it manually  about pipes being clogged  in my tests  i only send one message that makes the system stop  the handle function throws an intentional exception  which makes the with block exit  which calls stop   so   there should be no more than at most 1 message unprocessed  i tried canceling and then closing each connection one by one  and the same happens  it seems to get stuck on "cancel" of one of the connections  not necessarily the first one    actually the traceback above is from just such a test   important note  i might have made a huge mistake  as i said  the code is very complex  and it uses threads in some areas  i just noticed that it actually does one of the consumes in a separate thread  it might be the case that if that thread still consumes  we get the problem  sorry for wasting

sorry  open build service is the system which produces packages for  among other  opensuse linux distribution  i am a general maintainer of python packages there  which is the reason why i got in contact with pika package  the page of the package on obs is https   build opensuse org package show devel languages python python pika   yes  i guess it uses vms  but generally they shouldn't be too slow  we build all opensuse packages there  and i don't think we have too many timeout related problems  
do you mean upgrade to perl 5 10 
hi  i've never tried to query escalations via livestatus  but i would expect the name is the same as the host service  the notification command   but this was a stupid idea       
 sorry for my bad english  why when i want to generated a report with reports cgi if the state of the host is indeterminate  nagios  in the availability report i can see 100  available    i think unknown or inderterminate state must be use   
i'v installed thruk 1 62 1 rhel6 x86_64 rpm  the problem is both with firefox and crome i'll install thruk 1 66 2 rhel6 x86_64 rpm and check agaign
i run multiple instances of nagios per host  so my action_url includes 'more than' just pnp4nagios to identify itself  my action_url settings have this format  for hosts  http    _hostworker_hostname  pnp4nagios  _hostworker_instance  graph host  hostname  srv _host_ for services  http    _hostworker_hostname  pnp4nagios  _hostworker_instance  graph host  hostname  srv  servicedesc  which translate to strings like this inside the interface  for hosts  http   nagios01 hostname com pnp4nagios instance1 graph host  hostname  srv _host_ for services  http   nagios01 hostname com pnp4nagios instance1 graph host  hostname  srv  servicedesc  therefore  i have the following inside my thruk_local conf 
on the comment text box  spacebar is disabled   thruk  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1348501 8548691 2b930388 24be 11e5 846d 077b47347374 jpg 
as far as i could make out the details  it's because sound alarms are triggered by the status totals and not by the status details  and the status totals don't use the complete filter  host  serviceprops aren't considered 
thruk is 2 20 2   mysql is 5 5 60 0+deb8u1 it's all running on openvz container with debian 8 10 i often notice that logcacheclean is actually running well into the day  despite starting at night  something is fairly misconfigured  maybe it's a mysql problem 
hi sni  it's a sla service report type  here is a print screen of one of those reports     sla report type  https   user images githubusercontent com 30077152 38991773 0dd831ae 43df 11e8 9e03 883949bdaf52 jpg  and this is the error     sla report type error  https   user images githubusercontent com 30077152 38991865 4eb22b76 43df 11e8 89bf fa15722c3126 jpg 
on our system it currently fails on any page i tried so far   
i'm using thruk on debian  i installed it by apt 
an example could be create some objects with type person with some parameters and see if all a sequence of test run in less than 10 seconds
definitely   i'll cook up something this weekend

hi  i use junit 4 11 an example can be found here  https   gist github com thogaw 6125767
hmm i'm on a tight schedule right now and i don't have your source code checked out  however if i can spare some time i will do so  thanks for the reply 
i am sorry  please explain why it is not an anti pattern  the catch clause just returns null instead of handling or re throwing the exception  it swallows the exception losing the information forever 
i am currently running them from ide only   using them with ui automation testing selenium   i want to run them in parallel only  but along with reports  can you please suggest  if possible using current junit or i need to fork it 
we run the tests parameterized so that the parameters are read from external configuration files  each test method is run from 1 to n times  where n changes based on the content of the external parameter file   for example  one test might have the input value a   1 and expected output value of b    2 and another test the input value a   2 and expected output value of b    1  when a test method is e g  configured to run twice  with different parameters   eclipse displays "runs  2 1"  displaying the correct total number of tests would not only be more aesthetically pleasing  but would give the user some expected information about how long the tests are going to run 
yes they do  so far i've created a workaround in my solution  the supersuite is unchanged  under it there is myparameterized extending parameterized and under it are myparameterizedrunners extending blockjunit4class  myparameterizedrunners have fields and setters for them  then i overrided myparametrized's method getchildren   this basically allows me to put required fields into myparameterizedrunner  but it would be much better if this could be somehow possible to achieve via factory class   myparameterizedrunner's constructor 
in the case of our own code and our own tests  we already use  doprivileged  in any locations which i'm aware of  but even if we weren't  we give our own code permission to read any system property  actually  we give junit the permission to read any system property as well  but _because it isn't using  doprivileged _  callers further down the stack get checked as well  and apparently no matter what we put into the security policy  those ones can't be marked as trusted  we use the security manager to stop code  both libraries and our own code  since this is a testing framework  it seems reasonable to get extra checking for free where possible   doing various things we don't want them to do  but mostly to stop them writing data outside of where we tell them to or exiting the jvm  yeah  it has actually happened before     the former could theoretically be done by writing a custom nio2 filesystem which wraps the real filesystem  but it would be a lot of work to make it support absolutely everything the real one supports  the latter is impossible to do any other way  at least as far as i am aware 
not that i am aware of  i built both from sources as external dependencies of apache ant and junit 4 built without problems  however  i did not check this explicitly 
no  i don’t  setting up the necessary ide that exactly follows your coding conventions doesn’t seem time efficient to me 
jup  thanks 
ok  kcooney i will jump your hoops but if i can't reproduce it in simpler form are you at least willing to look at this problem and see if you can see something that can help 
no  only on maven  on a non maven project i don't have this issue

thanks for pointing me to  bottle request environ   to construct the right url  two elements were missing  the correct url scheme and the proxied domain name   bottle request environ 'http_host'   and  bottle request environ 'server_name'   both have the correct value for the proxied domain name so that can be used  but no dict item indicates a https request  notably   wsgi url_scheme  has the value 'http' in both cases  the only difference between the ssl proxy environ and the regular environ are extra  http_via  and  http_x_forwarded_ server host for   keys  again no sign of https there  so this looks more like a problem with my ssl proxy provider than a bug with bottle  i just have to tell my script that the scheme is "https" if the  http_x_forwarded_server  value is my ssl proxy server  for bottle  i don't know if it makes sense to have bottle request url   accept user input for non standard environ values

just to ping this  i am still having this issue after upgrading to bottle 0 12 8 
yes  that's the first line of code that gets executed 
bottle probably run cli app of gunicorn when server option is set to gunicorn

i don't  got it to raise an error 
what should be the code for this
i'll give it a shot  from what you say  it sounds like if user data is included in an area that is restricted to latin 1  then it should be properly encoded into latin 1 with escapes  rather than being assumed to be latin 1  i know about the url restrictions  i'm less clear on what parts of the response might have other restrictions  without the error condition  the request is properly handled    so it seems that the error is in the error path  not the success path

hi  expected is that there is no warning displayed about new global vars  in firefox and chrome this happens  in opera it displays the error that there are new global vars  you can see it happen here  http   js linux nl javascript linux test html noglobals true in some cases it happens in the first test  in some cases in the second test  it changes on a refresh   the mentioned globals are not from my code at all  the code in that specif test is here  https   github com paul999 javascript linux blob master tests general js
attached code for testing the above issue   phantomjs  https   gist github com 4685298  and  qunit  https   gist github com 4685299  files 
i have karma watching my files and running a test suite whenever i change a file  it is super handy  because i never have to leave a text editor    just save a file and watch tests being executed  the problem arises when a test suite becomes large and slow to run  source based test filtering solves this problem   here is a nice post about the topic  http   tobyho com 2012 09 12 better tdd workflow via exclusive tests in jasmine and mocha  
i've just installed it as dependency of another project with  npm install qunitjs   save dev   i suposse that not being installed directly that's the reason why it hasn't installed the dev dependencies and so it's why it didn't created the dist qunit js file  anyway  i'm currently using the ones from qunit  folder without problems  so what's the reason of grunt and the dist  file 
running 1 15 0  i'll check this again when 1 16 0 comes out 
glad it seems please you  you can play with the online demo http   demo angelozerr rhcloud com codemirror java qunit html which uses the qunit tern plugin with web browser codemirror  done with https   github com angelozerr qunitjs com commit 10a329951c331192568e5ca59c9468cf2a346871
for now  i would be happy with a stop execution that just stops everything and the user can re run the test if they want to  maybe a pause could be implemented but i was envisioning the "simpler" just stop the world with this one 
 trentmwillis the difference is variable scope and grouping it's like a comment in reddit which could be subcomment and subsubcomment  that's the main point  to split it in difference module then it cannot reuse variable i got from the previous test  get userids properly is also a test that i do assert  another use case is to test many items that could be test each one asynchronously  ability to asynchronous test each block will be neat  i test 3 user separately and want to display result of test in its own block  but when i do async it was race against each other and report flat result  indently group is better 
thanks   leobalter  for the quick reply  a few more bullets about my setup    i'm using qunit + requirejs   there are nested modules  e g  parent module is "static content" and child module is "side bar"   i'd like the hooks applied in the parent context and reused for each child module and its child tests    all child tests within a parent module act on a shared global widget bound to the  #qunit fixture  element which is setup in the  before  hook and torn down in the  after  hook    understood that tests should be atomic  but in this case the setup teardown cost for what i'm testing is larger so for performance reasons  i want to set it up once and tear it down once  i'm guessing i'm running into amd weirdness or global state weirdness  or a combination of the two  which is to say  not a qunit issue after all  but an issue w the complexity of my setup   any hints you can provide would still be appreciated if my setup sounds like one you have experience with 
i believe we have seen this in both 0 11 and 0 12

well  i didn't have problems fetching with 2 5 1 so i guess they fixed that  still  i downgraded to 1 9 5 to see if that works  i'm running the same command again  i'll let you know when it's over  i have to ask  what was gittfs doing when it crashed in my case  c40918 is the last changeset in the tfs repository  so it seems to me that git tfs ran to completion successfully  then crashed while post processing something 
 spraints  no  as i stated  i closed the solution  i'm unsure if source control bindings are enabled  in the visual studio status bar  even when the solution is closed  i see the currently checked out git branch  when working on the solution  team explorer shows me git related stuff since i'm working in a "git" repo  not a tfs local workspace   is this enough information 
sorry  i wasn't clear enough  i mean documenting a list possible actions for   as described here https   github com git tfs git tfs blob master doc special actions in commit messages md
no it didn't  that is why i am confused about that  i checked the code and debugged it  but i just couldn't find the reason   
i would like to run it as a synchronization service between a git repo and tfsvc repo 
hi content is is different in whole lines files not line endings this migration is 55000 changsets i will run git tfs verify and report back
perfect man  i saw your branch but didn't suppose a play module until your response  but i was knowing you made jqvalidator before       i've remembered hardwired demo from amiga days after i see your company name  crionics 
i don't understand why i have to start the java server and actually i'm using php sorry if this comment looks stupid
from the w3c markup validation service  http   validator w3 org  and from the xhtml schema   xs attribute name "class" type "xs nmtokens"   http   www w3 org tr 2000 wd xml 2e 20000814#nt nmtoken
yes  exactly as the demo  function fields field  rules  i  options      optional funccall       it separately works
i have several forms where i use validationengine to validate for example a birthdate  if i use custom date  as it is  it doesn't correctly validate the input and allows dates like 2001 75 32 which are clearly invalid  but pass as correct  i just noticed  the markdown modified my post  i should be correct now  best regards mariano
the original field's hook just doesn't work  see  http   stackoverflow com questions 5838131 jquery plugin validationengines hook not executing
when i use this it works    "#inforeservierungen"  validationengine "hide"   when i use this    "#inforeservierungen"  validationengine "updatepromptsposition"   wich is a paramter from your example list  my error console's output says  »method updatepromptsposition does not exist in jquery validationengine« hope that helps 
the field code was   input name "phone" type "number" id "phone" class "validate required  text input"    i may be missing something in the validation maybe  when submitting with no value in the phone field the error message does not appear  incidentally i've decided not to use the type number option as it doesn't seem to handle phone numbers with spaces very well 
i downloaded the zipfile in the download section  some how it returns date btw 1915 and 1920 years  i debugged it and found the return line was the culprit in the parse method  thanks   regards  vineel sonnathi on dec 22  2011  at 17 28  olivier refalo reply reply github com wrote 
hi olivier  you don't understand what i mean  here are 2 reasosn  1  http get requests are not limited by rfc but usually limited by different applications  e g  ie's limit is 2083 characters  2  when you send form by get request  it sends field values in url and that's bad  especially for password fields  because these urls can be stored in different log files  e g  apache access log so forms that contain login name and password better to send using post because nobody write post data into log files  yes   type  form prop 'method'   would be great  my form is simple 
ggplot2_0 8 9 and lubridate_1 2 0  you are correct  i updated and it works fine now  sorry for the confusion 
yes  better go with the standard  just reviewed the standard  i would say if you can add support like    z  would just means utc time  same with  with_tz  and  tz   this is very helpful as in my work we often just record the shift  easy to parse as numbers  instead of the name of the time zones  also a tiny utility function to convert between name of time zone and the shift could also be useful sometimes  excellent work on the package  i like it a lot 
this is very hacky  but the function would have functionality like this for data frames  which i imagine would be its primary use case   and something similar for date vectors  could be generalized to handle weekly monthly annual data 
version is 1 3 3  current cran version  i have used this as a workaround 
hi  vspinu and sorry if i wasn't precise enough  i'm looking for a way to map a particular  week of the year  to the correct  month of the year  and have drafted an example function  weekstomonth  below   as this seems to be a hard one with no easy answer  for windows os and german locale  at least   i also posted to  r help  which possibly gives you even more background information  http   r 789695 n4 nabble com match iso 8601 week of year numbers to month of year numbers on windows with german locale td4728059 html

sorry for the delay  but i don't have my ubuntu maverick at hand anymore  but the issue is present with arch linux as well  today  24 nov 2010  i updated the whole system  installed sinatra and tried again  i get the same results as i already described    lang  is  de_de utf8     lc_ctype  is empty   sorry for the backslash in uname  a   #1   but github's flavored markdown expands it to a   a   otherwise that doesn't get linked because of the code block and therefore shows up as   a href     1  a      marvin
i have installed it  but i get the following  ruby  s gem which sinatra ruby  no such file or directory    gem  loaderror 
sure 
no problem  https   github com rtomayko tilt issues 88
don't know  could be a rainbows   thread thing

thanks for listing out what is currently available  already quite useful  that said  i don't think the   layout  needs to be relative to a single views folder _at all _ perhaps i'm doing something wrong on my side  but trying to do something like      results in sinatra returning a  no such file or directory  error for the layout  because it's trying to append that path to the views path  i feel like i should be able to do the above without any interlock between the views folder and where my layouts live 
it's explained in the  mustache readme  https   github com defunkt mustache   here's  the view  https   github com sunny gollum commit 646b4fd19df6a350c9344fcdab46f1a20739937a#l10r14  that's being used in #359 
well  it's not much  but here it goes   this is the redirection endpoint i give to a certain oauth service  therefore it comes with some additional parameters  namely  the authorization code   the 'stuff' part is basically me requesting the token  persisting it  and then i want to redirect to ' '  my homepage  but the endpoint is not ' '  but ' #code blblablalbalbal expires something'  namely  the parameters given to my ' connect' endpoint  i hope this code sample is enough  but maybe jtarchie is right  and that has to do with the web server  i'm using thin  by the way 
it does indeed work  which issue was fixed 
sure  here is my site rb   if i move  not_found  block inside of my  sinatra  base  subclass  this route stops working 
ya  like i said  not sure if this is a sinatra issue  i will check with jeremy about sequel  and see what he says   
solved by this  thanks sudo apt get   purge remove ruby rvm sudo rm  rf  usr share ruby rvm  etc rvmrc  etc profile d rvm sh  curl  l https   get rvm io   bash  s stable   ruby   autolibs enable   auto dotfiles sudo gem install rdoc sudo gem install sinatra
i ended up updating the gemset and the issue disappeared 
 rennex i had exhausted all those avenues  however  i went and checked now and i noticed that  even after restarting puma  the process associated with its socket was always the same  so i killed that process  restarted puma  and now the updates are reflecting  if it happens again  i will see if i can take the issue up with the puma team  maybe there is something in their documentation that i missed  thanks for your help 
some steps to reproduce the issue were missing  fair enough  1   generate post request body 
fixed     sudo killall ruby   i had another puma server running on that port without knowing 
can you confirm that you received the email 
damn that was fast  d
gemfile seems to be locked at 6c713e585c24ba0ed2d58a2571489af12c1a309b i am not entirely sure that was the exact revision at the time of testing but i did start with the latest release gem at the time  i now have it working with manually specified endpoint and namespace but as i had other weirdness along the way i am not 100  certain that they are required for the thing to work 
it appears as if it was fixed in the 0 9 7 release  thanks 
i got it working for documentation on your website under the multi part branch  great software 
you can find the service wsdl here  https   gist github com 1178449 at the moment i use the following workaround for my soap body definition 
https   gist github com freakyfelt e9137d76065604c1d475
hi  i believe i gave it on my original post   i tested in using irb  require 'savon' wsdl   'https   test com' #not the real end point client   savon client wsdl  wsdl  ssl_cert_file  'test pem'  ssl_cert_key_password  'xxxx'  client operations output  d   2013 05 17t09 34 44 144174 #82541  debug      httpi get request to xxxxx  net_http  httpi  sslerror  ssl_connect returned 1 errno 0 state sslv3 read finished a  sslv3 alert bad certificate maybe just wrong syntax 
i resolved this issue by installing gem 'httpclient'  thanks 
 tjarratt thank you for getting back to me  i understand why the tns invoke is included as it is the only valid operation specified by my wsdl  i do not think this is a bug with savon2 and am just asking for some help in building the request  how can i construct a request like i talked about in my original question and then send it to my endpoint  "http   servername port pingservice"   all the examples i have found are using the client request   method that i believe are supported in savon1 but not savon2  i'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this to but help in figuring out how to send the request would help me out immensely  thank you for your time 
 tjarratt  this is an interesting approach  wrapping the client  i have started using the models approach outlines in the github page   first  is this something you would shy away from in favor of creating the client in the initializer  similar to the approach you outlined above  second  if i go with your recommendation  wrapping the client  how would that affect the model approach i pasted above 
 tjarratt thanks for the answer  business postponed adding this feature  so i had to leave it  if i will have problems in future i will reopen issue    you may close it  thanks 
thanks  tjarratt   this works 
it's not working with the latest version too  in  modelviz py    _unrelated _ also  it does  app __name__  to get the name of the app in the lines after but with  appconfig  it could be just  app name   if app is an  appconfig  
seems like threaded or not threaded still caused the issue  something about chrome on osx is off  but it doesn't seem to be django extensions related  so i'll close the ticket  thanks again for the great library work 
error occurred using python 3 4 with  django  1 7c2    psycopg2  2 5 3   and  django extensions  1 3 10  installed from pypi  after installing current master  reset_db  results in 
create a model with unique true on some fields  sync it  manually remove all constraints and indexes from db  use postgresql 
 chid that does a  delete   which could be slower  and does not reset primary key indexes  which makes it harder to setup my test database that uses explicit indexes 
sure thing  i'll try to tackle that within the next week 
yes i meant  validate_templates  and the files exist in the file system 
because i'm not that clever     i was thinking because i needed somewhere to stuff my  ##     other beuracracy  code  which manipulates the object under test first before testing equivalence identity   but i see that  all equal  takes        so maybe i can stuff that code into a custom  all equal  method  thanks for the insight  i'll noodle on this a bit more    
i don't have the dev version  but i'll give that a shot  i don't understand #851 very well yet  but i don't   think   it's the same problem   in my case the end result is a "failure to fail"  succeeds when it shouldn't   whereas it looks like in #851 it was failing correctly but just not soon enough 
for example create a temporary file before each  test_that  and remove it after 
hmm  that might be a handy feature too  the issue is that i'm using testthat outside of its intended use case  i'm checking files with it  and things like "you're a coding rockstar" do not make sense in that context 
thanks hadley thats a good idea  i will have a think how that may work with my particular package 
sure  i was thinking something like the following  though you may imagine a more elegant construction  
 jdshkolnik according to the documentation and the news messages  i think your code should work  but it doesn't work for me 
looking through the blame  i got back to  this commit  https   github com r lib testthat commit 767f1dc314464b1676928d025fd811c80ed3c763   i don't see anything in there that explains why  test_dir    would have a different default  that and the linked issue look like they're just related to documentation   if you can't recall a reason for them having different defaults  i recommend we change the default to  true  
sure  hadley  here's the patrick implementation code  https   github com google patrick blob master r with_parameters r#l58 and some examples of how i'm currently using this  e g  in my basejump package   https   github com acidgenomics basejump search q with_parameters_test_that unscoped_q with_parameters_test_that
result is same  that is problem  dump  this  getreflection    getfilename       projecta app in projecta  b     
i am using version 2 1  but this is also happening in 2 0 when i use  mailer  send  message   in 2 0 method send   in message do  this  getmailer    send  this  build     so it was ok if you use it in way  message  send    need to change protected method build   to public  to use  mailer  send  message  build    or change behavior of sendmailmailer  problem of sendmailmailer 
sorry i probably missed the first notification  yes it's working correctly with v2 2 2  good work and thanks 
done  not closing this issue untill bower has updated new git endpoint   it has to be done manually by them

thanks for the suggestion  i'm not comfortable with my _main_ ssh key  not having a passphrase  http   help github com working with key passphrases   but i really wanna use backup  so  as you suggested  i created another ssh key and i omitted the passphrase   i'll only use this new key for connecting to my backup server—not for connecting to all the other servers i work with—so that lessens the security concern significantly   then i followed  this tip  http   help github com multiple keys #configuring_ssh  for using multiple ssh keys on the same system  this solves the problem  scp via backup now works from the command line and via cron  thanks 
 mongodump  continues to take a    db  parameter  so that's fine  i'm just talking about  mongo   which is called when   in order to perform the locking unlocking before and after 
i agree that validating file names should be done  and i believe it is _now_  these files are from a 5+ year old rails app and there have been a ton of file uploads over that time  perhaps it might be possible for backup to fail somewhat less spectacularly and identify the file that is causing the issue

hello  sorry for the late reply  i checked first if the same issue is noticeable on your demo pages and as it was a yes  i reported it thinking it as a bug  but as i am checking it now  i am not able to reproduce the same issue on your examples  but yes  the effect is big on my site but only on ie  by the way  i found a discussion on stackoverflow at http   bit ly 14ywyst   thinking of implementing the same  also  a great lightbox plugin  have been using this wherever the need arises  thanks

i'm trying to create a cron job to send a pdf through e mail  at the moment the user goes to the page  clicks the export to pdf button  wicked_pdf than convertsthe html page to pdf  they save it locally to there hard drive and attach to the e mail  i would like to automate this  have the ruby script go through the database  get what it needs  look at a template or view html file  create and send the pdf

i use max os x as development environment and ubuntu 10 04 as production  my wkhtmltopdf's version is 0 9 9 from the gem wkhtmltopdf binary  i have tried to get the newest version of souce and compiled it by hand and put it in  usr local bin and point this into the initializer   with this way wicked_pdf even could not work to generate a pdf  i think it should be the fonts problem of wkhtmltopdf as you said same issue with prawn  you should setup the font before generate chinese character   i would try your solution later and let you know the result 
i didn't know about this shortcut  so i forked the project in order to do that  but here is what's raising the exception   it seems that some method is encapsulated in a timeout block  no information  however  about what caused that 
i submitted a ticket with wkhtmltopdf as well 
the reason i wanted wicked_pdf to "wrap" the existing pdf is because it's on s3  but i've resolved that issue  i will bookmark these links should i need them  thanks 
yes using wkhtmltopdf_binary version 0 9 6 ubuntu 12 04
version 3 2 20
this is the direct code from my app   the assets are on cloudfront on the staging server  while on the development server  they are served by rails  that might be the problem  ideas 
sorry to take so long to get around to giving a working example  i have forked wicked_pdf_issues  added a test case and done a pull request 
 unixmonkey threading as the culprit might be a good suggestion considering the randomness of the errors   the error occurs on heroku when  seemingly  it's the only process on the dyno  locally i use the same procfile and run two workers using  heroku local  and cannot replicate  i've tried with 10 workers locally and a handful of documents at once  no errors  i'll try unicorn  here's my procfile 
 unixmonkey when the new instance is generated that time it will pull the latest code from master branch  and run necessary commands like bundle install  rake db migrate and etc 
no  i did not find a workaround  if anyone has a clue  he is welcomed

hello  it is exactly the same problem  bootsrtap ui   windows 7   both chrome 60 and firefox 54  as before your fix on 3 aug  see related comments on #779    i have reproduced the problem using my old  example  https   github com tonytomov jqgrid files 1291974 index txt  on #779 using your latest build

hmpf   chros73 i am using the git for windows distribution 😛 i don't have time right now  especially not to hunt down a bug that i only encountered today when i tried to upgrade the  tig  included in git for windows  but i will try to find some time  and not to forget about it  
i used the default configuration  for reproduce    compile tig with this patch    in tig select  news adoc  and hold '1' key for stage lines   for me tig crashed after stage 71 lines
i'm on 1 0 2  i think the issue is that at  django_filters line 103  https   github com carltongibson django filter blob 1 0 0 django_filters rest_framework backends py#l103   no  schema  is specified  which leaves it at  none   in the  drf doc template  https   github com encode django rest framework blob master rest_framework templates rest_framework docs link html#l46   it tries to display  field schema description   which fails because  field schema  is  none   should i move this to drf  or do you think there's something to be done here  i can patch if we agree on a solution 
i think i meant to ask if it exists a filter backend that can handle url regex variables  or if it is even possible to write one
it did  but it was kind of hack  i looked to the code to see how it is implemented and then take advantage of how it is implemented "under the hood"  however  my first try was using  field_order  and i was surprise that it did not work  if other people are happy about using the workaround and you don't see any value changing there is no problem  just opened the issue because of my own experience
i'm so sorry but i had an brain fart  solved it in a prettier way already  thxs for the quick comment 
you can spec the queryset  but because you can chain querysets  it gets annoying to spec the mock that will actually be passed to this filter  e g   you end up needing to track the exact chain of calls on the queryset prior to the filter_queryset   method and mock something like  mock_qs all return_value filter return_value distinct return_value   mock spec queryset  it's not impossible  but it is fragile  could the assert be changed to a logging error instead  or implemented as a type hint

 scambra right  sorry about that  this is the problem with trying to keep everything updated when following head of master  anyway  changing   resource invitation_token  to   token  didn't work because   token  is always nil for me  did i miss another change  i'm at devise version 3 1 and devise_invitable fb71e7ca15ec
oh yes  i found a part of code which overrides the deliver_invitation method and calls invitation_instructions self  with just one  now i see it accepts token as well  i need to take care of that  thanks    apologies for the troubles
thanks for the response    i am sending it with put   should i just take away "   html      method     put " and it should work

i think i've sorted out what cause of the problem is here  within my application controller  i have a  before_action  which only fires for devise controllers  this method updates the timezone for the current resource  why the  invitation_token  gets overwritten is because of an update call made within this action where the  invitation_token  has been set to the  raw_invitation_token   this boils down to setting the  invitation_token  as the raw value in a  #edit  https   github com scambra devise_invitable blob master app controllers devise invitations_controller rb#l42  and being accepted as an permitted attribute in the  #update  https   github com scambra devise_invitable blob master app controllers devise invitations_controller rb#l84  action's  parameters  https   github com scambra devise_invitable blob master lib devise_invitable parameter_sanitizer rb#l25   the fault of this on me for updating a record on a get when it has unpersisted changes  however  i wouldn't expect these values to be set by a get either  closing 
i tried 1 6 7 with 2 4 0 and 2 2 0  the oldest option   i'm extracting 1 6 5 now and will give it a try 
hi there  i'm using mosquitto for os x and i have tried to subscribe from my terminal and retained messages are received in my terminal  so i guess there is nothing wrong with the broker  is there any special tricks so that we can receive retained messages 
ah ok  i edited the define in the source file and it now accepts my larger message
i'm using thingspeak  i think i could request the logs via their forums  but no easy access  however  i went ahead and moved the client loop   to occur more frequently and that seems to have fixed the issue  is running that command every loop too frequent  i don't want to ddos them 
trying to send data in azure cloud
this is the code  as i said it works perfect when the wifi is reset  but only if the wifi was on at the startup of the esp8266  when i get to this part of the code client connected   shows that the esp8266 is not connected  but is connected because is publishing messages  if  client connected         attempt to connect if  client connect con_client_id  _user  _password  con_topic  0  false  con_offline     resuscripcion    wifi_status      else   serial print "failed  rc "   serial println client state        
is a library that wraps pubsubclient  in pubsubclient cpp in the connect function  this  domain  is something strange  this not happens if i hard code the ip  i've debbuged and print domain field everywhere in the code and the problem is appearing only in the connect function  this is the suspicious scope 
hmm i was running 2 26 0   updated  and now it works   thanks 
cheers  that is interesting  see edit for my versions   text_field should support text and password inputs and textareas  removing textareas would be a pretty major change

yes it's not happening in chrome  on fri 9 nov  2018  9 18 pm justin ko  notifications github com wrote 
 p0deje if i opened this issue  it is not about me not being able to do what i want to achieve  i also provided myself with a different solution to my problem  this issue was meant to make the use of watir #attribute method more "general"  when watir contains the below in  element_locator_spec rb    it "handles selector with attribute presence" do    expect_one  xpath  "      data view "    locate_one   data_view  true     end  it lets the user define a key locator as described  then why not treat that key locator as any other  if there is any good argument against it  then i would say it should fire up an error otherwise it becomes confusing for a newbie like me at least 
something like this   issue with  expires if remove it line   this error fixed
 sigmavirus24   macos x 10 8
django jenkins is calling pep8 internally as a task so i cannot directly add parameters  i didn't know about that mailing list  thanks for the hint 
indeed  i fixed it  there is no space on the first line  here is the full code  but a file with only the snippet in my first post ehibit the same behavior  https   github com enkore i3pystatus pull 146
 sigmavirus24 yes  that should work  your clarifying phrase is correct  i myself write long nested functions and would appreciate the ability to turn this inspection on and off  it is only when using callback based libraries that i find myself using dozens of very short closure functions  side note 1  perhaps this error is more closely associated with the pep 8 rule "use blank lines in functions  sparingly  to indicate logical sections " after all   long  nested functions could be considered "logical sections"  side note 2  the inspection only seems to notice blank lines missing _above_ the nested function  it seems to me more logical to check for a blank line both above and below  as this looks much cleaner when separating long nested functions  side note 3  it is actually my ide  intellij with python  pycharm plugin  that is  using pep8  http   blog jetbrains com pycharm 2013 02 long awaited pep 8 checks on the fly improved doctest support and more in pycharm 2 7   in their inspections  it lets me easily disable  enable specific pep8 errors 
so we're using flake8 to lint our python and it's being run inside of a ci that i believe doesn't have the version of python our application is using † and so it errors like so   hence we added  # flake8  noqa  e999  to resolve the issue as we know it's not a syntax error † to explain  we have a mono repo  where each directory is a different service  and our application has moved some of its modules into a 'shared' directory so other apps can use that code  the problem there is that we have two ci's  one ci uses docker to run our app and its tests linter etc with the relevant and correct environment √ the other ci doesn't use docker and uses python 2 instead of python 3 which our app uses and it runs its own integration tests against all the 'services'  i e  directories within our mono repo 
i have started a separate project for that  https   github com sobolevn flake8 parenthesis
indeed  i got the idea from flake8 tabs  which i noticed adds this information  but  unless you want to use tabs  it does nothing else of interest  
i'm getting a much longer and weirder stack trace for now  i've switched to using google code prettify and it works fine for me  i guess you can close this issue 
ah yes  that's a lot better  i think you're telling me i don't yet have a correct compile stack    i'm also guessing the jekyll liquid     highlight c linenos     tag did auto escaping and i just need to update my nanoc compile rule to escape before using  colorizesyntax   what's the cleanest way to do this  thanks 
oh  no  i do get that only the last extension gets stripped  this bug is about none of the extensions getting stripped 
bobthecow  should be more readable now  thanks for the nudge 
apologies for not updating the post  we have an older site that uses config yaml  but it does have an entry for text_extensions  the extensions listed are your typical text file extensions  jpg is not listed there  so the issues is not resolved 
i agree    once i figured it out  no big deal     pito p s  sent from my iphone  so excuse brevity  typos  etc 
in previous nanoc 3 7 5 version when doing  item children i was getting below list when printing  item children  here  item identifier   " aihe ring "     lt nanoc  item identifier " aihe ring 1 " binary  false gt    lt nanoc  item identifier " aihe ring 2 " binary  false gt    lt nanoc  item identifier " aihe ring 3 " binary  false gt   whereas in new nanoc version 4 2 1 i tried to get the children using below pattern but when i print the list matching the pattern i am getting error already mentioned above       items find_all pattern     gives error where pattern is below here pattern   aihe ring   index html and  item identifier   ' aihe ring index html' aihe1 erb    i want to get all the child items and do sort them and add them to the parent item 
is nanoc compiling all files irrespective of changes and if yes then is there any way to stop it and compile only those file have changed or is there any way to reduce the compilation time in upgraded nanoc version  and using command nanoc compile   verbose not getting the full description where time taken  is there anyway to check detail compilation time taken by each file    nanoc_compile  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4602600 16446130 c57561cc 3dee 11e6 813b 3e7762c7da33 png 
only really done for bin flapjack  though  i think this is more about making the other scripts proper source code citizens and splitting the logic into more testable parts 
yeah i've started working towards using the neb module  for my particular situation i'll need to look into some sort of store and forward due to the nature of the links to our sites but for the generic user it should be good 
looks like it's working now  thanks

i hardly expected this level of support     affirmative to your questions  and  now  when i tried running the rewrite query in lnav   directly  i first swap out the  sc_status for just sc_status  no colons  and the command works  like    select sc_status    '  '     select message from http_status_codes where status   sc_status     '  ' from iht_apache  notice i've had to include my format as a table name  " from iht_apache"  all my queries require it   why is this  but this  with or without colons  is still not working in the rewrite  i only get http status integers for sc_status 
there it is   i can change the format if needed  what format does it expect  i think there should be some notification in lnav that separates these 2 opening modes  e g  "unrecognized log format   opening multiple files separately"
speaking for myself  it depends  i would say that most often  something in the current view will prompt me to filter out the noise  when this happens  frequently i'll already be eyeballing at least one other target for elimination  this can lead to a modest chaining of   filter out  commands  eg  4 to 7 in rapid sequence  a small percentage of the time  i'll already have something in my paste buffer  this is when i would most likely do   filter in   curious  though  are you considering an option for saving   managing  a set of filters   or maybe that's already a feature  and i need to go back to the docs     
sorry  it's 0 8 4 
the latest version compiled from git master  there's nothing much interesting there  and nothing being logged when it gets stuck     would you still need the full log   few errors like

ah  i didn't even notice the fact that there was a stub  method    false  in a before call  i guess that explains that  however  what should happen when you have a stub  method    false  should_receive  method  at_least 1  times and_return true 
i'm on rspec 2 12 as well  but rails 3 2 9  added the and_return but no luck  what error did you get without it 
hit enter on accident before i was able to type details  gathering them now  i don't see how to delete this issue
 myronmarston both these examples pass on 2 13 and fail on 2 14  i'd expect that the first one raises  mockexpectationerror  double received unexpected message  to_a with  no args    and that the second one doesn't raise anything  just returns  self  or  nil  
oh  yeah  tricky  i can't think of a way that wouldn't pollute in a monkey patchey way  sadly can't use refinements on  kernel#raise  since  kernel  a module  feels like you could have a monkey patch check on  kernel#raise  but even then it would happen before the  raise_error  expectation is registered  i guess there's no solution  😢
right before the backtrace 
ahhhhh  that must be it  thanks so much 
yes  that's more clear  thanks 
oops   using rspec mocks doubles or partial doubles outside the per test lifecycle  such as in a before  all  hook  is deprecated   2 99 0  is the rspec mocks version
sounds fair  i'll give it a try  by sending a pr   thanks 
labelsutc  false  working
thanks for your attention  sorry  i'm not familiar with jsfiddle   but you can look on my test pages    first without synchro   http   www egloff eu apaguard test1 php with  http   www egloff eu apaguard test2 php
there is a file under scripts folder push to web sh which has reference to generate combined sh  i guess we moved away from these  but they still exist in the codebase
for the ui reason  there is another use case where the stack charts will have there own date axis and at the bottom we will have just the dygraphs range selector  but the problem is dygraphs range selector dont draw axis so we have gone with our own implementation of range slider  one way would be to provide options that will allow user to specify not to draw the chart just the axis
i will  however i have never used it  i will come up to speed on jsfiddle over the weekend  thanks
yes  but this shows exactly the problem  they are not really independet series  instead there's always a null nan inserted  if one has a "clean" x axis  with fixed measurement points this might be fine  but i use it for measurements in physics where no point has exactly the same time  x axis  as another  each added measurement easely doubles the size of the dygraphs data then  since i always have to add null nan     plus i have to take care of the questions mentioned above      just found out as written on your link that null and nan behave differently  is this a wanted behaviour  it appears a bit confusing to me 
sorry if my tone was too negative  here's a version of noisydata   with 5k points  http   pastebin com rkntkv3q loading dygraphs master tests synchronize html in chrome will then take about 30 seconds  note that with only 2k points  it takes about 6 seconds  so the synchronization is not scaling well   without sync on  it takes about 4 seconds   given the importance  for my project  i'd happily help fix the issue  should i begin in synchronizer js 
shit man  can't believe i was just faq'd     you're probably right  will try again  sorry for the dumb issue    
oh that's quite nice actually  i was looking for documentation on github     thanks 
 derks actually  my application is facing encoding problems  it supports utf 8 format  but anybody runs application on system having ascii encoding set as default it throws errors with encoding  so my question is  how should i set default encoding for my application so that it is independent of system default encoding format  thank you very much for your help 
a few possibilities i can think of  1  refactor to present that same too few arguments error as in python   3 4  this might involve a lot of changes  it may not make a lot of sense if  argparse  in python    3 4 doesn't support raising an error in this condition  2  implement default function to print help by default unless overridden by an implementation  this is in line with common behavior  e g  running  git  with no arguments  3  use  abc  to make an abstract function named  default  that must be overridden  this adds complexity  but at least the interface makes the requirement explicit  if not obvious   i like 2 for being easy to implement  user friendly  and a relatively safe default  i'm not sure if all developers would want this  but it is better than raising an exception  i think  the docs could be updated to note that there is now a default default 
er  when a forum user read a thread   his broswer join the thread channel   if this thread have new reply   server push the new reply infomation to broswer so when user first time join a channel he know all the old massage   and not know the last modify time  because forum server time may not equal to push server time 
nuts  i didn't save the log and this is the only core that was dumped  maybe others were   my  worker_rlimit_core 500m   dmesg does show that i had a ton of segfaults in different nginx processes 
hi slact  thank for your time  the machine is deployed to aws ec2  those connections are directly connected to the machine  what kind of information you need to do further investigation  how do i know if this is caused by an angry router  i really don't know how to debug this issue  could you show me what i can do to trace solve this problem  thanks 
config looks like this  a bit simplified from the real one    i had one bash script doing a post to the  pub test endpoint every 3 seconds  and i was doing a no extra headers curl call to hit the  sub test every 10 20 seconds  single subscriber  although the stats coming out of  pub  had a higher subscriber count  because it probably thought my individual curl calls were different clients  
it's also possible that i'm doing something wrong  someone else's dockerfile builds fine 
i've put 3d for  nchan_message_timeout   the messages are less than 3200 bytes  the os is ubuntu 14 04 3 lts x64  the cpu is quad core amd opteron processor 1385  the nginx config for the publishers is    i have removed any configuration related to ssl or http basic auth  and also public server names 
there is no traffic     it is a test page   script
yes the same message to 2 channels but  channel 2 must be provided in the message content 
i just downloaded nchan and nginx from the download page installed them as per the doc instructions and did same as described in the conceptual overview nginx version    nginx 1 9 14    curl   request post   data "test message"  h "accept  text json" http   myip 8080 pub   curl  v   request get  h "accept  text json" http   myip 8080 pub  config
yes i know that i can define different locations  i'm talking about case when on one channel there is need to publish messages with different lifetime each  second issue is that i don't wanna define for example 100+ locations and need to reconfigure nginx each time when developers make new channel for subscribers     so there is   w+  in nginx conf and it would be nice to give an option for app developers to define dynamicly buffer length and timeout for whole channel  or even better for any single message   when it is published   this would be very powerful 
my nginx conf as below 
setting nchan_subscriber_first_message to some higher value can help in having functionality similar to head and tail  i have batch tasks while those are running i want to show last few minutes logs live on the ui to give more context on how that batch is performing  consumer can connect anytime during run and they should be able to see last lets say 100 logs but not all previous logs as there could be more than 5000 logs depending upon when they are checking  by setting nchan_subscriber_first_message to  100 i can be sure consumers will get on 100 messages from latest which works more like a tail  100  filename  
hi here is the config  just to say nchan example com is pointing to localhost
it's not a huge deal right now as this is for a longer term project and isn't planned for deployment anytime soon  i'm interested in taking a crack at it myself  but it won't be for at least another couple of months as my schedule is busy  what does sponsoring entail  if it's something i can manage then i can put it on my agenda for q1 of next year 
sorry  here is a code example  i hope it is clear 
i use faraday 0 8 4  and run proxy at my localhost  firefox works ok through this proxy  but faraday ignore my proxy settings    i run cucumber test  and check it result  faraday go to origin url always 
it sure does  i do a simple console test with the block version as well as non block  here are the result  you can try it on the console also   am i using the api the wrong way haha 
hi  imactia   actually the issue is with faraday but not with koala or other gem  i did a monkey patch for it and its working now 
ok  will look into it 
i understand that time is always a problem  just hoped my feedback could help spending time on the right direction  linking to rubydocs seems like a great start  it could help move the details to in code documentation that is easier to maintain        the cheatsheet   full example sounds great  my recommendation in that point is showing of the ideal use case and implementation  not just a reference on what options are available  but also how it is expected you use it  for example  given someone builds an adapter for twitter api using the following code  what changes would you recommend  does using faraday like this makes any sense         regarding the site navigation i think that whenever possible i would make it a single page with sections instead of multiple pages  but that is just a personal preference  thanks 
here you go  might need to run more than one time for segfault to happen

the instantiation returned does not work because notionally it is a type instantiation followed by a term instantiation  the type instantiation makes both occurrences of «a» in «g a a» equal  the subsequent term instantiation would require different instances of the same variables to be substituted by different terms and therefore is inconsistent  the terms in this example  and similar examples  that intuitively match could be made to actually match if “match_term” was allowed to return a term instantiation followed by a type instantiation followed by another term instantiation  that would allow the first term instantiation to be used to rename variables that would otherwise become the same after type instantiation  however  the current documented interface does not allow that  with the idea of “instantiation” in the documented behavior  these terms can not be matched

ok  i discovered what's happening  it totally depends on what part of the line the cursor is on  i thought that if the cursor what anywhere in the line  it'd work no matter what  i just discovered that i have to move the cursor to a specific part of a line to make it work  it seems that sometimes the suggestions work no matter which part of the line the cursor is on  and sometimes it only works when the cursor is on a specific part  e g  an un imported class name   is that how it's supposed to be  or should the suggestions always show up no matter what part of the line the cursor is on  my code is kind of big  so i can let you clone my repo if you like  if you confirm that cursor position matters  then you probably don't need to and i'll just make sure i position my cursor in the proper spot  on another related note  i've discovered that if a class is not public and i try to use it in some other package  the list of suggestions won't suggest to make the class public and import it like the eclipse text editor does  instead  it suggests adding the unknown identifier as a type parameter to the current class  are you aware of this difference in suggestion functionality

hi  kumilingus   thank you for the quick response    my goal   is to make the interaction with an parent element with some children  i e  embedded elements  to be similar to the interaction used in   powerpoint    referring to this jsfiddle  https   jsfiddle net 2zrtuqbm 61   please notice that a click move on child will actually move the whole group  this is because the parent element has higher 'z' value than the child  this is an expected behavior  as i want a regular click on any child to be delegated to the parent    however    if user instead perform double click  i hope that the action will now be on the child  currently   this can be done via 1  adjusting 'z' value  as described in the first post  2  apply 'pointer events "none"' on the parent    i believe i need to add field 'isclicked' to my custom parent element    the action double click   first pointerdown will toggle this 'isclicked' and apply 'pointer events "none"'  this would allow later clicks on this groups to be on the children    if a user click on other elements blank outside of this group  i just have to toggle the 'isclicked' status of the parent to make parent be interactive again   'pointer events "auto"'    the 'z' values of all elements in the group would remain the same    thought   the 2nd way seems simple and makes more sense to me

thanks   davedevelopment and  robertbasic 
hmmm    well  on one hand  i would like the issue resolved  but wouldn't like for you mates to "destroy" features  because of it  what about new names  such as  mockallows  and  mockexpects   _i know  it's very corny_   anyone that then still falls into this issue would be much more limited  rather than "allows" and "expects"  which i could imagine is far more used than either of us know about  alternatively  each mock could be added a single gateway or proxy method  which then could expose all mockery's api  that should prevent 99 9  of all naming collisions  yet that too would require major refactoring    honestly  i'm not the most qualified to answer this  perhaps you   we should involve a few other opinions 
 davedevelopment i am relying on the constructor arguments i pass in as i end up passing those into the calls my method will make under the hood  a lot of my expectations are argument based  which might be breaking the principle of black boxed tests a bit    i run the code and ensure child calls are made correctly w  correctly formatted data  or that we short circuit when needed  i ended up just mocking out the other method calls made inside of my class  which is just verbose but gets the job done  i was just hoping that i could do something to what is possible with java's mockito  where you can set up a  spy  and then mock entire method calls on it  they have a separate api for method assertions vs  setting up stubs  however   mockito when  vs  mockito verify  
yep  that's definitely what's happening  i have "common" files that are included reused all over  so it would be hard to make assumptions as to if it's already been included or not  i could add all of the imports to original parent file  but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to split up stylesheets in the first place  now that i know whats happening  if this is by design and you'd like it to keep it that way  i should be able to easily patch this on my end  i've already kind of hacked together a macro for  import called " absroot " to resolve issue #66 that i opened a few weeks ago  so checking to see if a file's already been imported wouldn't be too hard

hey  gjtorikian  sure thing  the repo is  shopify shopify  and options are   "since"  "2014 01 01t05 00 00z"  "sort"  "updated"  "direction"  "asc"  "page"  5    i've noticed that the more long ago the  since  parameter is  the more server errors i receive  that's why assumed the servers might be overloading with the sheer number of comments   as well  the error is not dependent on a specific page 
 pengwynn thanks  though #722 handles source import  not lock_issue  pr will follow
ah  yes that would be the issue  i had not add those as i was only trying to pass the zip file to the user rather than actually create a zip file  anyway  i've added all four of the main js files now and it seems to be have worked  many thanks 
 dduponchel while you are at it  can you rework the crc32 table so that the values are 32 bit integers  https   github com dduponchel jszip blob async_methods_generated_files dist jszip js#l226 l291 for example  the third element of the table is  0xee0e612c   which is interpreted as  3993919788   outside the set of values that can be stored in a stdint int32_t    pako explicitly computes the table  https   github com nodeca pako blob master lib zlib crc32 js  in a way that ensures the results are 32 bit integers  if you don't want to compute the table  the simplest solution may be to append   0  to all of the values in the source
after your assigning  and also change type to "blob"  it work as expected  thanks 
hmm it seems you're right  i ran a few more tests with dummy files  just created dummy files in ubuntu and compressed them with 0 compression  a 1gb file crashes chrome  works in ff  a 2gb file fails in ff but doesn't crash it  i would swear i had a  4gb file working at some point   i don't have that specific file anymore though 
i have not tried it yet  but i'd bet i t does  thanks  i found another fix but i like your  all better  my fix was to use promise reduce   to go over them in sequence  but i'd rather it with  all and all at once    
i loaded it through webpack config js  using alias
from bower json  "name"  "jszip"  "version"  "2 5 0"   filename   _jszip js_
careful though  zone does a lot of crazy stuff  so it's certainly possible that the issue is with zone and not jszip  however  zone is being used beaten on tested by a lot of people  so one would   hope   that a problem like this would be noticed if it were indeed with zone 
yes this is an issue with a chrome app  not chrome extension  i'll try in the next days to create an example app     though the news just recently came out that chrome is going to phase out apps   
thanks for the answer  however  my problem is still there  with the method i tried  i could see the progress in the console  i added the  console log metadata percent   inside the  updatecallback  now i see nothing in the console when i hit the save button  after a while before the save prompt window appearing i see the progress in the console quickly also the change of the div's width  that's probably because the for loops takes a long time to be finished rather than the time spent on  zip generateasync  either i need web worker or divide the for loop into chunks with settimeout
alright    yeah  might want to work on that i only need jszip and jszip utils to read a file  right  i can't confirm deny the xhr even is loading the file       and since the only server i have access to is public  and i'm not ready to release the tool lib i'm making  i can't do online testing   but some idiot thought it was ok to make this mandatory and sabotage local web pages apps and their creators as much as humanly possible         i'll check this out later  have some chores to deal with thanks for not just simply closing my issue    
steps to reproduce  1  unzip example zip  2  open test html 3  ctrl +shift + j to open console 4  select text zip or binary zip via the file selector in test html expected behavior  log should appear one by one in a 5 second interval  such as  start processing chunk  hello txt 1 hello world       wait 5 seconds  end processing chunk  hello txt 1 start processing chunk  hello txt 2 hello world       wait 5 seconds  end processing chunk  hello txt 2 start processing chunk  hello txt 3 hello world      actual behavior  multiple logs appears at the same time frequently  start processing chunk  hello txt 1 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 2 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 3 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 4 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 5 hello world       wait 5 seconds  end processing chunk  hello txt 1 end processing chunk  hello txt 2 end processing chunk  hello txt 3 end processing chunk  hello txt 4 end processing chunk  hello txt 5 start processing chunk  hello txt 6 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 7 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 8 hello world      start processing chunk  hello txt 9 hello world          tested on firefox 54    chrome 60   example zip  https   github com stuk jszip files 1237064 example zip 
 54mu3l it works fine in ie  thanks for your help 
sorry for my english  the animation between 2 or more backgrounds
in the public methods sections  just underneath the next function 
ohh i see  here's the page http   cargocollective com maytruong thanks for your help 
what does work on ie in general   p but that still doesn't explain why this does not work in only ie9   
hello    i was trying with the 1 2 1 dev  works fine with the 1 1 3 thanks
like i pointed out on twitter  i haven't got the exact clue where the problem resides  haven't got the time to point it out   
double checked  http   github com rmccue simplepie commit b47a83f3a186d6d6242d5f50db7d39439a2bab9e does not fix the issue i described  i am not using simplepie's download but pass in the document string directly  php version 5 2 6 of course  my issue description should say 'html entity encoded' instead of 'url encoded'   i fixed that 
i don't see how that could be done since the second level array access will always be null without another level of xml  i also looked for an method other than get_item_tags   but none of them appeaded to be able to access what i needed  you can see the output of the "release" plugin at work via this url  http   blog rogersoles com wp content plugins nextgen gallery xml media rss php and my changes  which complies with what google does  at  http   blog rogersoles com wp content plugins nextgen gallery xml media rss2 php and thank you very much for your input on this    i greatly appreciate it  and defintely prefer not to have to make patches to code that's not mine  
ooooops    yes  indeed  one should always use git clone to get the latest instead of picking some 1 2 1 version via this web interface    sorry  and thanx a billion for this wonderful piece of software 
i'm using what i thought was 1 2  version string is 'pecan'  so i'm not absolutely sure on that   i just downloaded the latest release again  and i see that it's up to 1 2 1 dev  the issue is still present in that version  but my fix for pecan doesn't work in 1 2 1 dev  so it looks like there have indeed been some changes in that area   
actually  i use version 1 2 from https   github com rmccue simplepie downloads  but in source inc it has define 'simplepie_version'  '1 2 1 dev'   perhaps current version from trunk has this bug fixed  but we don't use simplepie anymore because our rss loader migrated to java  thank you 
i just installed xampp and just got simplepie from your site  i will try again and see what happens
https   github com pussbb atom https   www googleapis com buzz v1 activities pussbb  public i think maybe it's just error with ssl lib 
the newest  version 1 2
double encode do useless encode of already encoded items and break them
hello  it sounds that the issue might be resolved as i tried to reproduce it now and no problem     strange the ' and 2 were replace by something like  123     i was having this issue with the published feed in tiny tiny rss  the developper gave me a code to add to one of the file but it didn't fix the issue at the time  maybe it tool longer to accept the change in my config
apologies if i'm doing it wrong  but shouldn't there be a demo folder when downloading the master at  https   github com simplepie simplepie archive master zip and likewise when downloading 1 5 at  http   simplepie org downloads

oh  i'm pretty new to scala and didn't know of the unpacking  list "a"  "b"  "c"  _   syntax  which i'm guessing is just like python's   list   cool  thanks 
the examples look good  i'll move this request there  will open one asking for and explanation of the divide between breeze and nak then   
ahh  yep _ lt guilty  gt _ using latest betas of xcode 7    
the following snippet will give an crash   pre      use  c loadnextrange and  c loadpreviousrange to page     the slcscorescontroller object may be re set at any time to perform a completely different search  if required      the score sort order is defined by the developer and stored on the scoreloop server    pre  parsed as  gbparagraphdecoratoritem 'the slcscorescontroller…search  if required   text 'the'  link 'slcscorescontroller'  text 'object may be re set…search  if required '  '  gbparagraphtextitem ' null '  gbparagraphdecoratoritem 'the score sort order…scoreloop server  text 'the score sort order…scoreloop server '  ' 
thanks  can't believe i missed that 
you are right  thank you  didn't see that one before 
ok  it works without star prefix  thanks for your reply  closing 
redis 1 0 2 gem still has this issue
  redis server  v redis server version 1 3 8
we upgraded to 2 0 2  we still got the error  although this time it just occurred a single time instead of getting stuck in the bad state so its much less of an issue 
 pietern hmm i think this is happening during  while job    resque_worker reserve      resque queues      redis smembers  queues      but i'll try putting in a few more debugger statements to make sure   soveran    that's what i was thinking    i'll give that a shot  but in either case  how is the ioerror bubbling past  redis  connection#disconnect   it is possible the stack trace is not accurate  it's kind of weird that the stack trace is showing  " users bob  rvm gems ree 1 8 7 2010 02 gems redis 2 1 1 lib redis connection rb 23 in  read'" when connection rb 23 is actually the  disconnect  method   
_facepalm_
 pietern any idea how i could continue debugging here 
yes  i have running sentinels  here is my sentinels conf file
it is a hacky workaround  certainly  given the code i posted above  i am running a redis thread within a websocket event driven process  within the ws open  i listen for a redis response  originally using subscribe but now using brpop  without prior notice to me  eventually ws close occurs  at that point  the ws open process has already deleted my redis thread  so  i don't have a choice but to clean up the remnants  and  because any further redis command on that connection immediately hangs on synchronize  since the issuing thread is gone  my last resort is a kill i have posted the same  issue on faye websocket ruby  https   github com faye faye websocket ruby issues 104  and requested the opportunity to clean things up before the open deletes them  that would be the preferred solution  of course  seems like a yield at that point would be prudent  yet  in any case  if the only options for kill is id or address port  i should be able to obtain either one of those values using a real method instead of a hack against a string  is that doable 
will do 
you're right  i was using an older version of batteries  1 5 0  that did have this problem  but thought i was using 2 0  then when i looked at the master branch  i somehow incorrectly convinced myself it was still broken  and thus was a regression  sorry for the mistake 
i've tried with both 2 0   2 0 1  with both webmock 1 4   1 5  while the error between 1 4   1 5 is slightly different  it is conceptually similar with an error on configure 
the stacktrace shows no lines at all besides those of my own code  there are nothing related to webmock or vcr on the stack  just the error message itself about the missing constant  i'll try to re run it using the previous vcr version  do you think it can work or isn't it supposed to work with vcr at all at this point  thanks 
i recall i already did  the gem version listed in the stacktrace was one of the downgrades i did in order to check this error  the latest excon clashes badly also with the vcr webmock combo  i'll try again when i have few minutes

yeah i know  sorry to report it  sob  but i really like the feature and use it all the time  maybe it is possible to modify the webmock matcher to work in conjunction with the one from rspec  you can have a look at  https   www relishapp com rspec rspec mocks v 2 14 docs spies and maybe some info in this article  http   myronmars to n dev blog 2013 07 rspec 2 14 is released
ah  i found the reason  specifying a query param value with boolean  true  instead of the string  'true'  causes it to break  this won't work    with query  hash_including  something  true    but this will    with query  hash_including  something  'true'    something interesting about this is that specifying  fixnum s instead of strings works fine  this works    with query  hash_including  something  100    do booleans have a special interpretation  or would this be considered a bug  i can submit a pull request if this is unexpected behavior  which  to be honest  was unexpected for me   thanks for your time 
 bblimke sure  here you go  my api wrapper    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2733755 37384229 e1c9fb9a 274d 11e8 8f31 ab411d96048f png  and its tests    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2733755 37384216 d3548378 274d 11e8 9b13 467b95183fa2 png 
 bblimke turns out webmock did not see my stubbed request because i added  stub_request  to spec_helper rb  the test that failed was  test controllers posts_controller_test rb  which isn't an rspec test  my bad    
the culprit seems to be the addition of  schema to the variations  so the match is not made  so either we add the plain string without the schema to the matches_with_variations method or change the heuristic_parse method in the addressable gem to add the http schema even for hosts without a period in the name
stub_request  post  "url"   with   request  request body     "name"    "john doe" "email"             "phone_number"       0 9      "linkedin_profile"    ""     to_return status  200  body  ""  headers

good morning  i don’t think so  i just wanted to arrive at the same value that excel percentrank inc give me  quantilerank min give me the same result  i was testing the other rankdefinition to understand the difference and when i could use them in the future  thanks for asking

actually in excel i was talking about  loi student inverse      yep a french version of excel give french method name  it appears that  loi student inverse  is deprecated  you may use  loi student inverse bilaterale  instead and of course the unilateral is named  loi student inverse n   i now see that the issue come from excel method french names  thanks for your time and explanations  they make it crystal clear  
sounds reasonable to me  i like the idea of configurable nfs shares  would also need to tie that into the ebs volume definitions to make sure that nfs mount directives don't clash with ebs volume directives   
ok  i think i found the problem  i installed the pycrypto with yum first  then i realized that yum  at least in centos  installs the version 2 0 1 22 which is not enough for starcluster  then i downloaded and installed pycrypto 2 6 with python setup py  so at that point they were both installed      anyway  i uninstalled with yum the 2 0 1 and resintalled 2 6 and now i dont see that error anymore       but  i am seeing this other one  usr lib64 python2 6 site packages crypto util number py 57  powminsecurewarning  not using mpz_powm_sec  you should rebuild using libgmp    5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability  _warn "not using mpz_powm_sec  you should rebuild using libgmp    5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability "  powminsecurewarning  thanks a lot    rezuma

the instance type is the same  it's possible that in my tinkering with  qconf  i did something silly 
it's  support of extended keys is on   i've installed it via homebrew 
i know how to get on my config   its just that because i use terminal apps too much i get confused when switching between them  the nmap feature is useful but i don't think thats a good way to use that everytime i forget a key  is there any way to make the suggestion list smaller like only show the 2 first keys character then show the third if i use that shortcut for example  map  md move to download map  md move to documents map  mh move to home map  mm move to music what i would like to try is having pressing a shortcut and only show  m key first and if i press that the d d h m keys suggestion shows up  this is how it works now but only the second part   this way i could map a few keys to a shortcut and not be worried about the suggestion list 
with this  and by changing the call string in the vifmrc  so  no arguments are printed by echo
we are using ruby 2 0 0 p247  and rspec  2 14 1

 grosser thanks for your reply  i has redis service per processing running  and i try to use 'fakeredis' gem for testing  it's working good now  thanks a lots 
no  i’m just running parallel spec as a dependency of a multitask  i also have one custom parallel task 
will try with the same     
 rosskevin  pull request https   github com grosser parallel_tests pull 446 was already created and merged  should work in v1 7 1 
 grosser pr submitted  i took a look into why this was happening since i hadn't noticed it with other gems  after digging a bunch i found that there isn't a problem with the code  the reason the tasks do not show up is because the gem is only in the   development  group in the gemfile  in order for the tasks to appear it has to be outside of groups or in the   test  group in addition to   development   the reason why is something i don't yet understand but have compiled into a  stackoverflow question  http   stackoverflow com questions 37013545 why is rake t run with rails env test   hopefully someone more familiar with rake and rails will answer it 
yep  the same  mvn compile does compile the project but tests appears to fail  daniele

sorry  i have no way to provide this sample  it cannot be transmitted from the intranet segment to the extranet segment on the intranet segment of the company  it is provided by the art department to detect whether it contains hidden content  i wrote a decoder to read the original information of each block from binary  thank you very much for your reply  if i get this sample on the extranet segment  i will send it to you in time  zzl 抱歉，我没有办法提供这个样本。它在公司的内网网段，无法从内网网段传送到外网网段。它是美术部门提供的用于检测是否含有隐藏内容。我写了一个解码器用于从二进制读取各个数据块的原始信息。 非常感谢你的回复，如果我在外网网段获得了这个样本，我会及时将它发送给你。 zzl
the issue occurs while we try to update the user that is currently logged in  here is my full stacktrace 
yeah i wasn't sure and still haven't figured out where the malforming occurs  i can't find where  paramters are set yet  expected is just as the code performs concatenating  tcp   172 17 0 2 6379  which works great when the name is changed 
this is mine  2 database used for 2 different applications  in both cases favoring the first server  server 1  db0 keys 2914 expires 0 db2 keys 38495 expires 0 server 2  db0 keys 1735 expires 0 db2 keys 21803 expires 0 i'm using the php 5 2 tag 
this is my controller  route  get ' test'  function    cache  put 'name'  'taylor'  60     error！  name   cache  get 'name'   echo  name      when i was used redis cli call my redis server  everything is ok  i used the phpunit test the redis server  all is right  but while i was make refresh the api many times  sometimes ok  another time failed     
 romilgoel i'm not the best person to ask but based on findings over the last few days check that your redis server has enough space  i'm using heroku redis and finding that the hard limits  for redis client connections and memory  can cause things to not work when deployed as they do locally  try using redis cli and running the various commands to understand what your server's state is
yes  it works with ruby 1 8 7  i am using rvm   and i have try this from two different machines and we have got the same error 
c  irb dl is deprecated  please use fiddle irb main  001 0  require 'netrc' loaderror  cannot load such file    netrc from c  ruby200 x64 lib ruby 2 0 0 rubygems core_ext kernel_require rb 5 5 in  require' from c  ruby200 x64 lib ruby 2 0 0 rubygems core_ext kernel_require rb 5 5 in require' from  irb  1 from c  ruby200 x64 bin irb 12 in   main ' irb main  002 0  require 'net netrc'    true irb main  003 0     so loading netrc alone doesn't seem to work  but loading net netrc does  load_path isn't defined  maybe that's why 
i actually ended up removing the code  but the pretty vanilla api that i could see the user param from is here  https   github com tomprats personify  i tried a lot of different config options and still got the param
i see  thanks 
this occurs with 1 8 0 
sorry for the typo  sob  and i am using  'rest client'  '   2 0'   i believe this is the latest version 
hallo  thank you
i guess you should probably not do this   p
yeah  it seems so  so the bug report for rails is here  https   github com rails rails issues 1858
 jonrowe sounds good to me  i will make a pr 
looks like it was installed in mid july from svn  revision 3323 
here's my settings 
the 2 x release didn't work for me   test coverage was being incorrectly calculated  so it was either that or accept the fact that i couldn't demonstrate 100  code coverage 
are you able to see this one    screen  http   i imgur com wkcblaf png  the otherone was png also  not sure why it didn't display  they all display properly on my chrome brower under linux and osx 
yep  will do 
oh  sorry  i just realized that this was the wrong forum  i thot this covered xdebug because i found a really similar bug here 
in the root folder  i use  vendor bin phpunit  to execute the tests    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 686067 62472150 7e072e80 b774 11e9 94b6 626b293a0a76 png  it is a large project  last week this started to happen after installing pcov and  pcov clobber  to run faster coverage 
i don't have that i'm afraid  happened a month ago  there is an example at the top of the linked page  it may help reproduce the bug  anyway  as a developer  this kind of existence check makes sense to me  
so how to do it    like this  seems it doesn't work   
i think you need to add a semicolon at the first line   just like the code blow 
i don't know what happened  now it is working  i deleted the text and re added it to the database  i am assuming someone pasted from word  which we all know is bad    thanks romanx for the reply 
yes  thank you 
hi   thanks for the answer   alas  i just have access to the mustache templates  the rest is part of an app  mviewer   i'd rather not mess in their core code  would there be  by chance  a special tag that would allow to retrieve an entire object  serialized   that might be quite handy and would solve my pb too
i did not explain myself properly and perhaps my use is a bit strange  my form comes from the server with all elements defined  i call  uniform when the document loads and then remove elements which are to be shown only if certain radio boxes are selected  when these radio boxes trigger the elements removed are added back  calling  uniform in this case didn't work  nor make sense  at least not based on my reading of the code  nice work by the way 
basically i dynamically switch some hidden inputs  and the main issue here is that after using uniform it makes all inputs visible  even hidden ones  because it adds allways visible parent div no matter what 
hmm tough call there  i would imagine that would be fine  i also noticed that if i replace a button i cant tab to it from a form  but that is probably for another issue
hmm  i'll take a closer look on my site  i assumed it was uniform  but perhaps something else is resorting them  for example  it's happening on this page  http   www madecollection com product made in usa playfield cotton lace babydoll  apologies  you'll need to register  feel free to put in a dummy name email address  in the size select markup  and in the flash of unstyled content  you can see the select in the correct order  but then it gets styled and is out of order  sorted by the value attribute  which my ecomm platform sets  thanks 
yes  and it still put some width on the element 
sure  i'll test it 
i solved it  it was a problem related to an error in another plugin
i'll make a try and let you know if it works  thank you so much 
it's tested on winodws 7 and appearing on firefox  chrome and ie10 and ie10 in "ie9 mode"  unfortunately the jsfiddle page does not work well in ie10 in "ie 8 mode" so i could not verify anything below version 9 
from the uniformjs com home page  extra parameters you can pass in extra parameters to control certain aspects of uniform  to pass in parameters  use syntax like this    "select"  uniform   param1  value  param2  value  param3  value     alternately  you can specify global defaults by using the defaults property  note  the property name changed in v2 0    uniform defaults checkedclass   "uniformcheckedclass"    uniform defaults filebtntext   "pick a file"  with uniform 1  the first method to update defaults  then options  updated the global options object  maybe i'm reading this wrong  but "alternately" comes across as "either" to me 
i can indeed get the "submit" button focused via tab when using the develop brach demo  not the "reset" button though    this was tested with opera and chrome 
i did  with no luck i'm afraid   
salut joel  everything look’s fine  thank’s again  i keep making autojump huge publicity  bépo  zeitgeist…   thank’s a lot 
hmm   i'm on mac os x 10 5 8  can't upgrade to 10 6 yet   with zsh 4 3 10 from macports  i tried using the built in 4 3 4  got the same results  even after deleting all my customizations and blowing away the autojump directory  i just tried creating a new account that uses  bin bash  3 2 17 1  release  i386 apple darwin9 0    but install sh says  grep   users jaytest  bash_profile  no such file or directory   install sh  line 79     too many arguments i did  in fact  touch an empty  bash_profile but that didn't change the error message  how can i troubleshoot 
well  not if you set a custom prefix btw  it would be preferable if the default prefix was " usr local" instead of " usr"

i am very sorry  but i can't  when i saw that this thread had been moved to 'closed' without being answered i assumed it was not going to be answered  so i manually uninstalled version 18 and tried again with the fedora package  which was version 15   i had exactly the same problem with this until i switched to using bash instead of zsh and on bash it appears to work normally  what i think might have been confusing it is the fact that although i was using zsh it was not a login shell i simply launched it with the  e switch  gnome shell  e zsh  although that is purely speculation on my part  i have since uninstalled zsh as well  so basically i have worked around my own problem with this program  thank you for replying anyway 
cool  thanks  although it still seems like the exit status is the right thing to check  there shouldn't be much difference  although it could mask a failure in autojump printing dirs that no longer exist 
probably
yes  it jumps to   home cipri documents work   as it's supposed to  just the autocompletion has faults

i think it could make sense  but you could in theory also run into typical floating point conversion issues like this  http   yuiblog com blog 2009 03 10 when you cant count on your numbers    i'm not totally sure what the best tactic is  without a decimal type i don't think that there's any really great solution  the only time i can think of that i've used bigdecimal is for currencies  so it could make sense to go with a type for that that is integer based and not worry about the rest  that was the issue i ran into the other night when i put this issue in  it could make sense to just say that users should use an integer and coerce them as they need in their applications 
well  this behaviour could have the dynamic keys use case  the fact is that i didn't know about dynamic keys  which replaces this very well  so just close the issue please  my mistake  for example  one could define an empty post class that plugins would use    for example  a tags plugin    by adding keys into it  but it could be done in the launching  so that this problem does not occur 
yes  last version  0 6 10   
0 8 6  seems like it's probably been fixed on head though  as almost all of callbacks rb has been replaced with some activesupport classes

strange because i installed zinnia with   when i found the problem removed it and checked if the directory was removed from site packages  the installed it again with the same command  and every time i do that every time fails on collectstatic  when i installed it from github everything was fine  and this happens on two different machines 
hi  after some research  i've found the source of the issue  there was two versions of jquery library declared  one in the main page  and the other into a html that is rendered inside a div using the tab function  jquery ui   i've already solved this  thanks  felipe
ok well fair enough  shame though because this plugin does everything i want in a nice easy package  with the exception of the data format  the serialized string format is just yuck to work with on the back end

hi  thanks for answering  i know about the receivedcalls   and agree that it would let me implement  verifyzerointeractions    easily  the problem is with  verifynomoreinteractions     because while  receivedcalls    remembers which calls were received  it does not remember which calls were matched  i e  verified successfully    verifynomoreinteractions    says "verify there were no calls other than those already verified"  so i would need to pass those calls again to any query i make against  receivedcalls     that would seem awkward  especially in the light of the fact that simplicity of use is one of the core reasons i picked nsubstitute for my team  please let me know your thoughts

hi  it returns 0  but it should not be possible to evaluate   actual    actual isdeepequal expected  null    since  isdeepequal  come from the package deepequal and could not be loaded  since there is missing binding redirect  i am not sure where it should throw  without knowing the implementation details  i think it would make sense when i am calling the method of the mock since it has to evaluate it to determine the results somewhere  when a error occur in the expression  does it catch all exceptions   thanks
it didn't introduce a bug  however i found no way to test following wrapper 
why not use the    xxx  flag to know what to load rather than implicitly loading files from random gems  regardless of rails' behavior  say a dep of a dep has a minitest plugin that i don't really care about  how do i prevent it from running  is the onus for opting out of a plugin supposed to be put on every plugin author  why is this an opt out system and not an opt in system  in this case  i have a bad apple plugin and no escape 
oh     i see  i was in fact not running tests from rake  but rather requiring the test files from an external script  i hadn't "  test" in the loadpath  as it wasn't needed at all in the previous versions  adding "  test" to the loadpath did solve the problem  i understand thus that metametadata rb will stay where it is  thank you  and sorry for the noise 
why would i want any refute methods  if i could always negate what's passed to assert  i just though it was odd that all other  assert_  methods also had  refute_  methods except this one 
i've seen it  of course that can not be the primary source of the problem but the facts are    when i install minitest this way   gem 'minitest'  '3 2 1'  git  "git   github com seattlerb minitest git"  commit  "d0936aa04a5d22f376be7fe1741fd06c2b969808"  and i advance in the commits from the last commit of the version  3 2 0  to the last commit of the version  3 3 0   i remark that my tests fail to run since the last commit of version  3 3 0    when i install version  3 3 0  the usual way   gem 'minitest'    my tests fail to run  but when i edit the source code of the gem and revert  3 3 0  to  3 2 0  by hand  i can run my tests again  i guess it can give some clues about what happens  no  you're right  when i uninstall  minitest reporters   i can run my test again with  minitest 3 3 0   so i guess the problem is that  minitest reporters   at least version  0 8 0   is not compatible with  minitest 3 3 0   i will dig this way  however  minitest reporters  does not seem to be the only reporters with this problem   eranb uses  turn  and seems to have a similar problem  maybe it will be possible to have a common solution  we'll see  very simple  i use rubymine and i just follow this  http   www jetbrains com ruby webhelp minitest html i am not expert in any way in ruby testing frameworks 
so sorry  what a silly question  thanks very much  
 tenderlove  that works for  assert   but how about for  assert_equal   just about every other assertion  if not all  wrap that argument in the  message  method   bhenderson yes  something like that 
sorry for slow reply   i've been busy with client work  the fix you suggest won't solve my problem  because i want to use the latest minitest  it looks like i'll have to have a closer look at whether i can change the mocha tests to work a different way 
what would be nice is if  test_001_anonymous  is  must have_content 'foo'    that somehow the reporter could output  test_001_must_have_content_foo  based on #description on the matcher  if possible 
i dove back into the zeus source and got a fix merged in  thanks for the help  ryan  https   github com burke zeus pull 347
i'll check within a week
thx for ur reply  self class is what i am looking for  thx so much
 zamith  i discovered it accidentally while turning some rspec tests into minitest and trying the closest code first  which obviously doesn't work because stubs in rspec behave differently  so yeah this is a pretty unlikely case  although like you said  an error message which describes exactly what is happening would be nice  i suppose we could check if  self respond_to  new_name   
this might have been better broken up into other issues  don't really care if the name changes  changed the issue title obviously  mainly just wish we had a setup and teardown that would only run once 
copied over to #730  closing    
investigating better is the same problem as #730  but they released a fix for rails 5 1  in rails rails#31624  not 5 0  could you add a fix to it in rails 5 0  for now i locked the minitest version to 5 10 3 and it works well 
that was 1 0 99 which is available from pypi i should try trunk version 
that looks good  if i understand correctly this should lead to max 3 queries right  without the caching   and some questions about the implementation  why the quadruple lookup  exact lang_code  exact short_lang_code  startswith lang_code  startswith short_lang_code   shouldn't the two exact lookups suffice  would it make sense to define the translatedobjectmanager on the translatedobjectmixin so it is automatically in place  would it make sense to override the translatedobjectmanager all   with a method that always fetches it's translations  the way translations are set up  it's almost hard to imagine you wouldn't always want some of the properties that are language specific 
well  the idea is to substitute xawtv for some other package  the xawtv project has a last cvs snapshot dating feb 2010 and doesn't look like is under active development anymore  also  they don't have any bugtracker or similar on the webpage      
i recently upgraded to version 0 5 1 and it "restored" the cron job in the user's crontab that i had deleted from a previous version  it also seems to reappear when running   usr share prey prey sh   for instance  when i check the version or check for updates   these two are possibly related  please let me know if you need any other information

okay  i am using 10 5 so i couldn't use quicktime but i was able to find a program called screenflow  hopefully the giant watermark through the middle isn't too much of a distraction  i didn't know where to post it so i uploaded it to youtube for now  i also hope my intended purpose in the video was clear  i start by showing how searching by title works and autocompletes and then i restart notational velocity and now when i try to use the same search nothing comes up  i then try a couple other terms with no results  i then show my preferences though i am pretty sure it did the same thing with the other save settings  finally i rename the title of one of my notes to "a" and rename it back and now i can search it by title with auto complete again  hope that clears it up  http   www youtube com watch v obnhre7k8tw
in our case  we use the post body for something else  so it cannot be used for the query params  i don't want to introduce the complexity of using a multipart body  so with net http  we were using both the post body and the url query params  for now  we have switched to using put because typhoeus doesn't ignore the params in that case  but we'd prefer to switch back to using post  which is more correct for our application 
you're right  i waited a few hours  seems to be okay now 
faraday  0 8 4  typhoeus  0 5 4  libcurl 7 19 7 1ubuntu1 built with c ares support the simplest code is for the twitter example  toss this in application rb  for rails 3   i believe sferik has also replicated the issue  he might be able to give you more detailed info about the internals of his gem 
i'm not sure how low level typhoeus goes  but base64 ing is done at some point already because it works for most combinations  it seems some previous url parsing that is not working well but i am not so deep into the code in the typhoeus ethon stack

using the z component to automatically set the parallax value is one option i was thinking about for the api  but  in keeping with gosu's "hands off" approach  i might just have "window#draw_left  "   "window#draw_right  " and let the author control parallax manually  it's a good idea to scale objects as they move in out  and the latter method would make that easier to customize  there's a million and one other issues waiting to mug unsuspecting programmers  but i we can get to those once i we get the basic mechanism going

i made a second package called "nodebox" which pull from the last release 3 0 44 using commit tag 579ef04883e192f85b76b532883cb135f1fb684d this package will have to be updated manually at the next release https   aur archlinux org packages  o 0 seb nd k nodebox outdated  sb n so a pp 50 do_search go
it is win 10 and latest version of nodebox  thank you  11 oca 2019 cum 12 00 tarihinde stefan  notifications github com  şunu yazdı 
sure    
i worked around this by installing em http request 0 3 first  using gem install em http request  v 0 3   just tested it with bundler and that works as well  thank you for your responses 
some certificates are signed by certificate authorities that are not directly in the list of trusted certificate issuers  to verify these certificates an intermediate certificate  or multiple  are needed that go up the certificate chain until it reaches a known good certifcate authority root certificate  you are right  this is not mentioned in the nodejs documentation at http   nodejs org docs latest api https html#https createserver  however one sentence there  the options is similar to tls createserver       points to this documentation  http   nodejs org docs latest api tls html#tls createserver i also found this discussion  http   groups google com group nodejs browse_thread thread 2b9d788224cfbd3d which points out that the ca  property of the options to https createserver   is indeed supported  the "patch" above adds code to faye's listen method so that the ca option is supported and passed along to https createserver   
no extensions are installed  my server side code  faye related part   var express   require 'express'    faye   require 'faye'   var app   module exports   express createserver    var bayeux   new faye nodeadapter   mount  ' faye'  timeout  45     app configure function    app set 'views'  __dirname + ' views'   app set 'view engine'  'jade'   app set 'view options'   layout  __dirname + ' views layouts default'    app use express bodyparser     app use express methodoverride     app use express cookieparser     app use express session   secret  'my secret'      app use everyauth middleware     app use app router   app use express static __dirname + ' public'        bayeux attach app   app listen 3000   yes  i was using faye 0 7 1 with node 0 4 x  and everything worked pretty well  but after upgrade to my current configuration i receive these errors 
sorry i meant on the server side  i want to intercept messages from the server to the client  and add an auth token there
these are the error messages in the console  
you're close but ipv6 addresses need to be wrapped in square brackets  for example  with your change  uri stringify uri parse "http    2620 a3 e030 11a1 215 17ff fee9 3068  9292 "   results in "http   2620 a3 e030 11a1 215 17ff fee9 3068 9292 "  it needs to be "http    2620 a3 e030 11a1 215 17ff fee9 3068  9292 "  i'll let you decide if you want to do that in parse when setting uri hostname or somewhere else 
the look and animations are already there  if not fully  then at least in part  we already have an annular determinate mode   it just needs an indeterminate counterpart  the regular determinate mode look animation  mbprogresshudmodedeterminate  is fine for the pie chart part of the progress  all that remains is to layer the annular indeterminate on top of the determinate  to achieve this mixed mode

it actually happens when retrieving the three properties from  parser nameservers   the exception message is  for example  in whois nic ch rb on line 96 is written   list name  ipv4   ip if whois  server valid_ipv4  ip    but the corresponding method in server rb on line 361 is private  after it's declaration on line 329  i'm using the latest jruby version 9 1 7 0 by using the  org jruby embed scriptingcontainer   previously i used your 3 x version  now i'm upgrading to 4 x  unfortunately i'm also struggling with some weird type conversion errors and the corresponding error messages are mostly not very helpful  e g  when expecting a time type  java  rubytime  but the variable is nil  suddenly the type for jruby is of type string  rubystring   this is the price to pay when bridging a dynamically typed language with a static one  any pointer to a page with best practices about type conversion between these two languages would be very helpful 
 geemus yes this is what i am doing and it works  but i already have the binary string and dont want to create another tempfile  burns thanks  i'll give it a try i still think this is a bad workaround which could be prevented by not concatenating two strings  btw i am using it together with fog s3 
i've been reluctant to do that because there are some serious multithreading problems with timeout and http  it's an established problem when doing http calls inside sidekiq  https   github com mperham sidekiq issues 862  as timeout sometimes has no effect  so i thought maybe a lower level solution is needed  but maybe not much excon could do  i'll try timeout anyway 
i tried to debug it for a few minutes  but it was a painful experience  because the pow server crashed each time  that might be something weird that the fog   fog core gem does  in any case  with excon 0 38 0 it works ok  with 0 39 5 it crashes  unfortunately i cannot provide any other information at the moment  i'll try to add some backtraces later 
indeed  i'm attempting to upload to s3 over https  i ran the test against f86765e4e5e81493e1cd3ff6d97a8c0c882be5e3 and unfortunately i see the same error 
hi  yup that's what we need too  ideally though we would actually have a total_request_timeout which covers connecting  writing any request body  then reading response  thanks  colin
i can understand the reluctancy  it isn't necessarily your problem that the mongoid team decided to abandon the bson_ext  and mongo gems  it would have been nice if they could have made it work  even with those gems required by other ones  it seems like this move will break a lot of other gems too  from my experimentation  and research  mongoid 3 refuses to operate if those gems are used  maybe i should post the request on the mongoid issue page  or  maybe we can create a mongoid3 compatible datastore  and place the mongo related datastores in separate gems  thank you for your time  i enjoy using dragonfly so much  i would rather stick with mongoid 2 until this is all figured out

 jrief my case  i have a banners placeholder  the moderators can use to upload banner images  sometimes they use banners created by designer and they have accurate size and optimised quality  but sometimes they just want to upload any image and i have to fit it to banner container box  thats why i want to skip thumbnailer and use original image 
i guess just  extends "base"   leaving it up to erlydtl to find either  dtl or  html if they exist 
i have a problem  i can't find this file in the repository  where i should insert this method 
the latest one that is  the second example worked for me  it was taken from the twilio docs
i figured out the issue on my end     test this on your servers and see if this works  copy and paste their  twilio folder in a directory on your site  do not change "twilio" folder name   make a file and add this code with your credentials  then go to that page on a url  hopefully you should get a text within 15seconds 
ban should be in banned_ip cfg  if so  there is no ban  i have tried from different ip and it also gives me exception 'rconnoauthexception' with message 'not authenticated yet ' in sourceserver php 117 stack trace  #0 tt php 7   sourceserver  rconexec 'status'  #1  main  could you confirm that steam condeser's rcon works on current version 
wow  it's unbelievable that i did not see it  thank you 
it returned 3 for 22 of them  and 0 for 2 of them out of total 530 items in which 22+3 items are rs 
i'm using php  any way i can help  just let me know 
yea  looks like it was removed  i'll keep eyeing for changes  a side note  i think i'm going to make an automated diff agent for  isteamwebapiutil  getsupportedapilist  that will alert me when there's changes  both with and w o a key 
no error  however literally anything with rcon seems to do this  rcon exec  rcon auth  etc
 kou oh  i misunderstood the default    log path  is  stdout  or  stderr   thx 
 kou we don't know yet  this is first time  i don't know how to narrow down the cause of the crash   do you have   or anything try    so we are going to enable core dump for this server  thanks 
if it's fall concert and we have an underground show that saturday  then on saturday i won't be able to see what equipment is free without having to look in the past view  since the load in happened already  it also gets awkward for things like pre rigs where you're slowly adding stuff each day  especially for multiday pre rigs like lg 
might as well   if it's never used  there's no reason for it to be there

say there's a user which might or might not belong to a group  class user extends activerecord base   static  belongs_to   array array 'group'      class group extends activerecord base     i want to print all user names with their group names   users   user  all    foreach  users as  user    print  user  name  if  user  group_id     null  print  user  group  name    however  this will use lazy loading to get the group of each user  let's optimize it   users   user  all array 'joins'     array 'group'    but now the built join will exclude all the users with no group  replacing it with a left join will be perfect for the above code

i received a confirmation that this is currently a known issue with shopify and that the developers are looking into a fix  i can of course reproduce this at will  however i have to do that with the cooperation of a merchant  so it is a bit of a production 
i think the presence of more than one pending charge is leading to a bug i see  why else would i have a client with 16 of them  and her claim that shopify is not asking her for approval on an app  she is creating them  but the redirect to the confirmation url is not happening 
for sure  the project is on rails 5 0 and my next step is to add  shopify_api  back in 
no  its pretty much constant  for example i tried a number of times for this same variant and image combo a number of times during the last few days  regardless of how many times i tried it it fails  even my code redoes the failed requests a up to 3 times  they also all fail  but i did find a work around  and that works  which is honestly strange  the only thing i can think of is there are additional validations on update that are failing on some of the other attributes  validations which only trigger on update and not create 
yes sorry  ill open this up in core
which means it is a bug in catalysts psgi implementation  what about warnings  should plack then catch warnings and stuff tehm in psgi error stream  or are we ok with them just "vanishing"  if it is not a regression  it sure as hell was a useful accidental feature of the old implementation   
sure  making the behaviour configurable would be all right 
i was looking for some sort of install instructions for other distros  this is a python form that calls synaptic package manager  so it should be easy to install on debian  but it's not because it has some other mint packages as dependencies that apparently conflict with some other debian packages  i actually don't remember exactly which were these packages  cause i tried this installation sth like 1 month ago

hi  i just ran pip install django taggit  i assume it installed the master branch  i'm using django version 1 5 
thank you for fast reply  django  1 10 4 django taggit  0 21 3
i do not 
i made a test project and work properly with django 1 7 and 1 9  just that i need taggit in xadmin have no way to solve this  
when  tag  status   usertag objects get_or_create name "abc1"  user   user objects get id request user id   then   on pip  django taggit  0 18 3  django  1 6 11  this fails when second user wants to add the same tag  'abc1'   thanks
thanks for your reply  i upgraded to 1 9 6 but i am still seeing the issue after restarting the tomcat service  i also added maxinactiveinterval "10800" to my context xml  3 hours   was this the correct place to set it  if so  should i evict any sessions flush memcached to see a change 
very good questions   sorry for not providing details  redis  2 0 0 rc2 redis rb  2 0 2 redis namespaces  0 5 0 resque  1 9 5 resque scheduler  1 9 2

we bounced everything and flushed the master lock and restarted all the schedulers    things caught up pretty quickly    i'll keep an eye out for if this happens again

thanks for your quick reply  with net ssh 2 7 0 it works  with net ssh 2 8 0 the password from ssh agent isn't picked up anymore  at least  that's what i think is happening 
i would start from fresh  clone the repo again into your home directory then you can do  bash init sh  then  vagrant up  and now i am getting this error  an error occurred in the underlying ssh library that vagrant uses  the error message is shown below  in many cases  errors from this library are caused by ssh agent issues  try disabling your ssh agent or removing some keys and try again  if the problem persists  please report a bug to the net ssh project  timeout during server version negotiating
 mfazekas thanks for the information  i will try removing all the different ssh net gem versions installed and test it again 
hi  mfazekas  i've tried it with 3 2 0 rc2 and i get the same error 
and i can't reproduce it now  so i'm unsure how 3 2 0 got installed 
hi  may be the problem is in the following  1  i'm connecting from workstation to node1 with the password 2  node 1 is connecting to node to with public key with the same user may be problem in this 
using  knife solo 0 7 0 pre   net ssh  goes to  2 4 1  and now works with  ruby 2 4 1      thank you  mfazekas and  perlun for the solution   3

apologies  i don't keep a close eye on github notifications  this is where i am  when i used  require  as in the example above i got errors so i did this  define functions that i want to use in another file  grammar includes js    that worked  thank you for saving me a lot of effort 
so inline directive might form a problem  but full blown table not  i would be doing below rst tables instead of normal presentations without size types sizes  etc  before or after the variable  or struct member in this case  name i would append my own columns if when needed to provide additional information  that is why i thought inlining would be useful   as with that we can form whatever we wish from doxygen in whatever design we fit  i have a script to implement a table in rst i would contribute  but i would then just need some advice how to get variable names and descriptions from breathe in rst

i'm using 0 13 7 201111141412  i guess it is the latest daily build version  i've set my workspace eiditor encoding as utf 8  preference    general    content type  text    erlang source file i changed to default encoding form iso 8859 1 to utf 8  but it still doesn't work 
adding  usr lib erlang to runtimes solves this  sorry  that was a bit obvious  i blame it on a sleepless weekend   thanks 
sorry elispse has opened up 
my hostname does not contain a dot  yes epmd is the same session  that's what's confusing me a bit because log output says he couldn't reach epmd  but epmd log says otherwise  i tried running again with my hostname changed to "lemen" and with no network connected but still yields the same result 
this works for me   theking laptop  make sure you're using the latest nightly build  as an aside and for others that may come to this  initially when i put this in place  it appeared that io format was not being redirected to the shell  furthermore it seemed that any spawned processes were no longer receiving messages  although no error was returned   however after restarting eclipse and ensuring any open erl exe processes were stopped  it's now working correctly  thanks for putting this project together 
no  i don't need otp 18  just for documentation purpose  i think i can stay with otp 16 for now

hi major  the query it seems to hang on is  select engine sum data_length  count engine  from information_schema tables where table_schema not in  'information_schema' 'mysql'  and engine is not null group by engine order by engine asc i'm going to leave it running for a while and see what happens  might just be a case of it taking a long time to run 
what kind of feedback do you expect 
i checked on mysql 5 5 and 5 6  variables are 
yep  escaping the character solved it  though i suppose it should probably do the escape in the script if possible  catching the error and printing a message might be nice as well  just some thoughts  thanks  ghan
 std gnu99 works great for the compiling  the linker error still occurs of cause

you mean that from today everybody need to install libpng and it's not declared as dependency in the package json  because until today everything was working fine  i'm just trying to figure out where is the problem exactly  many thanks

hi russh  i actually want to export the activities as a report  i have a great need of actions in this page  kindly request you to guide me 
yes  thanks mike  p s  aren't you planning to create a mailing list  say  a google group  for those like me who ask questions that are not twython bugs    
which means you always intended to leave out the testsuite from the tarball  fine
in my code  i use head to track where user at like in git  so i have branches  i can checkout a commit  and branch from it  the way i am doing it is to make 'head' point to a commit  then create a branch pointing commit  'head' as a symbolic reference pointing to branch  exactly the same work flow as in git  what i am doing now is   which works for memory repo  the code is ugly because i am touching the internal implementation of refs  one reason i have to do this is that i've set head to by symbolic reference to 'refs heads master'  there aren't any function to set 'head' without following it  maybe there are  i just don't know   
well  this change didn't fix the issue of unclosed files  i'm trying a new code that is not using corrupted files on commit    on windows system such errors happen very often on a app that rums for a few hours  we are now using a dirty method that will create a temporary new repository if such an error occours  btw we had the same issue with pygit2 
python 2 7 9 via virtualenv on arch linux  using dulwich installed via  pip install git+git   github com jelmer dulwich  
i believe i am using 0 9 9  but i think the offending line is still present master client py 230   if i understand  add_pack does not support thin packs  while add_thin_pack does  but gets called a little differently 
i was trying to use dulwich on my internal stash gitblit environment  and get that error  i used to fork a repo to my own repo  and got that style link
that works  thanks 
git status reports "nothing to commit"  git log shows both commits 
the most recent issue i've been running into was with porcelain push   correctly failing  all the exception handling is done in a different area of the code though  so i don't have access to the original handle  is there any downside that you know of to just closing the repo immediately after creating it like i have above 
i was not able to perform the post operation  with json in the request body  realized that i have to additionally specify a content type in the request header with its value set to application json  charset utf 8  btw this is gr8 add on for quick rest url development and testing   hussain

hi william ferguson  i updated the project to use 4 0 0 r3  i am working on some jar sdk like android jar  well  i have the same problem  when i use build helper plugin to generate jar it does not include classes from aar dependencies  i use maven shade plugin to add all dependencies   groupid org apache maven plugins  groupid   artifactid maven shade plugin  artifactid  the aar file contains all dependencies  but jar doesn't  do you know some work around  how to convert aar to jar 
i have 3 projects  a  b and c  a    jar b    aar  depends on a  c    apk  depends on b  have i to repack the project a into an aar to work with it  that would be bad  because in the same maven run should be built the server project 
 mvn clean install  got failed with the error  'xxx classes jar' is missing
i'll try tomorrow  but a test project could be better  isn't it 
 mosabua yes  i had this working a year or more ago too  but it seems jenkins changed parsing of test reports  in the new project installed newest version of jenkins  will check their xml schema and get back 
link to example project https   drive google com file d 0b4qkt517zpe7zjqxxzj4cvc1dwm view i also added full logs  you can see them  that  created dummy classes jar  is before clean

hi devinrader  thanks for getting back to me  if a twilio account authenticates through a 3rd party website  the accountsid that the 3rd party site receives is actually a subaccount to the master account  this subaccount has no direct access to any other numbers or messages that the master account has  though various api calls i have managed to retrieve the master account sid and i am able to utilise that as the resourcesid  as specified in the twilioclient constructor  to query received text messages however the same cannot be done for sending text messages  hope this clears up the confusion  many thanks
this is request validation as per recommendation from twilio 
this issue was moved to php memcached dev php memcached#332
i have used memcached 1 4 36 installed from  brew  on macos 
we  cassandra  actually  specifically  observed a reduced overhead in the last few days from performance patches rolled out by aws  it definitely helped  but it's still now top of mind so i figured i'd bring it up  i don't believe we've seen the end of the changes  either  besides  i think it's still a good change to make in the longer run to increase efficiency under load  i wouldn't worry about doing too much on vacation  enjoy the time off    i can spend the time grokking the buffer management in the binary protocol 
what is the default distribution cache server limits if i want to increase 4 6 what needs to be done  each connection limit is 20 it works fine for 4 server and if we configure 6 th one randamoly disconnecting from one of the server 
whm  yum i have solved this problem with custom bash script  chkserv d get false response and it restart memcached each 5 15 minutes

sorry  don't remember the module depending on  node glob   honestly  i don't even remember which project was that  we had to manually edit glob js and move function definitions on top  for example   the way  lstatcb  defined is not ecma  friendly   the scope issue becoming even more stricter with es6 classes  hopefully not but if putting up a sample code that throws an error is the only way for a change  i will try to find some space for it

wow that was fast  let me take a look at the tests  but it redirects to resource_url instead of the one i'm providing on successful resource creation  on my app  
i doubt it as well    yes  we're using haml for the html  latest git version as well  heres the relevant ections form the app's gemfile   i'll try to create a minimal test case to reproduce and report back  thanks a 10 6 for the quick response 
my ar#to_json was private and i always had "missing template error"  i've looked at source code of your plugin and found these undefs and commented them  after restaring server i've noticed  that my ar#to_json is private  i've changed this method to public and got systemstackerror  after uncommenting undefs i've forgotten to restart server  after restarting it works just fine  so  there is no problem to redeclare model to_json method  but i still can't understand  why we need these lines vendor gems inherited_resources 1 0 6 lib inherited_resources legacy responder rb  # undefine  to_json and  to_yaml since it's defined on object undef_method  to_json  if method_defined   to_json  undef_method  to_yaml  if method_defined   to_yaml 
i haven't tried that  although i really would like this on a case by case basis  not globally 
i'll try  directory  usr share vim vim72 keymap contains keymap files  which we can invoke in such a way  set keymap hebrew_utf 8 or set keymap russian jcukenwin etc  and this will change the variable b  keymap_name   to switch to this national keymap  set iminsert 1  by default iminsert 0  or using default hotkey  ctrl +    that do the same  then we can see that instead of some national letters we get "pairs"  delimitmate overrides maps from keymap  
thanks  sorry for the sloppy explanation  i do not know english  i used the google translator 
yes  i use sessions in connection with the ctrl space plugin  but i explicitely tell it when to save a session and when to load it  now autocmd's involved with respect to sessions 
it definitely looks like it  good catch  i suppose i shall try to fix it there or at least ping them on it  edit  and since this isn't a delimitmate bug  i'll close this 
ok  i was just surprised when i accidentally did that  that i did not get a runtime exception  it does make sense that the second will win  though it does not really make sense to call it twice in the same constructor 
sorry   when i say 'then i get an exception' i mean that i  quite rightly  get object not set to an instance of an object     but that's in 'my' code   not using persistencespecification

i'm running my own gnu linux based os  is you are asking about gcc version then 4 7 2 currently  if i only knew what is not compiled with  fpic but its unclear to me  doesn't ffi gem compile libffi itself 
they appear to be within the python code  not within their internal libffi copy  https   github com python cpython blob 656d52dbfde3223cd2a3525d652b6cccb02fa991 modules _ctypes callproc c#l1032 https   github com python cpython blob 656d52dbfde3223cd2a3525d652b6cccb02fa991 modules _ctypes callproc c#l1136 the code simply creates a new private local variable scope for holding data it expects will be pass by reference  where the determination is based on variable size  the ctypes_pass_by_ref_hack is enabled purely on architecture+abi type #ifdefs   and apparently upstream python devs weren't aware of cases beyond x86 and aarch64  or  more likely  they simply didn't have enough build platforms to test other cases  
okay  how exactly am i supposed to fix this  should i post this on my buildozer issue 
yes  apologies  i should have done that initially  i'm working on it now  and of course my minimal example works fine    it might take me a bit to identify what aspect of my architecture is triggering the issue  i have found that the issue occurs when the server is run in python 2 7 12 but  not  when it is run in python 3 5 2  rpyc 3 4 0 in both cases   and it only occurs after a client connects  i'll keep working on a minimal example 
yes  thank you 
i've done some more digging and found the root cause  my system is running a server queue  rpyc  and a worker daemon that queries the queue for data  i made a change recently that caused the rpyc connection to be copied to processes spawned by the worker  so the worker and all processes were using the same connection instance   i fixed the issue by having each spawned process create its own rpyc connection instead of sharing it  closing this issue as ebkac 
that would mean that we'll loose the value  the method could monkey patch the object and replace the getter property with string field  or the exception could be a netref for remote object  like any other object we receive  best would be to fully deserialize the object and have its exact copy  i'm not familiar enough with this project yet  to know if it's feasible and or safe enough  weird thing is that this happens only for exceptions defined in installed packages  not project ones 
thank you  that fixed it 
 comrumino weird  i was able to reproduce this issue in multiple envs  have you executed the exact python code as i did

i'm not especially knowledgeable on this  but for sure serving files is wh connections  which is an important limitation  there are a few complications though  1  portability  both sendfile 2  and the accompanying tcp_cork option are linux only 2  it doesn't seem to fit cohttp's current  stream based  model regarding  2   after a quick look  this is the first time i look at cohttp's code  so take it with a grain of salt  i believe it might be possible to change both  cohttp_lwt_body t   so that it can be a reference to a file reifiable as a regular stream  and the output channels used elsewhere in order to perform a sort of stream fusion and replace the read file into stream   write stream to socket operations into a single sendfile loop  this sounds quite involved  so for the time being simply allocating a string buffer and reusing it  with  lwt_io read_into   would help a lot  i assume that nobody expects the strings returned by the stream to be immutable  this could be documented in the corresponding interface  
i think i filed that in the wrong bt  i think  ocaml base64  should change its module name  it came after  extlib   maybe  b64   
awesome  here is the run with cohttp lwt 
 rgrinberg sorry you're right  i just feel like i've been filling out bug tickets literally every day lately  i greatly appreciate cohttp and the effort the dev team puts into it 
sorry for the incomplete report  mac  newest sierra version  with brew  when trying to build in the opam build directory  it turns out it is a linking error   adding   cclib  l usr local opt openssl lib  to the  cohttp_server_lwt native  build command succeeded 
i'm trying that now  opam  or rather   git   i think  complains that it can't find a remote helper for  git+https  so i'm trying to figure out how to solve that first 
you're right in that it doesn't happen on the current release of psych  1 2 2 from what i can tell  but you need to declare the gem dependency or it won't happen  if activerecord listed  psych  as a dependency this would've been avoided because  presumably  it would have fetched the most recent version  the one bundled with ruby 1 9 2 p290 is  sadly  broken  it has to be manually added in the  gemfile  to fix this  ruby 1 9 3 p0 is bundled with psych 1 2 1 which produces a slightly different error  but at least no hard crash   the 1 2 2 version is fine in 1 9 3  though  thanks for the prompt reply  it would be great if the next build of 1 9 3 will have 1 2 2 or better bundled with it as this is probably going to hit more than a few unsuspecting people

hi  tenderlove thank you for the reply  i installed p194  i have a new error now 
thanks  i upgraded rubygems  but the problem persisted  i eventually resorted to going to a backup disk for my virtual machine  i'm running ubuntu on oracle virtualbox   before i had seen your suggestion  sorry  i should have updated my issue  but it was a maddening several days trying to fix the problem  i'll make sure to try updating bundler and rubygems if i see this issue again  thanks for responding 
oh  i was using the standard psych packed with ruby 1 9 3p448  when i added psych to my gemfile  the problem indeed was fixed  thanks 
but the main way i see the problem is when http   github com flavio jump tries to load its config file… i just used pry to investigate the problem 
hi  thanks for your fast reply  so i downloaded and compiled libyaml from the github repo  here  https   github com yaml libyaml   then i used the   run load c  test  https   github com yaml libyaml blob master tests run loader c  to load a sample file with the yaml snippet above and it fails  i e  once compiled  i run the test like this     run load test yaml    but when i use  psych load_file    in pure ruby to load the same file  it succeeds  i would expect the same behaviour i e  both failing to load the file  let me know if you need more details  thanks

thanks for your reply  i think this race condition is "possibility"  it will not happens easily  a possible situation is when uploading a log file in  var log    httpclient first determines the file size of the log file    some daemon appends a new entry to the log file    httpclient read the content of the log file  it results the file size and the content size httpclient read can differ  or  some user may executes "cat  dev urandom   file_to_upload" for unknown reason  and upload 'file_to_upload' while the command is running  anyway  the problem is the difference between the file size httpclient determined and the content size httpclient read  if httpclient determined the file size is n bytes  then httpclient should read only n bytes  not read until eof  to simulate this situation  i made a following testcase   after applying the patch i posted  the testcase can be passed  thanks 
things are working now  thank you 
thanks guys  really appreciate the fix  and well  premailer  what can i say  it's an amazing tool and that makes my work much more enjoyable 
yes i have the build tools  unless some new dependencies have been added in the new version  the previous version installed without any problem 
i've tried to find it  but without any luck  i think it was some invalid byte sequence  like  x0   
yes
hi  we've been running on 3 2 0 since then  so i haven't looked into it any more  so for now  i'll just close it  and when we look into upgrading again i'll investigate and see if i can reproduce it 
it's a commercial product and i'm not sure if i can send you source code 
 pehrgit   no  i just changed my class  barprovider  to use generics  something like  barprovider tkey  tvalue   which has a concurrentdictionary and get and create methods  and in ninjectconfig i'm using like this   i would like to ninject do this for me  but i noticed last release of ninject was long time ago and i think the maintainers could take too much time to release another version  so i did it myself and closed the issue 
 scott xu not that i'm aware of  and the search also didn't yield any results  but it's a quite common approach when running on  net framework   4 6 to polyfill  asynclocal 
no deadlocks  inspected both manually and with sosex in windbg   after adding ninject symbols  the problem seems to be related to domain unloading here https   github com ninject ninject blob master src ninject modules assemblynameretriever cs#l60 appdomain unload never returns  i don't fully understand why would it hang indefinitely  according to the docs if domain cannot be unloaded cannotunloadappdomainexception is thrown after a period of time  whatever that means  but i am using it's not hours  
i'm on ubuntu 14 0 4  aubio 0 4 1 compiled from source 
nope i dont have git installed  maybe thats my problem  is there a way to get the python module installed without first installing git 
ok  great  it looks like that fixed it  thank you 
if i recall  i used the git installation instructions  it might be worth noting i am running a macbook pro sierra  i did find if i used a smaller audio file  it works  but generally locks up the processes for a couple minutes before it completes

because there are multiple kinds of warnings the user would want to enable or disable 
if it is _always_ ignored  it can be used for data  i'm not sure if it is  that being said  writing a test rom to check that is yet another case where you wouldn't want automatic nop insertion 
thanks for the quick response  it helped  but there are more of these around 
scratch that  i think when i ran into this i was indenting sections of code with labels  which i guess are supposed to be unintended anyway  it's a little odd that the error thrown is about macros  but it's ultimately not a huge deal  feel free to close this issue 
sure  i have instance of an object in a rails view  example  object to_json #     "id"  1  "name"  "nick"  "age"  999  "created_at"  "2006 08 01"  "awesome"  true  running my feature in cucumber is returning #object 0x108b97ba8
well  by looking through the code i can't see it used anywhere  and if you simply hard code default_charset to e g "utf 8" in the #mime_types_info   record  yaws hrl   then recompile all code and run a http request like  content type  text html i would expect to get back  content type  text html  charset utf 8 as the docs state  default_charset   charset defines the default charset to be added when a response content  type is text    by default  no charset is added  note  a workaround until this is solved could of course be to use the extra_response_header callback to append a charset for any outgoing 'content type' header

yes  i tried databasecleaner  mongoid  strategy    truncation  it failed  now i am using v0 5 2 with config   databasecleaner orm   "mongoid" databasecleaner strategy    truncation it works 
i think your suggestion makes a lot of sense  mongoid doesn't support removing indexes but mongodb does so you'd have to drop down to the driver level  when i get a chance i'll take a look and see if i can get something working

a sample request from http   muffin doit org docs rfc tunneling_ssl html  connect home netscape com 443 http 1 0 user agent  mozilla 1 1n proxy authorization  basic agvsbg86d29ybgq  i can get a dump  but from the sample it is pretty obvious what the problem is    the parser fails when it encounters the first period in the hostname as it assumes it is parsing the schema  not the hostname  i guess an easy fix would be to skip directly to _s_req_host state_ instead of _s_req_schema_ iff the request is a connect

 ev ermakov i know that antlr could be used to parser sql statement  what i meant here is the low level parser and the input to the parser is extracted from tcp payload  just like http parser  the input to the parser could be a buffer extracted from tcp payload and we do not need to consider the network stack in the parser  the most valuable things in http parser is the state machine and we can register the calback function in different state 
yep  we tried doing the same thing with test credentials in python's helper library as well as making a curl request and they both worked

i think the problem may be that i am trying to send information too quickly  i am trying to send 4 integers  comma delimited  at about 200 hz frequency  when i slow down the cycle time the problem does not seem to occur  do you think this might be what was causing problems 
i know what the problem was  i had the transmitting rate too slow  hence  causing the led to hardly flash and my room was too bright to actually realize it was flashing  once i increased the trandmitting rate it all works fine

 self classpower forceupdate    did it  i had tried it last night but i think i mistakenly typed  self classpower forceupdate    is it expected to need to force an update after an enable  should'int the enable call be calling an update 
sure i'll give it a shot this evening  thanks for the quick response 
yes  your examples do with ie7  removing the noconflicts also removes the error     when digging around to find why i had this error  when i saw your comment about nconflict on post http   easyxdm net wp 2011 04 13 microsoft security bulletin ms11 018   i thought it couldn't be it 
okay  i'm sorry  i was a little confused about your test demo versions  not to mention it would be great if you continue tagging your versions   http   easyxdm net dev tests  says it's 2 4 12   and fails flashtransport in my ff 4 0 1  seems like every time  http   easyxdm net current tests  says it's 2 4 14   and passes everything there  seems like every time   except for the tests not meant to pass while testing locally  i missed the subdomains  so everything matches your tests at the moment  sorry for the confusion again  however  i'm banging my head against the wall with my own project  which stopped working in ie7 for the obvious reason   i'm testing both in ie7 and chrome  by forcing protocol  "6"   the last thing easyxdm debug prints is "   storing function flash_loaded   "  i see easyxdm swf is loaded successfully via network pane  and then  nothing happens  nothing at all  not a request to get the remote document  in particular  yes  i have swf loaded from the same domain i'm trying to load my remote from   any hint will be appreciated 
i can confirm this issue is fixed in the current master  thanks oyvindkinsey

matthewthe  thanks for your advice   it did solve the problem that i made the protein name format in database exactly the same with that in percolator input file  thanks again 
we detect co isolated peptides  meaning there are multiple peptides matched to a single spectrum  is this want you mean by "psms from the same spectrum"  it shouldn't be an issue then  since if i only switch two scan numbers where both appear exactly once  i still get different ranking  we do not use target decoy competition  i was running this command   i'll try to come up with a minimal example 
you're right  if i run it straight up on the mzid file i get the same error  attached is the mzid   which works fine in 3 1   perco3 4_error mzid txt  https   github com percolator percolator files 4064160 perco3 4_error mzid txt 
yep  when i try to load the file  i'm using version 1 0 beta 43  just downloaded yesterday 
hm it seems "countries" gem had some progress in the last years     i am using a custom branch  with some subdivisions added by myself  in order to switch to the actual hexorx version all of these subdivisions should be merged into the "original" one  yours   is that possible to make a pull request   all my added stuff is conform to the one of hexorx 
docs says  "timeframed manager that returns only objects for whom the current date time lies within their time range " modelclass timeframed all   returns all timeframedmodels that have 'start' and 'end' dates  but i really don t understand how to express mentioned in docs query  which return  filter  models for whom the current date time lies within their time range 
resolved  thank man

beyond some of the basic benefits of docker  repeatable installations and deployment  isolation from other processes   i've found it most useful if you want to use roundhouse within a larger docker deployment  for example  within a docker compose   note that this doesn't mean that  installation  of roundhouse in the docker image couldn't leverage the  net core tools installation option   i built my image before that option was available

 philnash  thanks for the response  the call returns a  none  in python  i e  no exception or anything   and the channel in question is not updated  here is a slightly more detailed example of what i meant   using  type  instead of  type  in the kwargs has the same effect

sir actually my application concept is based on voice and video features  but when i used this with two library then gradle is return duplicate library issue error that's why i am trying this common library but this library also return this apache issue implementation 'com twilio video android 4 2 0' implementation 'com twilio voice android 3 1 0' error  execution failed for task ' app transformdexarchivewithexternallibsdexmergerfordebug'  learn how to resolve the issue at https   developer android com studio build dependencies#duplicate_classes  program type already present  org webrtc contextutils and when i exclude this then showing another duplicate_classes please suggest me any suggestion to use both features together in application
i was not able to reproduce the issue myself either  i tried send multiple update event one after another  but that always results in 400 or 404s  i'm not really sure when or why 204s are happening  my assumption is that it could be a race condition where the server accepts the update event and verifies that that task is updatable  but when it comes time to update it cannot be updated because something moved it to a delete or a un updatable state since 204s are returned for deletes  if you can help look into when and why 204s are being return that would be great  does your api team have an idea why this is happening

yes i do  all directories in my project have an  __init__ py  file 
actually  i spoke to soon  i thought i had an issue with django nose that maybe the update adressed  but turned out i was building my virtualenv against python 3 0 instead of 2 7 
the solution was to run the following  thus despite having productmodel under myapp tests test_model py  it was found by django_nose this way  and only this way 
you mean the test suite  maybe it would help if i first knew if this was change was intentional  been through the changelogs

i've finally figured it out  our write panel was named shows so i changed the name of the write panel to show and what do you know  it shows the correct month  just to be sure i went ahead and created another write panel set to page without any fields or groups and sure enough dec is selected as the publish month on a new page  does this replicate for you  if not then maybe it has something to do with dreamhost or the install  though none of our other write panels have problems

hi  i wrote a storage for gloria tv  it provides a  www  uri to the video and a  http  uri to the mp4  this way  i can access the video using the html5 + jwplayer  gloria tv does not provide flash url like youtube or dailymotion   youtube  or  dailymotion  scheme  best_link_uri prefers  http  over  www   youtube storage does not provide direct access to mp4  but only  swf and www uri  thus  best_link_uri  fallback to  www  with those storage  in the templates  we should prefer  www  uri over  http  and  download   this is the algorithm of  web_uri   unlike  best_link_uri    regards  and happy new year     
the closest i could find is  http   bugs python org issue5573  which you even commented on    notice in that case poll   returns true because there's data to read  but in my example it never returns true  because no data has been sent  so if you don't ever call recv   you don't get the eoferror  an if you do call recv   it just hangs   i worked around this by patching the pipe to check for a parent pid change in poll   and raise an eoferror in that case but a proper fix might be needed so that poll   detects that the other end of the pipe is closed  couldn't find anything in the documentation for pipes on linux that would suggest this is possible though

we worked around the problem by removing yet more ruby 1 9 hash syntax  i'd overlooked some parts that were buried in deep in javascript  grosser  is there a purer ruby ruby_parser than this pure ruby ruby_parser     i saw 3 0 0 seems to have been released yesterday      perhaps i can try with that  zenspider  the problem disappared when we used  foo    'true' instead of  foo    true in a hash that gets turned to json by  to_json  i think for the json part it won't matter that we use strings since true and false are handled as strings there anyway  but i'll see if i can run the rake task again against the older revision to get a stack trace

i'm happy to answer your question  but i should warn you that my use case may be a little different than most users  as my first priority is compliance with some fairly strict anti spam legislation that has just been introduced  the sensible approach for me is the one which best ensures that no one can end up as a confirmed subscriber without having requested it themselves  these are the pros of django newsletter as i see them    user confirmation is required   no user specific subscribe and unsubscribe urls are present in the newsletters  if a newsletter is forwarded by recipient  there is no exposure to the subscribe unsubscribe mechanism for the original recipient   each step is auditable   initial subscription request  confirmation email sent  url accessed with user specific activation code  unsubscribe requested etc if "it's dangerous" offers benefits without impacting the points above  then it sounds sensible to me  in my case  though  i'd sooner lose the ability for a recipient to change their email address at all  and instead make them unsubscribe address 1 and subscribe address 2  than to compromise in other areas  however  this would be a degraded user experience  and may not sit well with most of your user base  with that said  i'm not sure that it has to be one or the other  i think re triggering the confirmation process when a user requests to change their email address would be sufficient  when accessing the "activate" url  i don't think the email address field is required  as the activation code would be unique to each user  and the email address could be gleaned from this database record 
yes  i have sites activated   i can pick one from the select box  it's django 1 6 
thanks  finally i got it working  i was using gmail in my settings file and sender as someone from my website so it was going to spam folder  that leads to another question  is there any way i can have multiple settings for multiple newsletters   and depending on which newsletter is being sent it picks up right settings   is that a possibility    thanks  sent from my iphone
that makes sense  i went back and forth on this a lot because i think robust thumbnailing is outside the scope of this package  but it is an important performance consideration  i like the idea of approaching this as the text editor  users have options to use more robust technologies as needed  but the system provides workable fallbacks if they opt not to use any of them  i will however need to do some more thinking on this  i am trying to wrap my head around a way we could dynamically declare a field type for the image  field of the  article  model  but not trigger django to create a migration with  makemigrations   i think if we initialize django with a different field type name it is going to try and create a migration to update the field  most thumbnail packages i am aware of seem to all inherit from the django  imagefield   so i am trying to see if there is a way we could declare that model field as an  imagefield  for django initialization and migrations and then have it dynamically update based details in  settings py   in theory this could work  because all these fields are really just adding additional methods to the class  they shouldn't be impacting details at the database level  if we can get past that hurdle  i think the other areas  e g  actually using the thumbnailer in the template   should be fairly straightforward  relatively speaking

hey mac  as far as i am aware per postgres docs there is at least an absence of direction on that being an available function of the    alter   create   schema  commands  for the per db issue  i might imagine the user would create the  tablespace  on the db they choose  then in bucardo when adding the db's there could be an option for  tablespace   since ultimately tablespace's don't matter to anything but the postgres db it would only be an indicator to the bucardo service to create the tables on the db in question in said tablespace  example 
it is 3 10 0    but the but to be clear there are no column names with unusual characters  just one with a default value of a bicycle emoji and others containing all variety of user text

you're absolutely right  there is no need in use_setuptools   and default_url found in setuptools ez_setup at all  the dependencies can be resolved in setup py using   install_requires    moreover  the hardcoded distribute version is quite old 0 6 14 while the fresh one is 0 7 3  so answering your question  yes

thanks     i actually didn't know that simple navigation didn't support dynamic list of items     i kind of assumed it did  i've been using links this way for the last 3 versions or so  only when i got the error i went to the website and read "well  dynamic content is kindof an alpha feature now"  and i was like "dude  i've been doing this for 3 releases now"  d regarding your questions  i use current_navigation in a couple places  but in general i use auto_highlighting  in other words  i just let highlight be  and it works   when i updated to 3 0 0 i had to include an initializer  or i would get an 'undefined method' error  after including the initializer  the 'undefined error' was gone  but i got the 'invalid level' error  i'll have to look at issue 10 at some point in time  specially since you mention that config files might stop being re interpreted on each call in the future  meanwhile  since i'm using simple navigation in a couple  small  production sites  i'm downgrading back to 2 7 1  i'm not comfortable commenting out lines on gems i'm using  now seriously   what does the "level specified for item not found" error mean  i'm really curious 
i'll try 
thanks  andi  completely missed that 
thanks totally does it

tried it on my devo server  ubuntu  after my macbook  the problem persists  maybe it does have to do with my bundler + gem + ruby combination  the versions are given below     ruby 1 9 2p136  2010 12 25   x86_64 linux  gem 1 3 7 bundler version 1 0 7 everything works after i fix the file  in my case  usr local lib ruby gems 1 9 1 specifications redis rack 1 4 1 gemspec  manually   where i convert #syck  defaultkey 0x00000103057e28 into    the changed file become like this    i see the same problem  #syck etc    mentioned in another issue https   github com jodosha redis store issues 91 which i have referred  i will update my bundler  gem and ruby combination to see if it goes away

the section tag doesn't enclose anything in the generated document  that's the job of static content surrounding the section tag   so if you indent within it you're creating pointless extra indent levels  alternately  don't indent section tags with respect to the surrounding static content  and do indent the text inside the section  
 bladeoflight16   yes  you right   if you set this option before executing psake  then error occur  "the variable ' buildtoolsversions' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set" usually i set both of them  so i confused about real cause of error

hi  nope  i'm still getting the same issue with the latest rss py
that's what i thought too  but somehow i had convinced myself that the  simile  method invoked  here  https   github com andk pause blob master lib pause pmfile pm#l253  effectively excludes packages from the index if the package name doesn't actually match the file name  now that i look around  i see lots of packages in the index that don't match the file name  so my original premise is obviously wrong  but now i'm completely confused about what the  simile  thing means

i am moving all machines to the new autoproj version  i will report if i got the problem again and try to debug it 
thx  for the link  i will try on the next machine  however  the install script is a bit non standard  maybe the following workflow is a bit cleaner   this handles a lot of use cases like    someone installed autoproj as a global gem   someone called gem install autoproj to upgrade because there is a newer version on the web which is not picked up  no self upgrade to v2 
possible   we can close it and if i get the error again i can have a closure look

we're setting up sprockets to process html ish things on the asset pipeline for use with angularjs   you can put a  foo html haml  in the rails assets folder  and it will render the haml into html and turn that html into a javascript blob that directly inserts the template into angular's template cache  we also print the  markups  array in a javascript comment to let the user know what extensions have been registered and will be processed 
how would i go about getting the invoice link from the transaction object 
suppose my app is called foo  i created foo js and move the javascript from application js into foo js and then included foo js as the last file leaving application js empty except for the includes   let me know if that is too vague and i'll elaborate

i am afraid i cannot share the document on which i can easily reproduce the problem right now  i have tested on  a blank template  https   github com ataiya latex_siggraph_template   and there it doesn't occur 
hi rene  thanks for the reply  i changed the latex rb file to the commit mentioned  now the error shows "could not locate any file named bibliography"  you are right  it seems textmate 2 cannot locate the bib file  however i have a   tex root defined in the particular file  the path is correct  also i did not change the bibinputs variable in textmate  i noticed in the changelogs and issues that there have been some updates to the citations  but could not figure it out why my previously working project cannot locate the bib file anymore  it is still there on its original location  in the project folder      any ideas 
it seems to be simply a problem when the filename is multiple words with a space  if i save your mwe with the name 'test test tex' then run texcount from the bundle i get the same error  but on a file with a single word filename the command runs fine  the texcount script is obviously not properly capturing the name in quotes

hi  i post more information here http   github com toastdriven django haystack issues #issue 133 and i'm still try to find out the answer  now i have figured out the reason of the 1st problem which is the end_offset issue  in xapian_backend searchquery run about line 991 where set the end_offset  if self end_offset is not none  kwargs 'end_offset'    self end_offset   self start_offset the end_offset was subtracted by start_offset  but later when get the result  xapian_backend searchbackend search about line 355  matches   enquire get_mset start_offset   end_offset   start_offset   the end_offset will be substracted again by start_offset  so i think the end_offset should not be substracted by start_offset the first place  but besides this one still have the slice issue  thanks   
thanks  i'll update the backend in a day or two  and watch it for a while

well  the thinking was simply to be able to override the defproc on   _attributes  which we are doing currently for lazy bulk load or also perhaps have this be something other than a  hash   in any case it's just a good practice to allow the client to create the container  also i was eyeing how to implement  serialized  without overriding or replacing  ohm  model#attribute  declarator  since you call  cast    this is sufficient if  cast  is a  proc  or convertible to a  proc   thus we could parameterize the serializer per attribute as currently  suggest you add   args  as a third parameter to the  attribute  declarator and also use  class_eval  to define the accessors rather than  define_method  since  class_eval  called methods benchmark much faster

thanks for the response    generally  it's on the "back and forward" buttons that my code seems to get errors   any idea why this would be   i e  basically if i refresh the page it works no problem  but as soon as go back or forward then i get js errors from lab like  uncaught typeerror  object  object object  has no method 'imagesloaded'  i have defined some scripts on my  master page  like  var commonload    lab  script 'script1 js'  wait     script 'script2 js'  wait     script 'script3 js'    then i use on the page im working on  commonload  script 'relies on commonload js'  wait    wait function       some code      however  when i use the back and forward buttons   i get errors   all i am doing is loading code via  jquery    which applies to the page images   is this something related to caching maybe or the dom not being ready or   can't understand why    p s   why oh why can't github move "comment   close" to  float left      or near "close issue"  p 
 getify  i have not fixed any indenting issues  this is a direct copy out of chrome's console   sans the filename line number  also  there is nothing else after this output  other than chrome complaining about quantcast's js not serving with the right mime type  if you need expanded view on the referenceerror object  i can get you that as well  if you can tell me what i'm doing wrong  i will greatly appreciate it  thanks 
the "main js" should be loaded after jquery  not before it  but according to ie debugger it is not happening  sometimes it is loaded right  but most of the time   wrong 
hey getify  thanks for responding so quickly  below is our setup  which we did not change when we upgraded from 1 2 to 2 0   lab ready function with a check for myfunction which is in promo js  loaded with  lab   we use  lab ready quite a bit on our homepage  to ensure proper sequencing as the page is mainly a header footer with a big unstructured content area  so with the above setup  when we went to version 2 0  our page load times increased by 1 second over a large dataset  so we reverted to 1 2  but are taking the hit with the ie10 issue  in ie10  the reference to if myfunction  is returning an error   myfunction is undefined  so the biggest issue for us is figuring out what was causing the increase in page load times 
thank you very much  we've known where the problem is and will take time to rewrite the code  labjs is good to use 
wow  i knew that you still provide support for the library but wasn't expecting so quick response  thanks  i'm using v2 0 3  here's the test on the web  http   www data diggers com test test html note  it gets even bit more stranger  in opera 9 63 if i hit refresh the script executes as expected  but if i just load it again  type the address again without refreshing it   the script misbahaves and wait   body is executed immediately  maybe it's caching issue  it seems that if the script is cached control to  wait   is passed right away without waiting for script execution to finish

in buildout 2 0  you can add an  update versions file  option will update the specified file with the versions of all packages used if they weren't explicitly specified  not quite sure how this would work with mr developer  but the general idea would be to add the  rev   or similar option for sources where it's not specified  this is more complicated with mr developer since there's not a separate section where versions are specified  not really sure if this idea makes sense  but i thought i would throw it out there  i would find it helpful to ensure the same revision is installed every time  thinking about it more though  i think it might make sense just to issue a warning if a revision isn't specified or perhaps have an option to error out in that scenario

the  image_extractor rb  uses graphics magick  which indeed supports specified page extraction  unfortunately the  page_extractor rb   or the corresponding  docsplit pages   docsplit extract_pages  command uses pdftk  which does not support specified page extraction  it really isn't that high of a concern as i believe i have an extremely unique scenario  but the  online documentation  http   documentcloud github com docsplit   claims that it does support specifying a page range  if you'd like i could write a test that fails  but i'm still researching the best way to include support for this

back in june 2010 the css declaration was like this    hd  bd  ft overflow hidden _overflow visible  _zoom 1   and i never encounter the issue
yep  as for example identica user and password     
sure http   gist github com 481056 the reason i throw in the strategy is because i wanted to set the unauthenticated path  is there another way to do that 
before working on any changes i just wanted to start a conversation  really  i'm not sure how this can be fixed without changing the api  at the very least  you could make passing   response  key in the options parameter to  throw   can you think of a way to approach this with minimal api changes that preserves access to the response body  i tried to write a patch at first in  manager rb  but quickly realized the  throw ers need to change  not  just  the  catch er 
your fix works thanks for your great work   
normally  when pressing ctrl+r it scrolls back in irb's history and do a reverse search   the prompt changes accordingly to "'reverse i search"  i hope it helps    regards yann

i've just had a look at the code  as far as i can see  there was no specific reason to rely on  self html  so i've refactored  transform    to just use its own  html  argument  and fall back to  self html  in case it's not given  
because those are not real releases  it does not include all files which we have in git

 mb21 sure  something like this is what i would have expected  expected output   hello expected docx  https   github com jgm pandoc files 3196717 hello expected docx  actual output   hello pandoc output docx  https   github com jgm pandoc files 3196709 hello pandoc output docx  source file  file ext  changed to txt so i could upload it to github    hello md txt  https   github com jgm pandoc files 3196712 hello md txt  even if there were just two or three levels of "big" parenthesis  it would be an improvement over just one level  i am not a latex expert  so i am not sure how many levels there are 
if i run  and then both the app po and app edit po files change to add new translations  and the only difference between them is the line  "pot creation date  2016 09 06 19 54+0100 n"  i'm really just wondering what purpose it serves to have both these files  or is one a backup file

i will check it again by disabling plugins one by one  i know that contextmenu_folder is different project  
sure my most recent failure  publicsuffix  domaininvalid   www ashlecrocker com' is not a valid domain  gem_root  gems public_suffix 1 4 4 lib public_suffix rb 68 in  parse

the latest from pip  since i'm still in the development face i haven't frozen the versions  so i'm not really sure where the error comes from  actually i tried 1 4 and the error was still there   so it's totally possible that it isn't this library  but right now i'm pretty lost as to what can be the culprit    i have tried connecting to redis master and redis slave from the server and a local image with redis package and it seems to work fine also
thank you very much for the response    here is the dpaste link to my traceback http   dpaste com 284828  i have a simple model defined like this  from django db import models import categories class game models model   title   models charfield max_length   255  slug   models slugfield max_length   255  description   models textfield   code   models textfield    i needed to define the fieldsets in the admin py  otherwise i get the error "unsupported operand type s  for +  'nonetype' and 'tuple' in admin py" whis has been addressed before and supposedly fixed  i am using version 0 4 7 
ah  that's solved it  is that documented anywhere 
i'm fairly certain that i did not  as i was playing around in the command line debugging another function that i fed the output tokens into  i was repeatedly using the same parser  if that's helpful to know at all  thanks for taking a look at this 
 part type     'type'  and  part type     'universal'  perhaps  well  'type' is maybe a bit odd  but that's what the  spec is using  http   www w3 org tr css3 selectors #selectors   with that change in place the if line would look like this   since that pseudo element is spec wise on a different level  it's kinda nice to have code which reflects this   i also renamed 'modifier' to 'subpart'   hope this makes sense

the agda programming language supports unicode for identifiers  this end up in latex code  because there is a special literate agda mode which allows mixing agda code with latex  this can be exported to a proper latex file with highlighting information for the agda code  small literate agda example  note the begin end code  commands    pre       snip      begin document   begin code  id   a → a id xₕ   xₕ  end code   end document    pre  this then gets translated into the following latex code   pre       snip      begin document   begin code      snip         agdafunction id   agdabound xₕ   agdasymbol     agdabound xₕ      snip       end code   end document    pre  there are some agda   helper functions used here  but basically the xₕ name ends up being used in math mode  it's quite common to use subscripts in the agda programming language  there are some workarounds  but from my point of view adding the subscripts to xits math would be the best option

hi  this error was with the latest version  i've read the bug reports of people having this issue with older versions  and the fact that this was fixed in ngx_echo v0 33+  thats why i posted this report   since the problem was with the most recent version of ngx_echo and nginx 1 0 11 
looking at one of the app servers i can see  in about 20 minutes  about 600 requests with undefined user agent from 91 different ips  multiply this for many servers we have and you can understand it's not an isolated issue  warning as quite continuous  the ips are spread all over the world  many from cloud providers  and we have no intention to stop the crawling  we run a rater important website and we have many crawlers fetching our pages  it's quite easy for me to workaround this  by checking the user agent in input and not call http  browserdetect when undefined  at the same time i expect websites of medium size to be crawled by any sort of bot  including bad ones with empty user agent  we don't want to block them  we use the version only for the usual browser edge cases  e g  ie  i do appreciate this module has many methods and i can see how hard it would be to change all of them  i'm happy to switch to public_version    i can see it works well for our case

so it looks like it is due to something that changed in hadoop 2 and when using the basic textfile method from spark it expects the input to be splittable  in my case the files are not indexed   discussed on  so  http   stackoverflow com questions 25248170 spark hadoop throws exception for large lzo files   anyway using the input format avoids this problem  should i close this issue 
well  even the  acl9  wiki  https   github com be9 acl9 wiki tutorial 3a linking object and subject with hmt  links to a page illustrating the various problems with habtm  https   coderwall com p 752fjw hmt associations with acl9 basically  habtm is fine if you use acl9 without needing anything else  but as soon as you want some basic additional data like  created_at  you need htm anyway so why not start with that  the other way around  what _does_ habtm give to this project that htm doesn't 
hi  julik  i did the same exact test on my mac and i can see the body printed so i'd assume the issue lies on webmock instead as you suggested  sorry for not thinking about it straight away  i'll close this pr and open a new one against webmock to get this fixed  unfortunately in my case i'm in the middle of rewriting faraday tests using webmock so it would be pointless to use webmock against faraday 😄  as i need to ensure that the faraday api correctly maps calls to the underlying adapter  as a quick fix i'll just disable the tests assuming everything is actually working outside of webmock  but hopefully we can get this fixed 👍 previous tests were using a mock server like the one you set up but as you can imagine they were much more complex and  especially  slower than the equivalent using webmock

hey  mvz   thank for your response  use case here is we are bound to use older ruby because other dependencies in the code  but development is done on modern platforms   fedora28  and that breaks  iconv rb  part of  gir_ffi  
the first thing i tried was putting the query string directly with the url  until i realized that url's were automagically encoded  the auto encoding is a nice feature  but i wonder if it could be narrowed a bit to avoid standard url components  at least in their expected places  the  q option would be a fairly simple work around if strategic url encoding is overkill or overly complex  off to play with resty some more

 oz123 yeah  i must have misread the documentation for upgrading for 0 5 x  the 0 5 x database i exported was not 'converted' into a 0 7 x compatible until i exported it from the 0 7 version and re importing it  afterwards everything started functioning as expected  in short    export 0 5 x database   import into 0 7   export from 0 7   import back into 0 7

makes sense    my issue is that i am copy pasting this task spec from the tutotial  https   github com knipknap spiffworkflow blob master doc tutorial nuclear json running complete_all   will complete the workflow even though some are defined as manual tasks with workflow_aborted getting trigger  how would i adjust the tutorial so that it would wait for the manual input on the exclusive choice 
after running the code  open 'workflow spec json'  'w'  write pretty   in serialilze py  the program outputs json string into workflow spec json  which i used in deserialize py  and the json string is "  "description "   " "   "file "  null   "name "   " "   "task_specs "    "start "    "class "   "spiffworkflow specs starttask starttask "   "data "       "defines "       "description "   " "   "id "  1   "inputs "       "internal "  false   "locks "       "lookahead "  2   "manual "  false   "name "   "start "   "outputs "    "general "    "post_assign "       "pre_assign "        "general "    "choice "  null   "class "   "spiffworkflow specs exclusivechoice exclusivechoice "   "cond_task_specs "      "spiffworkflow operators equal "     "attrib "   "confirmation "     "value "   "yes "      "president "     "data "       "default_task_spec "   "workflow_aborted "   "defines "       "description "   " "   "id "  2   "inputs "    "start "    "internal "  false   "locks "       "lookahead "  2   "manual "  false   "name "   "general "   "outputs "    "workflow_aborted "   "president "    "post_assign "       "pre_assign "        "nuclear_strike "    "class "   "spiffworkflow specs simple simple "   "data "       "defines "       "description "   " "   "id "  5   "inputs "    "president "    "internal "  false   "locks "       "lookahead "  2   "manual "  false   "name "   "nuclear_strike "   "outputs "       "post_assign "       "pre_assign "        "president "    "choice "  null   "class "   "spiffworkflow specs exclusivechoice exclusivechoice "   "cond_task_specs "      "spiffworkflow operators equal "     "attrib "   "confirmation "     "value "   "yes "      "nuclear_strike "     "data "       "default_task_spec "   "workflow_aborted "   "defines "       "description "   " "   "id "  4   "inputs "    "general "    "internal "  false   "locks "       "lookahead "  2   "manual "  false   "name "   "president "   "outputs "    "workflow_aborted "   "nuclear_strike "    "post_assign "       "pre_assign "        "workflow_aborted "    "cancel_successfully "  false   "class "   "spiffworkflow specs cancel cancel "   "data "       "defines "       "description "   " "   "id "  3   "inputs "    "general "   "president "    "internal "  false   "locks "       "lookahead "  2   "manual "  false   "name "   "workflow_aborted "   "outputs "       "post_assign "       "pre_assign "       "
i have added a simple server and client applications to reproduce most of the reported errors i got  since these sample functions don't do much could not get the hmget error but other issues are present  just start the server script and you will get the errors  no need to use the client script   texredisapi_issue_17 zip  https   github com fiorix txredisapi files 3647452 texredisapi_issue_17 zip  the two errors i got immediately after server start   txredisapi rediserror  not in transaction   txredisapi responseerror  err multi calls can not be nested

sure it's not really a bug  when i said it raised an error  it is just it enter the "except" pass  it was more a remark than a bug and or to add this in the doc   i e    if you erase the db then you have to rebuild or upload a new version

sry  for the late answer  i hadn't time yet to try   i only had a quick look at the css and as far as i have seen a monospace font is used and still somehow a few whitespaces are missing on the website but not if i go back to the editor  i'll give more info asap   but this can take a while   
i did it from irb   how can i load the library without  require 'css_parser'   the readme suggests that  too 
 postmodern thank you so much for answering  is it possible to follow external links and check if they are broken

thank you  mvidner that works very well   i even tried the sample script with 200 threads running in parallel and did not see any issues  will do more tests with puma  documenting this would be great as other people may hit this too  i don't know if we should close this issue or wait for documentation update  or if you have something else in mind

its just a tab order annoyance  i have it in a form for users to submit snippets  and if you are tabbing through the form  it takes focus and cannot be seen  so it is a little weird for users  i think that just redirecting the focus event is probably wise  i added a little piece of code that does it for me after i make a new codemirror  have not experienced any ill effects  out of curiosity how are you detecting "paste events"  i can paste into it using the context menu  but not with my normal paste method  most likely because i have emacs bindings in firefox  are you just checkout for ctrl+v or something 
i think this is related to how microsoft exchange server and javamail decide to negotiate security  the windows admin in my company gave me an smtp account for which no authentication is required  so  this is the code is was executing  p is alias for the postal core namespace   upon debugging i found that the user name and password are wrapped in a call to  str     which converts nil to blank strings  somehow  that triggers authentication between  javamail library and smtp server and i end up getting an exception as mentioned in the issue  i just changed the code to send nil as user name and password when they are nil  and it started working  on fri  feb 22  2013 at 4 44 pm  drew raines notifications github comwrote

hi andrew  i’ve never pushed before  so i should learn how to do that     i just monkey patched #38 for us  but around that i saw some other things  which i’d like to add improvements  while patches should only be cosmetic  fixing problems as much local as can be  i’m usually end up with some refactoring  it would be up to you  because this is your code  i looked into the query_and_build  query_api  make_request i believe this can be improved  i looks to me like a call chain where the responsibilities of building the request  sending the request  parsing the response and handling errors are all deeply buried  if found in query_api raise_unknown_resource path  if response code    "404" raise_authentication_error path  if response code    "401" raise_internal_server_error if response code    "500" but this does only cope with that specified errors  but not with others  i have some experience in remote api’s  i’d like to add that to the discogs wrapper  first rule of all  a remote api call can always fail  so we need to define  how the discogs api fails  either by being loud with exceptions  or by being silent with just returning nil in the case of a failed request  actually in ruby we don’t use exceptions that much  maybe we should make that a parameter when creating the api like  discogs new exceptions true  i believe your wrapper is for two very different kinds of usage  either for extremly easy usage  where nil would be ok  or for integrating in a system like us  where every failure should be reported most precisely  so that we can track the cause of it easily  sounds like you could accept me  adding to your stuff  just found this on youtube  bad sellers at discogs http   www youtube com watch v xwutk7hgqto  eike am 20 06 2014 um 01 06 schrieb andrew buntine notifications github com

the use case i'm planning for right now is in the realm of iot  we have lots of end devices each with an open socket for sending requests  getting responses  and getting async alerts  then  we have a separate socket  for each device  that goes "up"  on which we send and receive parsed events to the rest of the system  i would like to have a single copas thread for each device that is able to block waiting for async events coming from both directions  acting as a sort of translation proxy  i know i could currently accomplish this with two threads  one for "up" and one for "down"  but that runs into issues when devices expect both request response   async events on the same socket  it would be much cleaner to have both sockets handled from the same thread  processing whichever is ready first that would allow me to keep both data and logic locally in the thread  simplifying things greatly  it would also be possible to go hard the other way and introduce more threads   some sort of message passing system  basically pseudo sockets  that would allow me to build a actor system  this would also require changes to copas to allow the use of pseudo sockets and i felt that this was much less in line with the spirit of coaps than implementing another call that already exists in luasocket

hey ryan   i took a break  i have investigated vlad fairly well  at one point i believed it was the way in which git was un taring files  but that did not appear to be the problem  i did find that vlad will create symlinks before the repo is checked out  this was observed by running "watch 'ps  ef   grep git'" on each server  vlad would kick off a git clone  and move over to symlinking  however  git clone was still executing on the remote server  i need to look into this more  i wanted to see if the upgrade to 1 x version of open4 might have triggered this  and i know it's a long shot  oddly things work fine when deploying to a single server  something must be tainted when running more than one     thanks for the follow up

sorry  i don't know how to use pull request 
sorry i missed this  smile  i'm not a lawyer so definitely can't give you advice but i personally release all of my stuff under  mit  http   choosealicense com licenses mit   because it's simple and permissive which is what i want  i know some people prefer  apache 2 0  http   choosealicense com licenses apache 2 0   because of the way it deals with patents  in short  i think either would be great  thanks for the response 
are you saying that a distro that installs    a  files without probably intending to is working in a well behaved way 
hey nick  this happens for any section i try and view unfortunately  even ones without any of the members fields 
at the moment all i need is simple access to all entries in three different sections  output as an array  the custom script  e g  a symphony event  should then create some special sql queries to push the content  i e  entries  to a different  email server  database  i like the idea of using a database wrapper  because there willl be more occasions in this project to use it instead of writing a lot of code manually each time  so probably the best solution is symquery 
i haven't looked  but i'm happy to do so  if you don't feel i'm barking up the wrong tree here in terms of the idea 
hello mosabua  thanks for taking a look  followed the instructions at https   books sonatype com nexus book reference npm proxying registries html parts 17 2 to 17 4  our first attempt did fail due to a folder permission problem  user running nexus couldn't create the backups folder   once we fixed that we could create the proxy  hosted and group repositories  but when attempting to use npm with our group repo   something like  npm install grunt cli     we would get the no registered handler error  maybe the permissions issue left nexus in an unstable state until reboot  other existing repositories were operating normally 
i'll get back to you in late january when i'm back to work 
yes  to authors or  preferably  to the specific files covered under the gfdl  in a manner similar to what follows  copyright © year your name  permission is granted to copy  distribute and or modify this document under the terms of the gnu free documentation license  version 1 1 or any later version published by the free software foundation  with no invariant sections  no front cover texts  and no back cover texts   replacing your name with the documents' primary copyright holder   from what i can tell  that would be victor mierla

yep  i checked  you need to push a  release   tag  representing a  semantic version  https   getcomposer org doc articles versions md   f e   1 0 0  or similar  and have the packagist service for your github repo installed  it can be found under settings  integration and services  then a new release version is hooked over to packagist so we do not need to install the version  dev master  and you could easily tag new releases allowing dependants to update while keeping their applications stable and compatible

i've done nothing but what the readme rdoc file says  note that i have not installed a mailer software like postfix nor sendmail on my system  so maybe that's why the application is crashing

hi  ralphm    i'm using 2 1 5  which comes with debian squeeze   the ticket you mention points to this one  https   support process one net browse ejab 1006  where the user badlop reports an issue that looks basically the same  that ticket is filed against an older version and they rejected it  o  i've implemented a crude workaround for now and will sometime check against a newer version of ejabberd  i'm not sure whether anything should be done about this in wokkel  so i guess you can close this ticket for now  thanks

hi  no problem at all  will retest in a bit  will give it some time to index 
thanks  i did the change and it now works  i would like to point out that the project readme txt file was a bit confusing in this regard  and i should have checked the code instead   would it be ok the update the readme txt file to correct this misunderstanding and include a small usage example

thank you  i wrote a bit about the project  on my blog  http   jessebuesking com articles programming c ruby 2017 02 13 omnomnum#benefits of the new approach   where i explain why i chose c  one other reason that i failed to mention on the blog post is that by using c we can manage memory ourselves  relieving gc pressure in rubyland  i have a coworker who develops on windows  and i have yet to hear any issues  i'll chat with him today and let you know if there are any problems running on windows  currently it only supports english  but there's nothing preventing us from adding other languages  i'm not sure what the cleanest way to support other languages would be that would make the process "easy"  so suggestions are welcome

heya  ok  wait   i think i had my ns records incorrect  before  as per my earlier comment  i had an a record for ns t mydomain com pointing to the server  then i had an ns record  delegating queries for t mydomain com to ns t mydomain com  however  i'm not sure if that will work  since ns t mydomain com is under t mydomain com  and it would cause some weird recursive lookup  i've changed the records  so that the server running sods is ns mydomain com and i've delegated queries for t mydomain com to ns mydomain com  is that now correct  on the server i run   what does the host name lookup failure here mean  have i still got something funky in my setup  cheers  victor

thanks for the feedback  rldhont how do i do that  i'm using epsg 3857 in the project  should i define this elsewhere in the qgis server options  no  no restrictions defined  the project is configured with all default options  afterwards and went back and checked the layers in the wmts section  to see if it was necessary to have layers on the wmts getcapabilities output 
yes  elpaso it looks like similar issue

no  i've not been able to make that work the way i'm looking to  it is entirely possible that i'm just not implementing it correctly on my end  however  i have indeed  and i've had this discussion a few times with nyall already  in summary    i'm acting as an independent end user qgis fan    i lack the personal resources to fund the project more than small  sub  100usd  donations sporadically    i lack any real appreciable programming skill  look at my github commit history if you want a laugh    i do have access to some larger gis organizations and people in my network  which i do evangelize qgis and related osgeo projects to    i lack the personal capital at my employment to have gotten them to invest fund qgis development  despite my consistent and hard pushes to move us away from arc    when i can secure funding  i will 100  do so  until then  i'm just a low resource end user  unless something like this is bite sized enough for me to fund  or someone is flexible enough to setup a lot of small "gates" that i can fund as my budget allows

yes  the file is malfomed  nope  the layer is shown as normal attribute table layer  it's just empty  as i wrote  gdal seems to emit an  error  but qgis considers it just a  warning   that seems to be the only issue    
 gioman hi thanks for your reply i have put up a screen dump for you of this happening  if you press lt tab all is ok  it only happens when you click qgis at bottom of screen again on task bar opening more than one instance 
i've tested on 3 8  3 4 and 2 18
hi  gioman what type is the datasource  shapefiles and oracle bd have you checked if you have write permissions in the folder where the data source is  yes  i have  have yo checked if you have write permissions in the table layer case is in a db  i e  postgis   yes  i have  do you make use of any widget custom form  if yes  have you tried if the same happen without them  no  nothing custom or widget  note that nowhere in the software is the local date system format being assumed  is this the correct behavior  shouldn't qgis use the host system format as its own

i tried to prepare the project above  screenshot  to share it   but surprisingly  now  reducing opacity works perfect  i know i had this problem before  thus it must be somehow reproducable  but only under certain conditions  don't know yet what causes this problem   will come back when i find out more

 nyalldawson thanks for the update  i had have success with this tool in older versions  i'll double check as i very well may be doing something incorrectly  in 3 8 i have been setting the 'mode' to only use a single value  however when i do this  the tool complains that i haven't set operators for the range and table options  if i choose operators for them and then run the tool  it throws the index out of range error  i have also gotten this same error  in 3 8  if i set the 'mode' to table and put in one reclass entry for it to use  an example of a table entry would be to reclass the range between 237 and 238 to 239  as a side note  i prefer this tool because of the bottom option to 'replace nodata' values  sometimes i don't even need to reclass a raster  but i want to change the nodata values into 0's  i've found this tool to be the easiest way to do this  and i have gotten it to work in older q versions  this is a separate thing but it would be great to have another tool that only does this operation in isolation

that is a reasonable and meaningful question but the answer is unfortunately "no"  i thought about such a function to create by using the  diff  command one or multiple patch files but the risk is too high that something is wrongly done  maybe an option to let users  experts  select single spelling errors via a web form for creating one or multiple patch files would be acceptable so that they could use it for a pr  but that isn't trivial and not yet available  by the way the used program  codespell  https   github com codespell project codespell  has such a   not yet tried by me   function  see for e g  the options    write changes   and    interactive

it affects vector line  and polygon layers the layer source is from a postgres database  i know i have not had issues in the past with prior releases 
the topology checker does not report any invalid geometry  anything else i could check    edit  clarification  the file i uploaded had overlapping polys  as a result of the bug i describe  however  removing the offending polys does not change the behaviour described 
first  sorry  i did search for this bug but nothing came up  second  seriously  sorry  but this seems like a bit of ui and ux fail  the pane has no indication it is collapsed and no indication it can be expanded  any chance of a fix 
yes 3 10 2 but it started in 3 10 1 so its the same problem
sadly  i cannot share it because it's for a paper that will be published 
 alexbruy when setting an input as optional and then running processing tools if no input is set  the processing tools throw back errors  the execution of the model will then be cancelled  e g  if you run "refactor fields"  and its input layer is optional with no input layer set  you will get an error and the execution of the entire model will be cancelled 
it's a request to bring it back  the feature is gone 
i guess it has not – i can't find anywhere to connect an atlas to a 3d view  for example  for automating the camera position  i e  the camera parameters inside print composer  centers xyz  distance  pitch  heading  could be read from a table according to the currently active atlas item   but i think you are right and this should be understood more as a "feature request" than a "bug"    gioman

yeah  but if sync_all   just pulled down some new grains  then the grains should be reloaded  i bring it up because this happened to me  and i had to run state highstate twice any time i messed with a custom grain   i imagine this is the case for any of the extensions that don't get reloaded during module_refresh    in my case it was custom grains  so  either module_refresh should expand its role  or load_dynamic   should call an additional function that also reloads the extensions not caught by module_refresh

 ch3ll so in an sls file it is possible to define a pillar like this   which is dict where the value at  parent1  is a list of k v pairs  however  because of how the consul external pillar module uses the key value store hierarchy to represent different data structures  it appears that the above data structure is impossible to achieve using the consul external pillar  thus rendering it unsuitable for a number of valid use cases  the reason for this is that dictionaries are represented by sub keys in the key value store  in a tree like structure and list items are represented as newlines in the value of a key  however  since you cannot define a dict within the value of a key  it is impossible to have a list of key value pairs  which is the format used by a large number of salt formulas and states

sorry  i should have been more clear  i have a conf file that's setup as a jinja template with   grains 'host'    declarations throughout  when i used cp get_file to push this file out to my minions i thought that it would replace the grains declarations with their appropriate variables  this was not the case  it just copied the template verbatim

thanks thomas  this is exactly what i was looking for  this is a big help   utahdave i'll look at this a bit more but i'm not sure if this is all that feasible with sun packaging  few reasons  i'm not sure if you can see what version a uninstalled package is  i'll look into that more though  the other reason is that the versioning scheme is horrendous  for example  here is what versions of solaris packages look like   'ppt05 pvt hawaii edu'   'cswbash'  '4 2 37 rev 2012 08 24'  'cswbdb47'  '4 7 25 rev 2009 10 18_rev p4'  'cswbdb48'  '4 8 30 rev 2010 12 06_rev p0'  'cswcacertificates'  '20120511 rev 2012 05 11'  'cswcas cpsampleconf'  '1 42 rev 2010 11 26'  'cswcas cptemplates'  '1 45 rev 2011 08 28'  'cswcas crontab'  '1 48 rev 2012 09 02'  'cswcas etcservices'  '1 42 rev 2011 02 16'  'cswcas etcshells'  '1 45 rev 2011 07 12'  'cswcas inetd'  '1 42 rev 2010 11 26'  'cswcas initsmf'  '1 44 rev 2011 04 21'  i briefly looked at how puppet's sun package provider handles this and they also don't look like they handle versions  on "update" it seems they just blindly uninstall and reinstall     i've got to look at this a bit more though  if you have any ideas i'm open though    thanks
they look like the default plus a grains conf in minion d

yes  and this is the reason why the minion id changes  but on debian the  etc hostname does not include the domainname  before https   github com saltstack salt pull 6734 the next rule would match  fqdn   socket getfqdn     and then the fullname including the domain part is used

that was a 64bit box  was going to try 32bit but the install was amd64   didn't see if it would install  just assumed it wouldn't  a 32 bit install for xp would be very useful for me at least  can probably do some testing on 32bit either this week or next if needed 
hey tom  no worries  yes  these are active directory users  i just checked  and they don't show up in the output of "getent passwd"
it was discussed here  https   groups google com d topic salt users ce jo0bm hw discussion i'm trying to deploy out many different projects via salt without having to grant ssh access on the minion to the upstream git repo  the collisions in tag names is really the only problem
it never releases unless i hit ctrl c to kill it  all of the minions that are in queried group when it hangs have accepted keys

i do have a master and a minion on the same machine  but that's not the one i was seeing the error with  i thought a highstate had upgraded that minion to 0 16 4  but it seems i am mistaken    sorry for the noise 
should have said that  2014 1 10  the worst part is that salt master keeps running so the "is the salt master running " error seems completely spurious 
yes i mean the �  i'm ok with the fact that some commands might cause an error on the minion  i just expect the encoding to be right 
 techhat i hadn't thought of it that way  i don't often use the command without a map  only thing i'm curious about is the follow use case     i have two backends  let's say amazon for my production  and lxc for my dev on my laptop   i have machine web example org on amazon which is not connected to my developement salt master   i have a provider configured for amazon so salt cloud sees web example org when it queries   i've created web example org using salt cloud and a map which indicates the provider to use is lxc am i sure that it's not going to delete web example org from amazon if i just use  salt cloud   destroy web exemple org  without a map   in this case using   m my_lxc_map  gives some information about which provider to query  doesn't it

well i am not sure exactly what the best solution would be but i would say that it do not conform with error handling in the cli right now  look at this example   if i from the cli target a minion that do not exists i get back a empty response and that error on stdout that no minions matched the target  but when i look at the exit codes i still get 2 from the call that seemed to be ok  if we translate this to how it works now in the api when my target matches no minions i get back ok and 200 code that would be like getting back 0 status code on the cli  i have also looked at if a http error code would be good for this but i do not think so because i can't find any that makes sense in this case  but it might be good enough at the same time as is and i would have to assume that if the return block is empty then no targets was matched even if that is a big assumption on what the problem really is 
yes  it would report cleanly a second time if there's no issue 
 cvrebert if you want to specify multiple environment variables  why not put them into separated lines  
 rallytime it's a bit tricky for me to confirm as it was a long time ago i had a dev environment setup and i'm currently swamped with other work  could you reproduce my issue with the 2014 1 0 git tag

unfortunately i don't have debug logs for the above error  i've since launched about 10 more instances using the same ami in the same way and not experienced the issue again  so i don't think such logs are going to be easy to obtain  i agree that it probably just needs some exception handling  and ideally a couple of automatic retries before a hard failure 
are you asking me to restart the master or the minion  i've already tried restarting the minion  without any change  there are several other new minions  in the past 18 hours  which are able to connect to the master 
i had included the output of lspci for the video card on my original post using the command that the salt grains use for parsing  lspci  vmm   lspci grep  i vga shows 
i think  changes  is at least as good as the  mixed  name  if not slightly more explicit 
hrmm  looks to be my mistake misreading a log file  of course  doing it again just upgraded all my salt minions       
yes   a matches   only   the beginning of the string   z matches   only   the end  i think using them together matches nothing  in any case avoiding   and   doesn't really solve anything          +   etc    are still special characters  e g       import re       re match  r' a foo '  'foo'     _sre sre_match object at 0x022aefa0   i think the issue is not the regex  it's the fact that the same string is being used for a string    match  a file glob  and a regex  the syntaxes are not compatible  i think the type of each matcher needs to specified in the conf file 
i putting my schedule config in the minion config it's work  version 0 16 0
ah  i see the difference  yes  it actually is a non blocking call and the docs are wrong  the key difference there is the  if not fn_ret  line  cmd_iter will continue looping around that for until it either gets a return on get_iter_returns throws an exception  regardless of what timeout you give it  i haven't actually had much need to use either yet  though i suspect the cmd_iter_no_block is closer to what i'd need 
yes  this is merely a feature request in fact  also  the documentation mentions nested grains and doesn't give clear examples on how to manipulate these     thatch45 yes  this would be to use with g

 jfindlay the docs for vmware are showing 2015 5 4  might be good to update that as well  i'm fine with keeping the legacy stuff in  but we should try to duplicate the getting started content i think 
works for me  i think there's still a chance people will miss it  but overall this is an improvement  i'm going to close this 
that sounds reasonable  but i stuck with my workaround of setting the path in the cron command  i will use that method in the future 
unfortunately that did not help
no i have not  i also can't see any other special services running  and i tried running salt minion on "safe mode with network" with the same result 
for example  salt ' ' state highstate  b3 but it happens with other  b values and single states as well  state sls   didn't remember if it also happened with cmd run or other commands  when some minions fail then they fail most of the time when you run the state again  but the minions not matching will differ from time to time  so i don't think it's a problem with those minions but with the master 
should fix it completely for any instances where salt generates the 'dest' file  not sure about modules cp get_template forcing makedirs   false  that feels like it should be a parm passed by the caller  but i guess thats more of a policy thing 
yes  it did has many zombie process of salt master i do not know why i redeploy the salt master it now work fine on thu  mar 6  2014 at 4 27 am  colton myers notifications github comwrote 
i am running ubuntu 12 04 2 lts
before doing anything  i'd be inclined to get advice on the use of autodoc  at the moment  the docs are  seemingly  duplicated  but slightly different  between those two files for the other existing filters so it seems like an opportunity to solve 2 issues at once  otherwise  if there's a reason for both areas and autodoc is off the table  i can do a pr 
  the problem with  cp list_states   it lists all states  not only those assigned to the specific minion    the problem with  cp list_master   it lists just every file provided by the fileserver but then again  it would probably make the most sense to add a param like  assigned true  to  cp list_states  which returns only those states actually assigned to this minion 
yes  i did experiment with  env_order   but as this _shouldn't_ be relevant here and also didn't have any visible effect  i didn't mention it explicitely  my  master d fileserver conf

 carlpett right now  all runners which execute on the master have the  __salt__  dunder available to them and this dunder is populated with the other runners so that functions from one runner can be cross called by another  so if you need that functionality rght now  it's already there for you  the idea here is simply to do some housekeeping by renaming that dunder to  __runner_  and then bring in execution modules as  __salt__

indeed  running with trace shows the private key but how would i actually save it in a file 
 rallytime i'll give you an example 
the same engine that salt supports  jinja and mako  thr first one must be there i think because is the salt default  and the other one is already working on salt cloud  el 11 11 2013 19 50  "colton myers" notifications github com escribió 
here is   i enabled debugging and nothing is logging  it doesn't try anything with the script  i haven't debug the code yet 
###### master version report 
unfortunately  i can not switch to the developer branch  as this is a real productive cluster that servers hundreds of pppoe customers  what i want to achieve is to get all state highstate data written to a mysql server  so i have created the db and added the sql stuff found in the docs  afterwords i installed python mysqldb on all minions and on the master  i added the mysql config options as seen in this report  when i watch the logs and look at the clock  it is a minute interval   also using tcpdump  nothing happens  the minions do not connect to mysql  no connection on port 3306 to the specified host  also nothing in the logs  even if i turn on debug mode  i can not see anything concerning mysql  but when i go to the master and add the   return argument to salt  data gets written  so am i missing something  i had asked for help on the mailing list and they told me to open a bug report  as they could not see any misconfiguration 
master 17 1 and minion 17 2
hi  i installed it using the develop branch of salt bootstrap  used the defaults  no extra switches or arguments  on mint 16 it installs the ubuntu saucy deb package through apt  and on 14 the quantal package

unfortunately i could not find any error messages per se  since the minion never returns  but the output of "salt call  l debug state highstate"  which works  is available at https   gist github com jakwas 8450721
it is happening multiple times but it has yet to repeat itself on the same minion  and it seems to happen very much at random 
 whiteinge you can disregard  it was improper handling on my part with the python salt event library 
i created   etc salt  und start the minion as root with the full path  that works  i have not created any configuration  it found my master   how to get a clean and working installation on os x  would be great if the bootstrap script works with os x  10 6 8   https   github com saltstack salt bootstrap pull 102
sorry  somehow skipped my mind  here you are 
was working with the head of 2015 8 branch using salt ssh   not 2015 8 3 because there's a bug we're working around that's fixed on head   that said  from code inspection  it looks like it affects it even in 2015 8 3 
i thought that may be the case  i will close this up  right now 2014 7 0 works with or without tar_options being supplied  things do break if only  v  is supplied to tar_options    which is what i was previously doing to ensure that 2014 1 13 worked  though that now seems to be tar itself complaining about invalid options supplied  i think the confusion is just caused by my use of the english language  p
 jfindlay added a little extra to the original comment 
currently you'll have to redirect them to use the template until github realizes this is a great idea and they implement it themselves  however  if someone doesn't use the template  and some projects have bot accounts that can do this for them  you can simply say  hey  i noticed you didn't use our template  please go here to update your issue using the template  http   issuetemplate com saltstack salt   template name     issue number   and their issue content will be loaded into the "other comments" and they can move stuff into the right fields  then they just click update and it will update the original issue using the template you built  then  if you had a bot  it can assign the issue and label it automatically based on comments you have in the template or something 
no  i'm looking for a minion to minion copy   my actual use case is where a build takes place  then the executables are distributed to a couple of different places on disk    also  is it just me  or are "file recurse" and "file copy" not very "stateful" names  and couldn't they both just be subsumed into "file managed"  ie  make sure this file directory is an accurate copy of whatever file directory  wherever it came from  
yes  only minion hangs  it is suse with customized kernel 
i agree that i could open up permissions  but that seems to ignore  at least in my mind  the main purpose of being able to set  root_dir   i don't need to run as a non root user  although i prefer it for various reason  one being that i have multiple salt environments that i am currently working with  thus  i want to have everything related to each environment contained within it's own set of directories  running salt master as non root has  so far  worked just fine using the same  saltfile  + config file approach 
 basepi yeah  sorry about     in the title    32  might be redundant  but i'd like to be able to target a single host ip address for testing purposes  i also don't really see a reason why   32  should not be supported  i was trying out the scan roster and quite surprised that it didn't work when i tested it against a single host  didn't necessarily want to affect multiple boxes in unforeseen ways  
i deleted  home jason  ssh completely   note the ssh_home_t instead of user_home_t

i've tested in environments with  10  10 20 and 150  it seems to happen across all of those environments since the upgrade to 2013 1 0 1  it always seems to be the same minions not returning the info but the minion logs look correct and a salt minion restart has no effect  just tried pkg verify instead of version and the same nodes that fail with pkg version throw an error with this command  the minion function caused an exception  traceback  most recent call last   file " usr lib python2 6 site packages salt minion py"  line 767  in _thread_return return_data   func _args   _kwargs  file " usr lib python2 6 site packages salt modules yumpkg py"  line 832  in verify return __salt__ 'lowpkg verify'   names  keyerror  'lowpkg verify'
our master using 2014 1 7 in one site and 2014 1 10 in another  minions are a mix of 2014 1 7 and 2014 1 10 depending on the progress of a current patching change   we only use saltstack as a c c platform at present so only use built in modules + a few custom ones  not sure if that helps  versions in our main site  salt  2014 1 7 python  2 6 6  r266 84292  nov 21 2013  10 50 32  jinja2  2 2 1 m2crypto  0 20 2 msgpack python  0 1 13 msgpack pure  not installed pycrypto  2 0 1 pyyaml  3 10 pyzmq  2 2 0 1 zmq  3 2 4
thanks for taking a look  rallytime  to further expand  it doesn't appear to be the same master each time  the problems also exhibited its self with the minions installed on the respective master    the minion for master1 appears in the  salt run manage down  output on master    on master2 the master2 minion shows itself as down that master  the minion is however up on the masters counter part  with the remote minion we upgraded  standard vm  no master  commands work on master1 and not master2  appearing in the  salt run manage down  output for the master we have issues with  when running that command  i see the minion respond to it and it seems to think it's returned and all is okay  i did wonder if the return was somehow ending up at the wrong master but not sure how i could possibly tell  we've tried restarts  full os  of the master that's not working and we've tried restarting the salt minion process on our remote node but the behaviour persists 
hi  cachedout   it did  it seems that when i tried one job such as  salt ' ' test ping   it will produce more than one defunct minion with each container 
i changed by minion_id file and rm the pki keys  then restart the service  i'm sure that this issue can be easily reproduced 
sure these could be options for me  however i thinking more of somehow limiting the minion itself rather than depending on other frameworks  this is especially important for systems where selinux or apparmor is not available  this sort of leads me on to another question  are there plans to build a more self contained single file minion  maybe built with the golang or c  that can include all of the dependancies in a single package without depending on python  i see this as important for more traditional unix platforms such as solaris  hpux  aix etc where python may not be available  i'm guessing this could then be used to provide functionality similar to ansible's fireball mode

how do i do that 
 rallytime i'm using debian packages + digital_ocean_v2 py from master branch  i did the modifications for it to work with multiple pages  yet it escapes my knowledge on how to 'failsafe' it cheers
got it  i was confused by the two date based version systems  thanks
both server and client
root_alias  alias present    name  root   target  "user+example example gmail com" just thought that it could be the part after + that interferes with the regexp 
fqdn_rand is deterministic random  besically it is mostly the same  but is more flexible comparing to states cron#random  this is how i used it in puppet   besides that states cron#random does not modify file if it is already present which limits it's use  what if one would like to regenerate these randoms 
this one seems to be good  thank you
thanks for looking into this   in this case it's about timeouts  but still  there is no error warning message at all  overall i'd say salt should always report something after each run  unless it was instructed with some 'quite' option  so that user has some idea about what is happening 
yes  something like that  the very best would be if state selection would have the very same capabilities like minion targeting like using grains  pillars  tags  globbing etc  the mechanism for that is already available  i think 
 xenophonf sounds good  thanks    
in this case i have a password specified in a roster file

that page covers the communication at a high level  but doesn't include things like key strength  the mechanics of the rsa key vs the aes rotating key  the negotiation process between the master minion  and a host of other things  i'm looking for something more technical that would be useful to a security team in understanding the deep detail of these things 
it works fine with latest 2014 7 5 the idea behind this bug report ist that the "stable" debian repository package is outdated  https   packages debian org jessie salt minion  package  salt minion  2014 1 13+ds 3   so http   bootstrap saltstack com script should add the salt repo even within debian jessie 
thats the way i do it for longer times     but 1  it seems that people implement it different  already saw that people checkout files "1st run state done" to  tmp because they didn't aware that tje tmp folders are regulary swept by crons   while booting up  2  the stop start of an instance  e g  in aws  is not effected in this solution  example  i have set the grain  foo  true  but the instance was e g  one week down and suffers for git checkouts  security updates and so on     so this grain state is for the birds    thats why i opened this feature request  perhaps you   other find it also useful 
i have the problem on other instances  too   i added temporary the needed data by copying it from provider to profile file  with    salt 2016 x this setup was working fine  actual setup is "default" installed by salt except the cherrypy version which needs to be the wheezy package to get ssl tls activated for salt api  but this shouldn't be used for salt cloud 
will check again tomorrow when i'm work but i had the debug log open  but since that shows a lot i could have missed something  can you advice a log level to set  
after reading my first post again perhaps i wasn't very clear that's what you get for addressing issues when it's late   i found the following about git and symlinks  git just stores the contents of the link  i e  the path of the file system object that it links to  in a 'blob' just like it would for a normal file  it then stores the name  mode and type  including the fact that it is a symlink  in the tree object that represents its containing directory  when you checkout a tree containing the link  it restores the object as a symlink regardless of whether the target file system object exists or not  if you delete the file that the symlink references it doesn't affect the git controlled symlink in any way  you will have a dangling reference  it is up to the user to either remove or change the link to point to something valid if needed  what i want salt with gitfs to do is see the difference between a normal file and a symlink in git  so if you control a symlink with git i want salt to create a symlink and not a normal file with text 
minion started with init script   usr local etc rc d salt_minion  
when i was running this on friday i was using 2014 1 10  to clarify my particular issue  my host filesystem has some files set to uid gid of 503 20  i mount these as a shared folder using vagrant and they get mounted using nfs to my guest  when the salt provisioner runs on my guest and creates the symlink it does so successfully but cannot change ownership to root root  all files on the mount are basically forced to use the uid gid of the mount  503 20 in my case   everything would be fine if i could let it just take the ownership forced upon the symlink when it's created 
2014 1 10       original message      
it only triggers if  makedirs  true   it seems  22959 sls 
i observe in  process explorer  http   technet microsoft com en us sysinternals bb896653 aspx   search before and after for "salt minion"  that  salt ' ' test ping  adds either 10 or 12 salt minion threads   akurdyukov  can you observe that too  i have now 734 salt minion threads  and consider this a thread leak   this is a case of debugging  not logging  if you asked me 
 twangboy i agree with  lorengordon  this leads into the direction of a parser for the config file  and a rather smart one  while this is doable in the  upcoming  msi installer https   github com saltstack salt windows msi  this would be a nightmare in nsis   for curiosity  how do the unix installers parse the config file on an upgrade   i would like to propose to discuss to reduce  salt conf minion  to the absolute  bare minimum  this maybe just  master  and  id   minion name   all other configuration  i argue  should be grains  including root_dir  this way  the master could 'upgrade' any new settings  there would be no in place comments  but i don't see this as a disadvantage  as configuration must be documented centrally anyhow  i have the gut feeling that minion configuration outside of grains is like 'reinventing the wheel'  also  salt should have the ability to configure itself 
 waynew   the more modern salt versions with python 3 have a much worser performance  i hope this issue helps to depict the importance for an effort to understand the underlying issues 
thanks  basepi for clearing up the confusion 
it is working now  thanks
fix confirmed  well done 
i just do something like this  i also put salt master in debug mode   but no info report when i execute "salt key" command 
that is an extremely brief explanation  1  there should be a link to the  presence events  doc in the  runners manage  documentation  2  my interpretation of the documentation leads me to believe that  runners manage alived  will return only minions that are not in the  lost  state  is this correct  3  with default settings   presence_events  false   what is expected from  runners managed alived  
to be honest  the error under mavericks isn't what concerns me  mavericks still works  user list_groups not available on yosemite is what concerns me  unless you're saying you think zeromq is responsible for the error on yosemite  anytime we use  cmd run  with    user  we'll get this as the keyerror 
it's working again  thank you 
sorry  this is not about return code  shouldn't cp is_cached return a boolean of true or false  
network default_route is interesting    thanks  i'll see what i can do with it  and yeah  i really  really  really don't like this feature of systemd  but i'm concerned that it's just the way of the future  so i'm going along with it   as for how they're determined  as you say you may be able figure it out if you know the order in which the hardware is attached  but most of my work is remote hands  even in person  i don't know if the physical slot order will always match the order exposed to the software  i think it'd be an interesting challenge to give someone  "here's a computer with built in nics  tell me exactly what the network interface names will be after this raid adapter is installed " 
 dmitrykuzmenko unfortunately yours patch is not working   
 jfindlay archived file sounds like a great solution  but i believe not currently available with windows minions #12992
i want to use ext_pillar from svn  my subverion works perfect  i just not do understan where the "braches" folder comes from 
just replaced the cfdisk command with  sfdisk  d  another alternative is to use  parted  but that may not be available everywhere either 
 jfindlay  no it doesn't stop genrepo  but we have not had jinja2 templating so this code has not been tried to be run for months  and now that we have jinja2 templating the old jinja2 code may need a spruce up to actually start working   if it is indeed still needed  this is on 2015 8 0
sure  sorry i didn't notice that one first 
the test repo has the commit hash in the requirements txt  here is what i get for the    versions report 
well  i did make a small mistake  minion shows an error but reports true also  master 
i was gonna reply  but of course i checked that      maybe not    my shell had it builtin  but actual external   bin which does not exist indeed    "yum install which" fixed this 
actually the same master   just a different address to access the master based on which network the minion is connected to  when the minion is on the same network as the master  the minion needs to connect to the master via it's local hostname  when the minion is connected externally  it needs to connect using a public url  there are possibly some work arounds for my particular case   but i don't think the intent is to have the minion die when a dns lookup fails for a given master  there are many reasons a particular dns may fail to resolve  even temporarily  but an alternate master may still be available and therefore the minion daemon should continue to load and run  i have set my minion conf file as such  master    saltmaster   master wolfpackmars2 com this works great for minions on my local network who can resolve saltmaster using the local dns server  the problem is  my remote minions that aren't connected locally fail to connect at all because they are having trouble resolving the host saltmaster  i've considered having separate config files for local minions and non local minions   but in the case of a minion that is occasionally not local this could create problems 
sure thing  this is occurring on two debian wheezy hosts  both show exactly the same output 
sorry  missed that part  i see 4 errors in my master's log file  2015 11 18 17 51 36 153  salt master   warning   1165  authentication failure of type "user" occurred  2015 11 18 17 51 36 445  salt master   warning   1176  authentication failure of type "user" occurred  2015 11 18 17 52 06 920  salt master   warning   1177  authentication failure of type "user" occurred  2015 11 18 23 48 59 976  salt master   warning   1166  authentication failure of type "user" occurred  in terms of how to reproduce or what i was doing  i had installed a new minion which was not showing up on the master so i was going through the log files to figure out what was happening  i reported that issue in #29032   that's about it  for reproducing the issue  i guess you can install an ubuntu based salt minion in aws with the ami id of ubuntu trusty 14 04 amd64 server 20141125  ami 978dd9a7   and then run apt get update  followed by installing salt minion  you should then see this error on the master  hope that helps  i can run some more debug output if that helps  thanks    
 basepi fyi   roughly from the top of my head  i can provide more precise timings if you want    from start   salt cloud  p profile oneminion   to trace is  1min   from sending the  created instance  event to trace is  10sec  between these three is  1sec
np  tnx for the quick resolution   
even with the new version  updated today  i see the same issue 
yep 
pymongo   3 0 introduces some breaking changes but using 'connection' instead of 'mongoclient' has been deprecated since pymongo 2 4 about 3 years back  it would take a really old pymongo for this to be a breaking change for users  up until pymongo 2 8 1 connection was still supported  http   api mongodb org python 2 8 1 api pymongo connection html#module pymongo connection  but it's now totally absent and forcing usage of mongoclient  the more "breaking" change will be the fields list in find_one  in pymongo 2 x this was 'fields' and now is 'projection' and no backwards compatibility is provided  testing on pymongo 2 8 1 the usage of 'projection' in place of 'fields' just leads to it being ignored  the side effect is the whole document gets returned  not just the pillar field specified by the user  this may be enough to place a requirement on pymongo   3 0 though  the merged pull request above allows users with 'fields' in their master config and pymongo 3 x to get the filtered down field list  i left the config as 'fields' in the master config to not break people's master config file  and it just uses projection in the background  a future change to consider will be using 'projection' instead of 'fields' in the master configuration

 techhat  i am not entirely sure  but it may be a matter of changing the url to point towards the tenant api server that gets installed when deploying the azure pack environment  but my knowledge is limited on the differences between microsofts azure cloud and the windows azure pack  i haven't tried changing the urls in the salt source code yet  but if i get a chance to  i will come back with what i find
i discovered the root of the problem  the "    library zip salt fileserver" directory does not have in it all the files that are in the analogous "    python27 lib site packages salt fileserver" directory when salt unity py is run directly  does anyone know how those files could be made to be populated in the library zip based directory 
the latest update of freebsd seems to have fixed the issue for me  apparently the latest commit for py27 requests fixed it  http   www freshports org www py requests  i guess this issue can be closed now 
ok  seems like i had a "  data" line also in  srv pillar top sls  but no  srv pillar data init sls
maybe  twangboy can have a look   i have no problem submitting a pr if he also thinks this is the correct solution 
 akm0d i added both the information you requested in the initial message  feels like you are copy pasting the message instead of reading the ticket 
my minion config is an unmodified copy of the sample config 
tried with 2015 2 today but i still see discrepancies in number of results  on mar 24  2015 6 21 pm  "nicole thomas" notifications github com wrote 
the command is just to put highstate on the single clent this policy is applied to  from master   salt 'clientname' state highstate  version report from master 
 basepi what i meant is that i expected some parameter in the minion config to set the proxy  that may not be a good idea  but i could not find any guidelines as to how to overcome the proxy issue when using pkg  install  i had naively believed that the solution i used in my standard linux env  setting http_proxy in the environment  would work  i think a low hanging fruit solution would be to add a note in the docs for salt states pkg mentioning how to best handle deployments using an http_proxy 
that fixed the problem  thanks for the quick fix

unfortunately  i have no idea 
made a virtualenv   pip install  e     i re created the virtualenv from scratch just now and wiped all  pyc and __pycache__ files just to be sure 
hi  ch3ll thanks for your response  i ended up writing a script outside of salt to do the upgrade that killed the old pids then did the upgrade  was abit more hassle not using salt to do it but atleast we're upgraded  thanks 
 arroyoc sorry  i keep forgetting to append that 
 jfindlay thank you for trying to repro  i just did another repro attempt with an even larger file and it worked fine  100mb in 5 secs   which is acceptable   unfortunately  i think i simplified this test case a bit too much  my real use case is pulling large files out of a gitfs hosted  pygit2 libgit2 backed  formula  i just tried that again and it is still slow  this probably deserves a different ticket #25672
i did some debugging  this occurs when refreshing pillar data on the minion  i'm using  ext_pillar  with  gitfs   and have a post receive hook triggering  saltutil refresh_pillar   when this happens  the minion stops respondig even to  test ping   this is all i see in the debug log   i tried stracing the process  it is stuck in a poll 
so i edited   usr lib python2 7 dist packages salt utils zfs py  then removed   usr lib python2 7 dist packages salt utils zfs pyc  and started the salt master  assuming this works  in lieu of an actual salt dev environment   removing   real_memoize  from above  is_supported  did not work  same formula as above  
 jfindlay sorry for late reply  it happens with 2015 5 0 can't use the helium version since it has a socket handler leak issue which is fixed in 2015 5 0  jacksontj it's not b c of tornado   
 rallytime   testing this now  i will close this issue if the patch proves to work 
 rallytime   i will try  s0undt3ch's patch this morning and let give you feedback

thank you your help but i think you misunderstood my goal  i wanted to check the package is installed or not  i don't want to install it at once just collect the info  yes i would use cmd run 'rpm  qa  grep vim common' but isn't there a salt solution for this  on 29 10 15 14 41  nicole thomas wrote 
 rallytime absolutely and i'll do ya one better  below is the output from our versions report  but we also found fixed the salt winrepo issue and  submitted a pull request  https   github com saltstack salt winrepo pull 214   it turns out the issue was just some yaml syntax mistake in a winrepo entry  nothing specific to our salt setup  as always   really appreciate the quick responses 
well  i guess all is needed is that svn diff should also get trust true then  running  svn   trust server cert   non interactive diff  r head  runs without certificate error  note the    trust server cert  
here is the state

yes the state that is failing is exactly the same as this file    https   github com saltstack formulas salt formula blob master salt master sls
 cedwards the output above was from the minion while in debug mode  here's   versions report for master 
salt version  salt master 2015 5 0  lithium   it is jinja code into config file  i want to run the same config file with different parameters for different group nodes 
i'm installing it using deb repository for trusty  and  apt get install salt    all the steps are done from salt state  i can copy paste it here  but i believe it is not needed as you've already reproduced the issue  we do not use centos or any rpm based systems  i can't comment whether it is working there or not   
forgot the obvius info 
 cachedout not that i'm aware of  when running it manually  if you ctrl c to get out it continues on with the rest of the tests  i don't think it's a broken test  but a hanging process that doesn't get cleaned up  i spoke with  s0undt3ch about it  since similar things have happened before that he fixed 
 jfindlay there's nothing in the minion log because the schedule is configured in the master config  i've changed the log_level to trace but  as you mentioned  that didn't help much  here is the only line that i get regarding the scheduled job

hi  ch3ll   thanks for the feedback  after manually adding that line things are working again  there is something wrong with the os detection  this issue happens on 3 other servers too   i rolled back updated packages  glib2  python2 setuptools  python2 pyparsing  python2 psutil  to see if things recovered  but no show  as damon atkins pointed out  there is an issue on arch notable in the empty   versions output
 mirceaulinic that would work    the nice thing of a config compound matcher is that you get in fact the running value  sometime pillar data is set but not active because a minion config reload is needed for example 
this issue does not occur on redhat 7 with python 2 7
my config as follows   the config file  before and after the changes  https   gist github com silvenga 650012ce00d6cfe56f2a9b9261d2ba5c i'll definitely try upgrading to 2019 2 1 
that is the pr that was being tested already  it works great in linux  it results in windows are above 
i should have explained the example case  i knew i forgot something  my fault  my brain cell decided to go on vacation mid thought  in the example sls_doc would be pointing to the 1 document  which would be the first testing sls  the header document being sls_doc  0  so doc 2 would not be seen by the state system unless you changed the sls_doc manually  or put jinja in to change it based on some other item  also since this would be using yaml the jinja would still be seen before the yaml so the whole thing would still need to render for all of the jinja  which does make it a bit problematic  an idea to expand this would be to allow sls_doc to have a list so you could enumerate through the internal docs
 jfindlay  thanks for your answer  for the time being  we cannot upgrade yet to a later version  i found another way  though  i wrote a web application in python cherrypy running on the salt master which pushes the configs to the specified slave  this way works as you'd push the configs from the salt master itself  and no need for any kind of permissions 
 mgriffin13 thanks for the reply  unfortunately  the suggestion you made is not working   the state gets re applied still  furthermore  by setting  '10 20'  will create a cron entry like    17          script  and not like    17          script 
the salt call grains items command result is too long  i will just paste one part of it    jfindlay i will see how i can upgrade on my server and report the result back
nope  used the package from the official repo  http   repo saltstack com #ubuntu to be precise 
yes  i do  i have to say that i havent looked at how the docs are generated  btw  but i think i know  pr incoming 
per a comment i made on #35874  could we get this fix backported to 2016 11 and likely 2016 3  also  there's another issue that i'll open separately if you have multiple interfaces on v3  they'll keep overwriting themselves  the pr mentioned here fixes the region aspect  but there's still a problem w  the interface  i'll look into the keystone  py and see if it's readily apparent why interface is being overridden by each subsequent call and submit a pr  i should know later today tomorrow if it's going to be a simple fix or not  if not  unless someone else with my knowledge of this module wants to take a swing at it  i'll await the oxygen release and see if that fixes it and in the interim utilize the cmd run unless combination i'm using currently 
i installed a wildcard certificate on my proxmox server  and still wasn't able to get things working when salt cloud was verifying ssl  i'm not sure if that is an issue with my configuration  or something else  in regards to the pull request  i was able to successfully get things working with the changes i made  in the little bit of research i did  it looks like salt cloud never used to verify ssl for proxmox  which is why i never had any problems in the past   but then that was changed with this commit  https   github com saltstack salt commit 860d4b73387497269f30c76ef533acc1ef60d1f1   all i changed in the code was give an option in the proxmox provider file to give the user the choice to verify ssl or not instead of having it hard coded on or off 
as it so happened  i was struggling to reproduce this  then it cropped up again whilst debugging another state  output seen on master 
here it is       in my    gitconfig works 
that helps  thanks 
running
ah  i should have wrote to allow the user to change the default behavior via some sort of config option in the salt master config  i've tried running with  arg 'queue true'  and it returned the following error to me
hi  jfindlay that worked like a charm  thanks for your assistance 
hi  jfindlay on the minion the version is 
 jfindlay thanks 
 jfindlay  i tested it again  ### test command       ### conclusion after job 20160416122725056560  i use the client_acl feature and execute the same command agent   it seem's that master didn't send any messages  like the master is not responding 
sorry for the late reply  currently on develop   it would seem the behaviour was introduced by #25935
the issue pertains to the output  not the actual error reported  the output of state sls should be state output not a data report

it seems that winrepo_dir is not a required setting and defaults  srv salt win repo  if i change file_roots base to  srv salt formulas  it silently breaks winrepo functionality  imo  it would follow rulle of least astonishment to have winrepo default to a location that is relative to file_roots base  and of course require an absolute path if you point it to some other location  if you place it outside of a file_roots path  it should generate some warning  in this same winrepo functionality  i ran across another issue that i will create a separate issue for  mentioning it here as it is related  it seems there is no way to turn off the default repo locations for winrepo_remotes as well  i'm find that if i don't set a remote  i get the saltstack salt winrepo git  i believe this requires me to rename my fork of the repo and still leaves me vulnerable to issues with the public repo  i'll open another issue for this  and of course all of this applies to _ng variants as well 
i'll need to recreate this as i am not confident in the logfile i have in my possession  i'll get back to you on this over coming days as i am traveling for the next few  tks
 jfindlay  actually  contents_pillar  is another issue there  not related to the bug  i'm talking about  sure the state rendering fails if  contents_pillar  is absent  but in this example this state does a job only if pillar data  yumrepos   exist  so  execution of a module doesn't pass to the inside of a loop  where  contents_pillar  is defined  the first state works with or without any content in pillar  it's some kind of state  which are applied to all of my hosts  70+   in case some data is defined at pillar  the state does a job  in other case  it does nothing  and it actually working that way  salt repos custom sls  short version   in that case  the second state  packages init sls  is working good  it's find the require dependence to be resolved   there are also no data at pillar  but i don't think that this is a good solution  i suppose there is some bug in sls rendering subsystem 
 jfindlay see below
 jfindlay see above  i use the 2015 8 release with docker 1 8 1 and docker py 1 4 0
 jfindlay thanks for the prompt triage  output as follows 
 jfindlay   2015 8 1   both master and minion  
so  two thoughts   and not fully formed    1   would it be possible to limit the needs of the salt command to read the master configs    or at least  read all of them     we could limit access to those secrets via normal filesystem permissions  not fantastic  but it's the age old problem of how to securely keep secrets in config scripts  2   was thinking of how we could  internally  integrate salt with something like hashicorp's vault  something along the lines of generating a token that is required for the salt master to start  which it would then use to read config values from the vault  and then revoke it's own token  could then extend the salt command to accept a token that would then be used to access the vault with that user's access  like i said   half baked idea at this point  but it'd be interesting to see something along those lines for holding secure data  sdb seems to be an interesting idea   but as you mentioned  it'd be nice to wrap some type of acl authorization around sdb  it accomplishes the goal of getting the passwords out of the configs  but they're still just as easily accessible via sdb get it would seem 
 gtmanfred   so i don't think extension_modules works like that  what i know   or thought i knew   about the extension_modules and module_dirs configuration options    extension_modules is a parent directory where a master or the minion will read extra modules for use  it's also the directory that a minion will install the modules synced from the master into    module_dirs is a list of directories to read execution modules from  there's also runner_dirs to read runners  util_dirs to read util modules  etc  however  the only place that the master will sync modules to minions is the  fileserver env  _modules or  fileserver env  _grains  etc  that's why you can actually specify extension_modules be a directory outside of salt's fileroots   because it's simply a place where modules are read installed into  in order to sync modules  the directory would have to be something in the fileserver in order for the minion to grab it 
here is the issue for my ipv6 interconnexion problem   https   github com saltstack salt issues 32430
 jfindlay  i use 2015 8 0
docker version 1 9 1  build a34a1d5 docker py  1 6 0
salt 2015 8 1 2437 gb8271c7  beryllium  installed with boostrap url 
 jfindlay  this does appear to be related to #24050 
we can start an email if you'd like   i have a number of issues from random master hangs to log spamming to slowless  all in all salt feels very fragile and temperamental  can honestly say i've never felt terribly confident in it's stability  i went to saltconf hoping for some answers   but didn't get many 
on master  both salt and salt master return version 0 17 5 on minion  salt minion returns version 0 17 5 as well  oh  i'm working with an old version  well now i just feel silly  thank you   edit  for posterity's sake  in case someone stumbles into this with a similar issue  i called  sudo apt get install salt master  and  sudo apt get install salt minion  right after i initialized the instances  this installed version 0 17 5 on the machine  a better way to do this at the moment appears to be installing from the saltstack repository  the process for which is described over here  for ubuntu   https   docs saltstack com en latest topics installation ubuntu html
 lomexian works perfectly  just needed to add  match  compound  there  thanks 
i had added   refresh cache to my script before  but didn't help  the   regen thin isn't in 2016 3 4  but is in 2016 11 0  which is why i had never heard or seen it 
 jfindlay thanks for the reply  the version is  salt version  salt  2015 8 1  we are using the ec2 cloud  not boto_lc 
using reactor on master via api  we are using reactor from here  https   github com saltstack formulas ec2 autoscale reactor
awesome  thanks for doing the work 
 utahdave i see there is an aaaa record for  repo saltstack com   but i cannot resolve that aaaa record  or any other record  for anything under the  saltstack com  domain  because the authoritive nameservers for  saltstack com   namely  dns1 stabletransit com   and  dns2 stabletransit com    do not have ipv6 connectivity or published aaaa records  the ipv6 only environment runs its resolvers also ipv6 only  so the authoritve nameservers  saltstack com  need to be made dual stack as well for optimal ipv6 only experience  would that be possible 
i'm using the default transport  so i guess that's  zeromq   not  zmq  as i said in the summary   it does sound like i'm running into #38367  though i never would have found that myself    thanks  if i'm reading that one right  the fact that  include_localhost true  is in the argument list in the manager runner still  see https   github com saltstack salt blob v2017 7 1 salt runners manage py#l250  suggests that it is almost certainly the same issue 
 ritwikbadola definitely  here's a link to information on contributing  https   docs saltstack com en latest topics development contributing html
yep  i did a deeper dive into it  basic module test works

 thebigbear   jfindlay i am sorry  i mixed two errors  error 1203 as you can see in the log lines i attached to my original post  error 1203 appeared trying to install another product   legato networker   i fixed that error  including a couple of strategicaly place quotes       in the install flags  as to the error tying to install jre8_x86  the error was  the solution in this case was to remove hklm software javasoft registry entry  i am sorry i got confused and could not fixed the errors before opening the bug  none of them was saltstack fault  thank you very much 
this was the state that did it  but i actually can't reproduce this error anymore  after i removed the offending library i tried to get a similarly broken install in a sandbox  but everything i've tried produces a working install  my best guess is that this particular install  on windows  has been upgraded  and upgraded  and somewhere in its history a bad develop link has been put in by an old version of python setuptools  i think this issue should probably be closed  but hopefully it will give a hint to someone else hitting this error in the future

sortof  cpanm  u does uninstalling but only from the "local  lib" directories  apparently as a safeguard against deleting core modules  i've used it and it seems to work for modules i installed with cpanm  unfortunately  it doesn't appear to be available in the default package repos for centos 6 and earlier  i've been installing it by hand using cpan  well  that defeats the purpose  so  maybe cpanm isn't the way to go  there does not appear to be an equivalent to  j  j in centos 6  the best i could get was echo "o conf"   cpan which produces a similar list but with totally different formatting  oh  and it will try to autoconfigure your cpan if you don't already have it configured  on thu  feb 18  2016 at 10 00 am  joseph hall notifications github com wrote 
 whiteinge if i add a new nodegroup in  etc salt master  salt api will not get that change unless restart it  as you know  salt api is a simple wsgi server  the token will lose efficacy after server restarts  so  it is not very convenient for user who visit salt api  the current solution i think is sending a request to salt api and update opts attribute in netapiclient class by reading salt master config file  but i'm afraid  the solution may exists potential risk 
sorry  for taking so long to get back  2015 8 7 work has been hectic  anyway  is there a reason the foreman pillar doesn't use the same file that foreman node utilizes  rather than accessing the api  current method  it would be possible to call https   foreman salt node  minion_id  format yml which presents all the same information as foreman node retrieves  i'm not familiar enough with ruby or foreman code base to fix foreman node  but i did create a couple replacement python scripts for master_tops and ext_pillar  to get everything running the same way using the above url  they won't upload grains  but it provides a workaround in case foreman node breaks  if you want me to submit a merge request for that i can  otherwise the merge request i made a couple days would close this issue

 damon atkins i used python 3 5 3  see the attached versions report  that is shipped with salt 2018 3 4  i need this for state tracking and reporting purposes  what is not shown in the example is a custom event i send when the grain changes  using the  onchanges  requisite   without a grain the event would be sent each time the state is run 
i wonder what might be different in your setup in regard to  psutil   i just tried to reproduce it on a clean vagrant box   bento ubuntu 18 04   and it happens reliably  below is the bootstrap command i used 
 ch3ll thanks for looking at this  i tried it on 7 and 8  but only checked the logs on 8 
 twangboy thanks for clarifying  i presumed the permissions weren't getting set as any user could read the log files and cache content 
i've tried a few ways of working around it and haven't found a good way  i follow your logic  but true might be rebooting the machine or true might not rebooting the machine  so success from the state isn't useful  if you do something based on the success  you might get a reboot in the middle of it   just thinking of the module itself  outside of any states   pre salt salt test system reboot only_on_pending_reboot true salt test  true  pre      you can't tell whether that is rebooting it or not  so currently true doesn't have much value 
 nmadhok here are some debug informations from the build     after the vm is build  we need to connect the nic manually to set up an ip    if we do this manual connect fast enough  salt cloud also can configure the ip    after manually connecting the nic  the ip shows up in web client 
 ch3ll thank you for your reply  in fact  i do not know the exact version of package  openssl   which is one case in my work   otherwise  i could use parameter  version    what i'm quite sure about is that the version of the package should greater than  0 9 8e 39  under  centos 5   so  i turned to parameter  pkgs  which is said that it can limit the lowest versions of packages  am i misunderstanding

windows 7  64 
the minion is installed on windows  so i use the available installer on saltstack website it's a bit annoying for debugging stuffs on windows  but so far  configs are pushed correctly from the master    only minion cli seems to cause issues  one cannot run any command i use windows 7 pro sp1 64  tell me if you need more info
no it does not help at all  there is clearly something broken in the db_refresh command
thank you for your answer  i've investigated this issue a bit more  so it looks like that it will hang on worker_threads +1 call  i've disconnected local minion but it didn't help  the command i was using to test this issue is   tried to run this command with different delays  same result 
its good to hear that  m2crypto  is no longer needed  its kinda a pain to install  in that case the i guess the download should be removed from  setup py  on windows  and maybe just an option to opt out the openssl dlls for windows is needed 
 ch3ll yes there is no implementation for "install" as far as i see the code  this must be a documentation error  the win_certutil py docstring also needs to be corrected 
i found the root cause is that i deployed these vms on google cloud  and i specify a startup script which will run everytime when the vm was restarted  and in that startup script  it will restart salt minion  thus causing salt minion start twice   ch3ll thanks anyway for your time on this   +1 
hi  ch3ll  thanks for looking into this  here's the output from  sudo salt call mine get ' ' test ping  on the minion 
 ch3ll i will test when i get back from vacation next week 
huh  i had always assumed that to use  os path    functions  you had to specifically  import os path   in addition to any  import os  import  i just tested it  and apparently i was incorrect in my assumption  derp  never mind about that  i guess 
 ch3ll thanks for your reply  and i tried '  salt call saltutil sync_grains  ldebug  ls  var cache salt minion extmods grains  ' on the minion  the info is as followed 
 ch3ll you're right  and i don't know how i left that out of the bug report    sorry  🐛 if i refer to a specific state file instead of  test   say  test server   it'll work without issue 
oops  pasted the wrong command  i did run  salt call  c  etc salt    local config get sock_dir  as well  and even  salt call  c  etc salt   local config get sock_dir  too  without the       those gave the result as in the original message   with the trailing  minion the output actaully included  warning  config ' etc salt minion' directory does not exist   
yes  it seems like a duplicate  i'm happy to close the issue 
i am able to verify that this is working in 2016 3 1  thank you 
sorry didn't explain terribly well  on a systemd server it appears  etc sysconfig network is no longer used for setting hostname  therefore i propose that the state module check for the presence of systemd then update the hostname via hostnamectl rather than continue to modify the  etc sysconfig network file which no longer provides that functionality 
  i added a https repo to gitfs_remotes   then i added a 17mb file to that repo     var cache salt master gitfs  has increased by 17mb   then i added a 60kb file to the repo     var cache salt master gitfs  has increased by 64kb so it looks like it does not happen for https git repos 
hey  techhat  thanks for the quick response  i would have appreciated a more prominent warning or deprecation announcement with some time for people to adapt to the changes  i now have to rewrite everything in a short period of time to be able to meet certain deadlines  i might undo the changes on my salt master as a workaround for now  i haven't worked with    select query   but it sounds like it would be a good idea to implement that  is there an example you could give how that fearure is used currently  thanks 
hi  ch3ll  thanks for your response  i am unable to connect the minion to master thru port 4505 4506  have even configured the firewall rules too  still no use  i have created the aws instance with public ip settings and unable to connect it with the master 
sure  i'll have a go at it first thing next week 
 gtmanfred i tried to uninstalling and then reinstalling salt  and it works  thanks a lot 
 ch3ll thanks for quick reply   it was by mistake i have corrected that and now i am getting pillar data  the strange thing is when i run state file getting this error  '  error encountered while render pillar top file    here is sls file  root saltmaster suresh # cat test sls test  cmd run   name  pwd  root saltmaster suresh #  root saltmaster suresh # salt 'minion1' state sls suresh test  error   data passed to highstate outputter is not a valid highstate return   'minion1'   'pillar failed to render with the following messages '  'error encountered while render pillar top file '   error  minions returned with non zero exit code  root saltmaster suresh #
hello  thank you for reply  yes  in my case it refers to states from _base_ and _gui_ environments  i expected only two  base_pkgs and hosts  from _base_ environment to be run  as this is what master_tops specifies  
thank you for your reply  yes i use map jinja filtering the pillar  i wanted to add more overrides appends in different saltenvs i've solved the issue using jinja template inheritance  the fact that _gui_ env contains _base_ as well  for now seems like the most elegant way
figured it out was an issue with run zypper ref  s not copying the repos as expected this caused an error at the docker build step   can close or change this to a request to change the logging to somthing which points more to the issue  only effected the dokerng state
 ch3ll yes  it's fixed in 2016 3 4 thank you

general is a formula with following content general init sls include    global   basically the same thing  i was wondering whether doing it the other way will yield different result  the issue here is if i use glob statement in top sls  highstate will run file ending with  sls in the globed formula  regardless on what's specified in init sls 
closing as it's now implemented  yay 😃
 gtmanfred sadly that doesn't help   
here's the minion config
thanks much for the quick response  it appears that i was on the right track with my assumptions  below are my thoughts as a new contributor to saltstack  imho  with which  2 will get you a coffee   the pchanges enhancement is a great idea that should be advanced more aggressively  my suggestion would be    update documentation to promote storing predictive changes in new updated state modules  it is not clear from the single line mentioning  pchanges  today    also state that wherever possible   changes  should be the actual changes made on the minion  instead of copying  pchanges  and hoping nothing underlying went wrong   recommend copying  pchanges  to  comments  in existing modules utilizing  pchanges  if  result is none  in the interim  as a bridge   revisit existing modules utilizing  pchanges  to enforce above   states file managed   etc    update unit tests to enforce  changes        if  result is none  if  pchanges  is present  in effect grandfathering in state modules that do not utilize it    update highstate outputter to sub  pchanges  for  changes  if  result is none   it appears to be the only one that references  changes  directly    the rest walk recursive dictionaries    update documentation to remove  pchanges  to  comments  recommendation   put pressure on prs for existing modules to meet the new standard from my quick survey  it's really only highstate that directly references calls out  changes  directly  in terms of seeing modules adopt  pchanges   i think the documentation  teaching  enforcement approach makes sense  i've never mananged an open source project thought  so i'm prepared to be told otherwise 
i solved the issue by installing manually  python minimal_2 7 3 0ubuntu2 2_amd64  and  python_2 7 3 0ubuntu2 2_amd64   this version was not present in archive ubuntu com main  there is only  2 7 3 0ubuntu2 0  which should meet the requirements      2 7 3 0ubuntu2    but that didn't work 
 mirceaulinic   does the inotify event contain the diff or new and old file versions for me to compare and trigger my absent state  
 ch3ll i would love to  but i have no much understanding of salt internals for now and current implementation confuses me at some points  i state my idea like this    teach scheduler to differ jobs originated from config files and from pillar   and deny any modifications to jobs from pillar by  schedule  module is it ok 
thanks for the reply  gtmanfred  of course  attached state file can reliably reproduce the problem in a scientificlinux 6 8  which is in the same family with rhel  centos   one can obtain relevant iso files from  here  http   ftp1 scientificlinux org linux scientific 6 8 x86_64 iso   actual state file  renamed to   txt  since github didn't like sls extension    recreate_downgrade_bug txt  https   github com saltstack salt files 827362 recreate_downgrade_bug txt  if you need more info  help  anything  i will do my best to help  thanks  hakan
hi daniel  i was able to fix the issue  turns out salt api  salt master was installed under python 2 7 and salt ssh was installed under python 3 6 on the system i was running my tests on  once i fixed the versions salt ssh worked  you can close this issue  thanks for your time on this
i can install mysql just fine when run from apt on the command line  i get the same error when i run  salt ' id ' pkg install mysql server  this command works on ubuntu 14 04 but will not run on 16 04 2  if you need any further info let me know
 ch3ll here you go  master  i do know that the identical bootstrap process works correctly on ubuntu 18 04  so that leads me to believe its some kind of environment related bug specific to centos 7  i've played with the systemd unit files to add different after wants directives with no luck  additionally  subsequent reboots of the hosts work correctly every time and the behavior doesn't reappear  it only happens the first time the minion caches its key with the master and never re occurs as far as i have seen 
yes  i can replicate this on any os with the recent versions of salt 
specs you mean   they are mostly vps from digital ocean and linode  mostly 8 and 16gb servers  the mom is on a different provider  azure  and all the masters talk to azure  the azure has a whitelisted ip and port for salt and its masters  the masters have whitelisted ip for mom and its ports  not sure what else you would need 
yes  we did

hi  this is for all scripts  and my question is about saltstack taking this setting across all modules  because our security officer forbid us to execute anything in  tmp  defining tmpdir as an environment variable to the service is working fine as far  but i was just wondering if any module don't take this into account 
hello  thanks for your reply  salt version

tried  lorengordon's suggestion but no dice 
 ch3ll i'm not 100  sure of my previous functioning versions  i've been playing around with a lot of combinations   but trying out what i have available     both 2016 11 4   2016 11 5 masters appear to pull images fine with a 2015 8 8 minion  edit  i've just tested that a 2016 3 6 minion also works 
i spent some time reading up the code and how schemas et al are used in salt  here is a rough plan of what i'm thinking  please let me know if i'm going down the right path   i apologize in advance for numerous questions    i'd like to split this feature under multiple pull requests    add a new class for event schema placed in https   github com saltstack salt tree develop salt  i don't believe that event schema should be placed in utils    along with the class  we can have schema files for each "event type"  tag   the schema will be of type https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt utils schema py   a global dict of tag     schema class mapping   update fire_event and get_event methods here https   github com saltstack salt blob develop salt utils event py to support validating schema before sending and after receiving the message   the above will be split into two parts  part 1 will validate but will let invalid schema go through   part 2 will validate and error out  this should be a flag in config for backward compatibility    we should remove this flag in a version after so we enforce schema everywhere some questions    do we have an easy way to get a list of all tags and events that salt sends internally   pending    i haven't hatched out the detail of how to extend events similar to modules but i believe we can do the same as module to extend events and event dictionary   cachedout  thatch45  ch3ll your views on the above  
hey  i investigated our setup further and discovered the mistake was down to human error  so no bug

i realized that i had seen something similar earlier this week  issue #17284 had a commit proposed that is extremely similar to my posted patch  then was reverted in issue #18206  the committed code at the time was failing the test suite  i will try to spin up a test environment  but i'm really short on time right now  to clarify why the order is a problem  when specifying the port and ip address configuration to sshd_config  sshd requires that the port statement comes before the address statements  yes  the template can be modified with dictsort reverse for this specific problem  but i feel that being able to manage an arbitrary data order is reasonable and helpful  having the order of the pillar data reflected in rendered data helps visually verify correctness and in the case where a human must read through the file manually can save a man's sanity  i can confirm that distributing this change in my salt environment has resolved my ordering issue with formula ssh and for  samba formula  https   github com saltstack formulas samba formula  for rhel and centos 6   7  for the dev team  i did try to create an exttype hook for ordereddict  but the logic in msgpack python detects the object as a dict before running the default object evaluation code unless we call loads with strict_types true  i don't know what that would break 
 damon atkins for example  start firefox installed by an unprivileged user 
 garethgreenaway no that pr does not address this issue  i was waiting for a confirmation on the issue since the pr will require some refactoring of the couchbase returner  i will open a pr for this soon 
i recreated the example and ran saltutil refresh_pillar and saltutil refresh_beacons which both returned true  before running the command below  heres the output of the command u asked

 ch3ll hey   sorry for not being clear   i meant previously when i was using glob matching   not previously in a different version of salt  so   the only difference between successful remote signing and not successful was the glob vs pcre match   gtmanfred ah  i see it has already been addressed in develop

just to let you know i haven't forgotten about this  i have the updated files but haven't yet put them on a machine to test  i hope to do so and close this some time this week 
it works as it should and forwards to systemd 
not exactly  it was a 2018 release  maybe mdadm changed its behavior
sure thing  however how should it be handled  just ignore it and as such restore previous behaviour but effectively revert the intention of #26780  or generate a meaningful  __id__  based on the data available 
the pr is at https   github com saltstack salt pull 45793

i do not have any specific log  which log can i provide   when i replace http   localhost with http   10 x x x it is working fine  when i test with curl command both http   localhost and http   10 x x x  works fine  does http wait_for_successful_query hard coded for listen http code on specific network interface   eth0   
 garethgreenaway this is similar to linked issue but that issue talks about checking the return code  and possibly modifying code paths for different return codes   as seen in supervisor discussion page  return codes have a lot of interchangeable meanings  process stopped or fatal both return 3   since salt already uses textual parsing to deduce state of individual processes from the output  imo it would be better to disregard the return codes altogether 
while it would solve the problem it would hide all the other output  if i could make just a single state terse that would solve my problem  in the documentation does exclude work like that  i can’t tell if it excludes the whole state or not

 garethgreenaway i've only used the pex built salt packages thus far  so i can't speak to if it works with the apt packages or other sources
for the record  the correct syntax is  nftables append filter output rule "ip daddr 1 1 1 1 tcp dport 443 accept"   and yes it works because the rule is passed straight down to the execution step  i'm talking about the  nftables  state  i renamed and edited my report accordingly  sorry for the confusion 
 garethgreenaway i am very appreciated for your supporting  i am sure there is no other salt minion process running when i do this check   if you need any more information   please tell me and i can double check thanks a lot   
sorry for the very delayed reply here  i missed this 
i've done a pr  for the different percentage between  psutil  and  df   it is a bug that has been fixed on newer python  it didn't take in count the reserved space 
 ch3ll hi  i used curl as the http client and call salt api to modify  etc hosts  here is my command   here are screenshots which may be helpful    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2890053 44261345 f31ee280 a249 11e8 994b 29227392539c png  when i open it in vim    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2890053 44261372 0af66680 a24a 11e8 9128 4ef8d62bfc9d png  i just found another  issue  https   github com saltstack salt issues 48967  which may be relative with mine  thank you 
 gtmanfred thanks for your fast response  i've recreated the environment  so the minion ids won't match the initial issue report  sorry for that  i rejected minion id  20bbfa446701426d9313d53373d7a0c3  this time    glob matching  fine    i fear the only way to include "new"  as in unknown to salt  minion ids is using the list matcher and the compound matcher by extension  the rest of matchers seem to only work on the subset of well known minion ids  and thus  are not affected from what i can see 
 garethgreenaway good question  should be easy to set up a container with f27 and test it  i can try if i get around to it  if it helps 
 garethgreenaway when i run mine get i get the following 
 dwoz i made changes to the service name  installer directory and installer ui and icons  it works well in windows server 2012  facing issue in windows server 2008 
yes  i fully restart master and salt api  but it still can't work  i use 2017 7 7 version  is there any other change i need do  have you tested 2 grains match on eauth part  many thanks 
this is for salt modules nxos py      not      salt proxy fx2 py  what i am saying is  the patch for the fx2 py resolved the issue with the salt cisco nx os bug    that i opened this issue about 
same problem as i can see  this code was not touched for 2 years and was not working from start  i can provide small pr with fix
 garethgreenaway hi gareth  no i don't  i installed it using pip but still am getting the same errors  here is some output  just to prove that consul is returning something 
i tried this before but didn't work same error message show that pkg installed not found in sls   i tried change back to pkg installed again today  and it works     looks like maybe is my salt master and minion connection problem  thanks 
 garethgreenaway the desktop has linux image generic hwe 16 04 installed but it's a 4 15 0 version not 4 4 0   thanks  simon

sorry about that  garethgreenaway   place i was discussing was https   docs saltstack com en latest topics cloud vmware html#profiles  many configuration options are listed  but the configuration_spec item is missing  if you want to use the  customization  true   which is default   you need to list a customization profile 
yes  but it works only for create instance 
anyway  salt 2018 3 3  python 2 7  centos 7 host  salt from 'official' saltstack repository  shouldn't matter much  the issue lies here  https   github com saltstack salt blob df1f9e9b23aa604c9df07388ecaae83c8b627b1f salt netapi rest_cherrypy app py#l1897  same or roughly same code in 2018 3 3  also discussed on  #develop  in the salt slack workspace yesterday  to pro actively answer other questions    this is unrelated to any of my salt states or whatever   this is not related to any specific action modules   this is related to a discrepancy between how the  e auth framework works   salt auth __init__   and what  netapi  modules   route handlers do if unclear  let me know 
很抱歉上次没有表达清楚我的意思，咱们现在的模块只是支持localport 但是我想要remoteport，请问一下咱们有其他方法满足我的需求嘛？我想要限制本地访问目标的指定端口。我用的是咱们的执行模块：salt modules win_firewall add_rule name  localport  protocol 'tcp'  action 'allow'  dir 'in'  remoteip 'any'  https   docs saltstack com en latest ref modules all salt modules win_firewall html#salt modules win_firewall add_rule
unfortunately   or fortunately   we upgraded all our minions to version 2019 2 0 this week and we no longer have this issue  thus  i close this issue  thank your for your answer   
i didn't but i added one as a requisite of the python docker module that you can already see and re run it  it still fails in the same highstate with the same exception  it seems as if it passes the wrong value to call 
 garethgreenaway yes i get only one salt minion on the windows10   hope you reproduce the issue    
thanks for looking into this 
the command is  salt run salt cmd svn checkout  tmp svn   svn server testrepo 
 ch3ll i've given up tracking the pages as there were so many  so as one example  try states pkg  https   docs saltstack com en latest ref states all salt states pkg html  screenshot also attached as you mention rendering problem  screenshot taken on firefox 72 0 1   red arrows are my addition  obviously     img width "1018" alt "saltshot" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 6958684 72542876 c32fa080 387c 11ea 801f 76baf4b0eedc png" 
i confirm that applying the following patch to salt 2019 2 3   and restarting the  salt minion  process solves the issue  thanks
