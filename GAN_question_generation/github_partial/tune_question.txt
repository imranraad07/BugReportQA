shouldn't you have to write   do bar  "testing"   +opt            seems like an argument mode checking error 
can you give some more information please  this builds and runs just fine for me  i'm on linux  using both 1 3 stable and the nightly from 9 17 
would’ve been fixed ish by https   github com rust lang rust pull 29848 
could you also put those last two sections in  code  formatting to help us read it more easily 
could you gist the commands you're using to reproduce  also  what target are you using for this 
could you write it in llvm bitcode instead  i think we're hoping to use as little assembly as possible  in order to make supporting different processor types easy 
how are you testing this  when i try it  the compiler just straight up rejects the program 
what commit version are you using 
would they remain uncapitalized  if so they would be a very big exception to our naming conventions 
does it really make sense to pass  option int   to a generic math function making use of  add   mul  
can you provide a testcase showing that occurring  it should not do so 
can we support just enough to do this in the most palatable way possible 
do you mean if if "is_some" returns true  option mutate returns true  if else  does it return false 
does  use self  extra  json  work  imports are relative to the top of the crate  not the current mod 
would you review my pr 
would a crater run be sufficient to evaluate the impact 
can you try 3038f30f96fe366e910f9a02521c5a06e5cdc653  the commit before  alexcrichton's larger rollup  
do plugin crates allow exporting macros  the implementation is similar 
where does the macro definition above introduce a  token  interpolated  
should we add this to perf  seems like maybe yes
can you point out examples where this is happening  just curious which instances you're referring to 
would using  changing  transaction  scan  to  pub fn scan  'a mut self    https   play rust lang org  version nightly mode debug edition 2018 gist 2dbf8ebb9c30ce5e81ba2e1b6c50c42f  work for you 
do you know where it gets included from  i have  libunwind  installed as a dependency of  perf   but i haven't run into this 
should this be in rust lang rfcs 
do you have a test that shows the behavior you're describing 
what is the signature of  bytes_vec_mut  
what's the error that you're seeing when running the test 
what are the differences between android and linux gdb 
what system are you running on and can you provide the exact invocations of  rustc   i'm unable to reproduce this on osx and linux so far 
could you provide some code that reproduces the ice 
what happens if you remove  mod protobuf  
can you expand on this 
what happens if you do a make clean and rebuild 
maybe something travis specific  can you try to upgrade to the latest 1 36 0 and see if it still happens 
could you run rustc under gdb  set a breakpoint in rust_task_fail and paste the backtrace here 
why not have  rust  resurrected as a separate project 
what's the output you get with  rust_log rustc  metadata  loader  
don't we already get an expression id in  trans_intrinsic    ref_id  iirc 
should only one be printed 
what about  define   to parallel c 
maybe a dup of https   github com rust lang rust issues 19035   seems similar 
why not split unused_variables and unused_parameters 
do you know of a way to minimize to something other than  rust postgres  
what happens if you change  'self  to  'a  
does that resolve the ambiguity here 
which target is this for  there are multiple calling conventions across operating systems and architectures after all 
can you paste the output of  rustc   emit ir foo rs  
can you describe how you compiled this code and how you compiled the compiler 
could you try running  make distclean  in the repo  this is normally indicative of an outdated crate 
does it render correctly  if not it may be a bug in the mardown parser 
would you mind gisting an entire transcript of the make configure logs 
couldn't you split it 
could you point me at the documentation which says that this should be allowed 
how would this work  the backing storage for  arc t   and  rc t   is two  usize s bigger than that of  box t    or would this not be a "free" conversion 
what does this have to do with  env  var   it doesn't seem to be mentioned in that output 
could you provide a small test case as an example  last i tried i was unable to get a linker error when i tried things like this  cc #11124
do you have a link to the code that causes this  we're working on making a auto reducer  and we're curious what happens to this 
why is it misleading 
can you report this bug at bugs llvm org 
can you provide the exact  rustc  invocation you were using  i'm unable to reproduce this locally 
what version of rustc did you execute this with  i think this should have been fixed by #11525
do you have the full log of a session  i just tried to reproduce this but was unable to 
what happens if you remove the  rust  undefined behavior  namely  writing to  null   
maybe we should do some messaging to alert people  optimally rustc could simply deny compilation if the abi doesn't match 
could you give a few cases where you think this might be useful 
what needs to be done to fix this 
do you have an example of a code snippet to reproduce this ice 
did you come up with any good workaround for this issue 
can this be closed 
can simply be reworded as  expected concrete lifetime is 'a as defined on the block at     what say 
why does this happen    
would you mind giving it another try 
do we expect that to be a sizeable group or not 
how would that interact with  rustc   test  and  cargo test  
can you give me an example 
could you clarify 
maybe i should rather attach this post to the error message 
can you provide a stack trace of the crash when using gcc 4 8 
does building  tensile  also result in "unresolved external symbols" linker errors 
what happens if you do  rustflags  ccodegen units 1 cargo_incremental 0 cargo bench   cc  alexcrichton
did you remember to enable debuginfo 
does rustdoc produce anything for this 
does that suffice for your use case 
can you reproduce this with a more recent rustc build nightly somehow  it errors properly without an ice for me 
doesn't   char  is_alphabetic   https   doc rust lang org beta std primitive char html#method is_alphabetic  fulfill this need  after cursory look at  the code  it seems to be doing exactly what you'd want  https   github com rust lang rust blob 13a2dd9 src librustc_unicode char rs#l530 l552  
can you please paste the output of  gcc   version   please note that if mingw is on the path  it takes precedence over the packaged version 
could someone post a stack trace with debuginfo 
did you import the  endoffile  variant 
do you remember how recently  aiui  i think this should've been fixed by https   github com rust lang rust pull 15597 
can you still reproduce on a recent nigthly 
can you provide a smaller example and a more detailed description about how to reproduce 
which version of rustdoc are you using  it works fine for me using 1 27 stable and newer    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 7189418 42661299 b2b21ed2 8625 11e8 88b8 acfee8e81e3b png 
why is locking each mutex individually insufficient 
can you provide the code that causes the ice as well 
why this should be moved into rustc 
how would they interact with  osstr   osstring  from  std  
why can't the parser unambiguously detect that      denotes a range in that context 
what does  rustc   version  output 
does it still ice 
what should it be equivalent to 
could you check the output of  rustc  v verbose   the "host " part indicates whether it is win32   i686    or win64   x86_64    
do you have an example of code that produces this crash 
could you please help with this problem  thanks a lot 
does this issue have something to do with the performance problem described in #37939 
did you ever investigate further 
maybe an hybrid system  if some specific keywords are entered  we propose a link to the corresponding chapter of the book 
could you include the implementations of the traits   just so it's easy to reproduce test  
do we get any benefits from this  if we still support older llvm versions  cc  alexcrichton  badboy
did you see this not as the behavior though 
can you provide more assistance in debugging as well  for example what was at line 896 of lib rs  what configuration did you provide  etc 
do you have an example of code that behaves differently on windows than other targets 
what's the benefit of the proxy type over just using an  fn  trait object directly 
maybe a duplicate of #45689  
can you edit your first message and add triple backticks graves  
can you please clarify that this is a tracking issue  you can take https   github com rust lang rust issues 63569 as an example  or anything else with the  c tracking issue  https   github com rust lang rust labels c tracking issue  label 
can you expand on why we should link to  tostring  from these pages  we link to  display  which is necessary to implement  format  "  "       
do you propose to remove that linker option  may seem obvious  but you didn't state that 
could you try again with today's nightly please  i think you need rustc   9th june
do these tests pass with a stage1 compiler that  doesn't  include the llvm change  ime  stage1 test suite almost never suceeds 
maybe double check to make sure you aren't specifying    bin   i just tried again  and it works fine for me  i am also on the latest nightly 
what  n  did you use  also  it would be convenient if you could paste the log of the compilation to make diagnosing the problem easier  thanks 
how is this different from  the never       type  https   doc rust lang org nightly std primitive never html   in fact  that page mentions  infallible errors  https   doc rust lang org nightly std primitive never html#infallible errors  with the same wording 
what are the contents of those files 
did you get any warnings   foo err bar     ought to know that  foo  is dead there   
why not fix that instead of regressing compile times of almost every crate ever written  even the  # inline always    on the  from  impls seems to much  a normal  # inline   should suffice 
could i make a const array that usize long 
would you be ok reopening the issue over there  thanks 
which compiler version are you using 
shouldn't llvm config output this requirement  btw for anyone reading this  a quick fix is to add   to  src librustc_llvm lib rs  
does that make sense 
what's your rust version 
do the fix steps there work 
how about posting the code to see what causes the error    
can you run  du  on the dsym file if you get a chance 
did you set  in your cargo toml 
does this reproduce on 1 2 0  or nightly   if not  could you provide us the source 
what if there was a lint to enforce this  like  # deny missing_unsafe_docs   
does rebuilding libcore  via xargo or  cargo  z build std       help 
maybe a lint which warns when this  impl method  https   github com rust lang rust blob master src libcore clone rs#l54  is invoked could help  because i don't think this is ever intended when someone explicitly uses   clone    
maybe a problem in llvm  the rust side doesn't do anything architecture specific  as far as i know 
what's your code 
can you be a bit more specific  what exactly is the error you're getting 
can you provide the entirety of the code that you tried to compile 
could you provide some more information or some example code   steps to reproduce this 
why should it error 
may i take this issue 
what this suggests to me is that there are no unit tests for e0463  how should i proceed 
why isn't the same argument true for  repeat   isn't the size available via  layout size    
where is that quote from exactly  not in the top level readme md 
can this be a memory safety issue 
could you elaborate on the rationale for this  do other compilers do this  e g  msvc or clang 
does that make sense 
does that solve what you're thinking of here 
what's your linkage model 
does the section in the book answer these questions  should we model it after that  or just have it refer to the book 
what if you modified the  target  https   github com rust lang rust blob master src librustc_back target arm_unknown_linux_gnueabi rs#l25  to use  v5   together with  arm unknown linux gnueabi mk  https   github com rust lang rust blob master mk cfg arm unknown linux gnueabi mk  
does powerpc do something different that means it matters more here 
how can one reproduce this 
do you have some more info  is this something users experience  or is it mostly custom drivers running into problems 
what's the definition of  termios  look like  if that's incorrect  e g  too small  then the syscall could corrupt the stack  for reference here's  the definition in  libc   https   github com rust lang libc blob 04213bbac5e66c59482cf80ed47ec886e30ed8f7 src unix bsd apple mod rs#l236  
could you try a newer nightly build  this should be fixed  #31561 
what is the cargo project you are building  what cargo invocation are you using that issues the first set of errors 
does  cargo clean  fix it  from the backtrace it seems like yet another instance of #33778 this issue is really hitting a lot of people   
how would you improve it  it seems pretty clear for me     
why are you relying on unstable features for  umm  stable tooling     pretty  et al by now are only used for debugging purposes and won’t be stabilised 
would it also be possible to move  delimspan  inside  delimited   or would that not help 
can you provide a small example to reproduce the ice  with the custom types you used it's difficult for us to bisect reproduce ourself   
do you use any unstable features  might be existential type related
should we audit libstd for other types that don't need to be there 
does this panic on 1 19 beta   nightly 
how does  pthread_once_t  deal with this issue  we've been thinking a bit about switching to the system primitives instead of rolling our own 
can you elaborate on why nonoverlapping is useful to you in volatile  much of its advantage over regular copy is in optimizations  many of which are turned off for volatile   
can you upload or post the file somewhere 
maybe you should rename your issue with "x py check fails for everything except core and std" 
maybe something like here https   github com rust lang rust pull 61926 files  edit  explained in https   github com rust lang rust pull 61926#discussion_r295283708
what's the stderr output 
would that work 
could this possibly be a bug with futures or tokio 
could you give an example  i'm not sure i understand why there is expected to be a difference between a lambda and a function 
can you use strace to figure out which system call is failing 
do you mind 
could you show your config toml  otherwise i don't think this is really actionable    not sure what 'ignores stuff' means either    what do you expect to happen that didn't 
could you re file this against https   github com rust lang rust www please  thanks 
however  a bit more explanations could be useful  any idea  quietmisdreavus 
does it happen after    x py clean  as well 
how many total threads are you spawning  what kind of platform are you running on 
what's the exact issue on nightly  this is expected not to work on stable beta
does running  cmake  from the console work 
could you check wether this ice is present in stable or beta 
what's the use of such an api that isn't covered by  with_capacity  already 
maybe it would be possible to have a codegen test to make sure 
what results do you get with   ccodegen units 1  
can you post here the code that crashes the compiler 
couldn't  rustfix  interpret them that way 
could you confirm that 
what os are you using  this might be a case of https   github com rust lang rust issues 49438
does that also happen on nightly  do you have a   small   codeexample that does trigger that error 
can you attempt to obtain a backtrace or coredump 
could you provide the codebase which caused this error  otherwise i think we'll have to close this as it's not actionable without a test case 
maybe it was just accepted because it was just a move 
maybe what   doc comment   https   docs rs doc comment  does could help 
can you verify wether you hit the same output on 1 27 
why does clippy depend on rustfmt  we only have it in our travis tests  and even then a test fail shouldn't cause an unshipped tool
what if you have multible structs  rc   when to print which 
what's your  rustc +nightly   version' 
does the ropi rwpi relocation model work 
do you have a screenshot please  also on a precise page would be useful  it's very likely a css issue 
can you try  cargo clean  and running  cargo test  again 
could you re file this against https   github com rust lang nursery mdbook please  thank you 
can you please re file this against https   github com rust lang book  thank you 
can you provide an example of this  is this due to debuginfo included in the binary 
can you provide an example or  playground  https   play rust lang org   that causes this error 
how would the default impl work if the type doesn't implement  partialeq  
would it be possible to get the sample file that is referenced in the error message  use   csave temps  and   ccodegen units 1   
what is your filesystem for   home   is this local or remote location 
maybe we should take  the old contents  https   web archive org web 20180924035000 https   buildbot2 rust lang org homu   and throw it in a markdown file in  the repo  https   github com rust lang homu  and link to that 
can you post the output  i cannot reproduce this in  the playground for any release  https   play rust lang org  version nightly mode debug edition 2018 gist 1280559edac71d09e31e3aecc32201a6  
can you please  rust_backtrace full cargo doc  and post the result here 
why is there even an element to do  spacing   of all things 
will this search degrade gracefully  using the existing mdbook search  when the service isn't reachable 
can you run with    emit llvm ir  and provide the   ll  file 
can you provide the source code needed to reproduce this 
can you produce a backtrace for the crash  i'm assuming it happens somewhere in the panic implementation 
what distro and hardware are you building on  can you post the output of  uname  a  
which version of python are you using 
could you provide the code that caused this  ideally  a minimal example would be best 
can you please explain what kind of bug you are talking about and how this might be incorrect 
wouldn't it be sufficient to prepend something to  path  and  ld_library_path  
can you try the code with a recent nightly and see if it reproduces 
wouldn't a "refresh" of the index right before the search solve this 
do you recreate it each time  i ran it on a 3 node cluster and the last stats returns fine  running on master  which i believe you are as well   
what is the expected output of the search at the end of the script 
maybe its a race condition issue  if you create the  elastic_searchable  index first  wait a bit  and then index with percolation  does that work well then 
can you give it a go  maybe it also fixes the other issue 
can't you just use the  weight  attribute of a function  instead of  influencescore   20   you do  weight  0 2 
may i ask what you are missing from the default one  maybe we could just improve it 
what is the aim  performance improvements  immutability for the sake of a cleaner system or better security 
which version of es did you use when this problem occurred 
did you see a case where you needed a different execution mode 
did logstash that you started had an elasticsearch version 0 18 x  was it on the same box as elasticsearch 
why don't you wanna wrap it   isn't that good enough 
does that resolve your issue  if so can you please close the issue 
how about simply calling "tostring" on the object you get back  it should work well for everything except binary ones  base64 shenanigans 
can you confirm that  what are you trying to do    build from sources    play with elasticsearch 0 21 0 beta1 snapshot    just want to play with elasticsearch latest stable release 
which version of elasticsearch are you using  did you change anything in elasticsearch configuration 
how much memory does the id_cache take  are you running low on jvm memory  how much of the heap used  
where did you get theses instructions 
wouldn't it be easier to build a  terms  query instead of a  match  if you already know which terms you would like to query 
would that be all that useful though  i mean  if this is a common idiom then  yeah  but it doesn't strike me as common 
can you provide a full gist that reproduces this problem 
will the automated notarization script leave the paths as they were prior to notarization 
do the queries vary that much  a sample one would be a great start  i wonder specifically if you list fields to be returned as part of the search request 
can it be made to say  coming in 0 90 6  
can you retry and report back  i just tested with a fresh ubuntu vm and it worked on that one 
can you make sure that both java applications are using the same version of the jvm  even minor version  and retry 
can you check what has you build that from 
which version are you using 
can i see how many shards are per node for these indices  can you provide your setting too like concurrent rebalance etc 
do you perform terms aggregations on your string fields  if yes then this memory usage is due to global ordinals that elasticsearch builds on top of doc values 
can you expand a bit on what you did and what would help in your case 
could you please open it in https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch lang groovy project 
what is your elasticsearch version 
does  curl localhost 9200 _stats  help here maybe 
do you have a full stacktrace where the excception occurs 
can you give examples 
maybe it is worth adapting to make this api work with java api too 
does anyone who knows more want to take a look 
do you see it differently  markwalkom 
did you install java without using yum rpm  if so  that is the problem  if you do have java installed via rpm  who produced the package  what does the package provide 
why not using nodes info api  you will have a cluster wide overview  http   www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current cluster nodes info html#cluster nodes info
could you give 2 0 0 beta1 a go and let us know if it has addressed your needs 
which version of elasticsearch are you running 
what kind of errors are you getting from the reindex api 
can you share curl call instead of code samples  this makes it easier to see what your doing  i'm unfamiliar with the api calls   code that you're sharing 
why on earth would you want to add this complexity to elasticsearch  honestly  i'd prefer to remove the source transform script altogether 
what version is this on 
do you know how deep these mappings went  could we reasonably pick "100" as the limit for nesting 
should this be a safeguard or just a hard limit 
which plugins and versions are you using 
did you install icu plugin version 2 2 0 
maybe xcontentquerybuilder or something along those lines 
may be we can close this one 
could you talk about your use case s  
what version of es is this  this issue should already have been fixed  can you try this on 1 3 1 
why are you trying to use pagination with scroll 
do you get any error message 
can you elaborate a bit more  
can we close this one 
what does the query agg look like 
could you be more explicit about exactly what requests you are running on which nodes 
can you reproduce the issue  are there any errors in the logs  i'm looking for something like concurrentmodificationexception  but it may be something else   
can you give an example where it does not 
can we just make geopoint immutable without adding another class 
what version es kibana are you using   can you open head plugin or just   in a browser  
could you check that again 
what is on jcenter which is not available on maven central 
why are you logging to a unc path anyway 
can you set the discovery logger to  trace   that we show use more about the individual pings that go out 
could it explain your issue 
how much heap space have you allocated to es 
maybe we should have a character limit on the comments to help with this 
could you open an issue in rss river project  
could you give details on what you exactly did  and versions 
what version of es are you using  and do the hot nodes have more primary shards than others  also  how many shards per node in total 
what kind of store do you use  are you using  "index store type"  "memory"  by any chance 
how many shards  how many repl  what is your index status of these 4 shards 
would you like to send a pr to update the docs 
what is the actual error you are getting  also  how did you install elasticsearch on your system  
does that get you what you're looking for 
maybe we could simply add the node uuid and the cluster uuid to the shard key  cc  polyfractal
do you have any custom config your  config elasticsearch yml  file 
could you talk more about your use case 
what happens in the new suggester  areek 
what gives  bin elasticsearch plugin list  
how many master eligible nodes do you have  and what is the value of  discovery zen minimum_master_nodes  
did you set  minimum_master_nodes   can you check the current master for all nodes during such an event by calling  get _cat master  
what are permissions of  home user  can you do something like  where  elasticsearch  is the user name that you run elasticsearch under 
can you reproduce this problem and if so can you switch on debug logging so we can see what's going on 
what is your maven version 
can't we just do this by default 
can you try  arcdistanceinmiles  instead in the script and see if results are as expected 
does it work when you replace  query_string  with a  match_all  query   and or when you remove the  range  filter  
what is the reason that makes you want this feature 
can you upload them here please  https   upload staging elstc co u 0079f0c8 8f70 43b6 bec4 f8f84e45541a certainly interested in the one you have analysed above  but if there are others that look different then please share them too 
do you mean  this  https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current docs index_ html#timeout  
can you look at the nodes log file and paste me the stacktrace for this exception 
did you see that somewhere in docs  you should do that on the client side  may be using an alias would help you 
did you confirm this on 1 7 
maybe we should simply fail or document the fact that  scroll  and  rescore  don't play well together  
do you have local modifications of elasticsearch  if not can you try to pull latest changes and run "mvn clean" before trying to build the package again 
how about using   des path conf      in the meanwhile 
can you add the full query here  i cannot reproduce this 
what would you change 
which version of elasticsearch and which version of ubuntu 
can you describe more complete requests interactions 
could you please open a thread on discuss elastic co instead 
should we move forward on this  it looks like a low hanging fruit that has the potential to make things significantly better for most users 
do you see any odd behavior due to those primaries 
can you share your elasticsearch yml file  you can anonymize it 
can you print the result of  get _cat plugins v  please 
could you check whether you can reproduce the bug with a more recent version of elasticsearch 
do you have a stack trace in the logs below the nullpointerexception 
what happens if you don't install your plugin  are you using the official distribution  or are you building your own elasticsearch version 
could you reduce your recreation to something simple  and point out exactly what problem i should look for 
could you give us some examples 
why not changing the level to  debug  for  org elasticsearch cluster metadata metadatadeleteindexservice  in your log4j file instead 
will this be sufficient  just set it when you create the index 
would you be able to share a heap dump of the node upon oome  or if that is too sensitive  screenshots of a heap analysis tool showing the top consumers 
could you rerun your tests and ensure that the template exists in elasticsearch before you index any docs 
what does it give in elasticsearch 2 2 in term of response time  did you try it 
could you give both requests ard responses so that we can compare 
can you provide thread dumps of the nodes that are stuck  what happens if you delete the snapshot that is stuck  does that unblock the nodes 
maybe just the hot_threads api  though it might not work because of the breaker  
can you be more specific about what does not work 
do you mean symlinked  that's probably your problem 
can you upgrade and verify 
do you mean transaction logs or files in the  logs   directory 
when does this fail  when you execute the first command or the second one 
why are you setting  index version created  
can you please do an  ls  in   usr share elasticsearch lib   and past the output here  it seems like the upgrade did not remove all previously installed files 
how many nodes do you have in this cluster 
do you have multiple nodes and you unmount the share only on some of them 
what version are you using 
can you clarify one thing  it seems that you are using your own docker image and not the official docker image provided by elastic  is that correct 
what logic could we apply to choose the other ip automatically  and in a generic  non docker specific way  
would you like to send a pr 
how big of an overhead would be for you to use a specific client instance for long running operations  do you have an example of requests that would need that 
can you please specify the os version 
can you maybe give concrete examples of api calls and responses

can u show a perf comparison before and with the change 
can you elaborate on "failed due to a numpy dependency which couldn't install automatically"  what went wrong 
why would you _not_ put all of the masked stuff in a single if 
how is this different than the already existing  df groupby     apply        apart from the ability to pass a tuple in pipe 
what version pandas 
can u put up the exact steps u used to create the virtualenv and build pandas 
why would you not simply use  replace  for that  which can do all of what you are talking about   if its not parser related 
why would you not just copy and add  or just construct a new one and concat 
what does  ts1 1 1  mean 
can you give an example plot 
can u post the starting indexes  or a facsimile  
would you like to give it a shot  prob need to enhance  convert_objects  to deal with this 
can you share the data that generated the plot   or some fake data that gives a similar picture 
what is an actual usecase of doing this 
what version were you using 
does this not work 
can you show what you were doing for a regular array  this shouldn't be the case    going to reopen  seg faults are bad    
would require significant effort from someone familiar with c cython volunteering 
can you ref the issues 
do you have nans  and what is the result of  stateemp area values mean    
can you attach the script which include the sample data preparation 
do we just need to add an entry in https   github com macpython pandas wheels blob master  travis yml for 32 bit manylinux

does this help  http   stackoverflow com questions 24122850 pandas valueerror numpy dtype has the wrong size try recompiling http   stackoverflow com questions 17709641 valueerror numpy dtype has the wrong size try recompiling
what do you think should happen 
can you show an actual code example  and could you link to the actual page  yahoo or google  that the data is coming from  thank 
what exactly is the problem 
why how are you using apply 
do we apply reset_index attribute in case someone passes the 'as_index' param 
can you expand your example a bit  this would be writing an excel file where some of the cells are actual formulas 
what version of pandas and openpyxl are you using   please show the output of  pd show_versions    
does your proposed method solve the case when your object defines  __iter__  
would you like to submit a pr that adds a link to this issue in the documentation 
can you give some more details  show the resulting table schema that you get  and what you would want 
can you show  pd show_versions     this is working correctly for me on master and with 0 17 1  code snippet to test
would you be able to test with that as well 
can you show an example of what you are doing 
maybe consider not using commas in your data or using something other than commas  like pipes  to delimit your file 
why are you doing this  or are these actual values 
can you clarify with a numerical example   i 0  means it starts from the present  it then decays as time passes  as you'd expect from an exponential function 
can you make a pr updating the docstring to indicate that the order follows the same results as the  dataframe  constructor  and link to those docs 
do you have a rough plan for the next dateutil release 
can you post your versions of all matplotlib's  required dependencies  http   matplotlib org users installing html#required dependencies  
what version of numpy 
can you check that you're using the same version of numpy  i think this could actually be an issue with numpy 1 10 adjusting its casting rules   
what do you get if you multiply a series instead of a dataframe 
did you mean otherwise in your comment  i would be happy to send a pr for this 
do you want  df1 drop df1 columns 0    axis 1   
can you provide a reproducible example  a small code snippet that constructs a dataframe and that shows this error 
can you make a reproducible example  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you show an example of where this is failing 
where does this come from  in this case there are no matches  yet you need an index  what would you have it do 
could you post a snippet of code that causes this  and your  versions  https   github com pydata pandas blob master contributing md#bug reports and enhancement requests   note that hdf5 is not threadsafe for simultaneous writes 
can you confirm that  and close this issue if so  the short version is  this is a difference in behavior between numpy bottleneck and pandas 
what exactly is the problem  you are showing lots of code which makes this very hard to grok
can you give a pseudo code example of how this would work   constructor  usage  etc   compared to using just one o c
what would i propose to name this option 
can you try on 0 24 2  i think this was fixed by https   github com pandas dev pandas pull 25266 
can you see if you can confirm it is fixed  and if so  would also be nice to add some tests to keep it working 
can you please provide a reproducible example   some code that constructs an example dataframe and shows the problem 
could you make a reproducible example   files  is undefined  also   pd show_versions  
what exactly are you trying to do   using groupby in this way is very very odd
can u show a reproducible example of what the issue is 
why  you are mixing 2 distinct and different data types  better to be much more explicit 
would the performance impact be just too much then 
why would you not just select the columns you need before calling   itertuples  
did you see it on previous versions of  pandas  by any chance 
do you have the same pandas and scipy versions on both 
can you try with master  i think this may have been fixed by https   github com pandas dev pandas pull 16150
can you try on master  there's a chance this is fixed by some of the recent inference changes  if it isn't not a pr would be welcome
can you post the output of  warnings filters   it seems unlikely  but it's possible to filter warnings form specific libraries 
how is this different than #4988  
would you be interested in submitting a pull request to update https   github com pandas dev pandas blob master doc source cookbook rst with an example 
can you check if you have a  maybe empty   pyqt4  directory in your site packages  removing that should fix it 
can you provide a copy pastable example 
could please make a  minimal  complete  and verifiable example  https   stackoverflow com help mcve   thanks
could you try this in a more recent pandas  it seems to work for me in 0 20 2 
can you provide an example 
what are you checking for monotonicity 
do you see another table added somewhere 
would setting that to 0 be equivalent to bias true 
could you do the same thing for what you're currently seeing  that would be equally beneficial  cc  tomaugspurger
could you also post the actual output that you're seeing and the output that you expect 
what version of pandas are you using   some things were fixed only in 0 20 2 
what exactly are you trying to accomplish here 
would it be possible to provide the visual that you're seeing now  and if possible  what you would expect   cc  tomaugspurger
can you show  pd show_versions    how'd you install pandas 
could you do some profiling to look where times differ 
could you provide a reproducible example by creating a small table in memory  using python's  sqlite  library  that will cause this error to surface 
do you have an example where this is incorrect 
do you have any interest in writing a pr to fix it 
could you give an example  you're already allowed to add arbitrary attributes to a dataframe  so you could add a dict and put stuff in there 
can you run the code in https   github com pandas dev pandas issues 19340#issuecomment 359416261 and check if that fails 
wouldn't  df iloc  3   always achieve the same thing then 
could you provide us a reproducible code example 
why do you think it should  and did this cause an issue for you  it doesn't recognize  nonetype  as null either 
how do you represent multiple part keys in json 
would this be in addition to or in place of the usual  pandas_metadata  
did this behavior work in a previous version of  pandas  
can you installing the  master  branch an re running your code 
what exactly resulting in a error  what environment  
does anyone know what it's supposed to do beyond the one sentence description in the docstring 
can you try making a simple  reproducible example that demonstrates the issue  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports we can't use pickle files for a unit test 
what do you mean by an "implicit way"   cc  jreback
can you try with the new  gcc_linux 64     gxx_linux 64    https   conda io docs user guide tasks build packages compiler tools html#anaconda compiler tools
why would you need this  you'd be much better off just assigning those scalar values as individual columns   this seems rather hacky
can you try constructing the series and dataframe outside the timed loop  i doubt that is the issue  but it’d be good to rule out 
what's your expected output here  you can't have non datetime64 values inside a datetime64 column 
can you clarify your confusion about  isin   that returns a boolean array of values that are or aren't in the passed values  what's your expected output for  isin  
can you try on master 
can you try in an environment with  nomkl  
can you double check your pandas version 
can i work on this issue 
can you create a  minimal  sample to recreate the issue  this is a rather large one so harder to reason about than it needs to be
could you please post a copy pasteable example  your example is not reproducible http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you provide a  minimal  code example to reproduce the issue  there are way too many moving parts here to effectively isolate the issue
why not use use pathlib 
can you step through the traceback and check where things break  it may be difficult for someone other than yourself to debug 
what makes you think this issue is with pandas and not spark 
can you post the full traceback 
how'd you install pandas  0 24 0 hasn't been pushed anywhere yet 
do you have a particular use case for this 
do you get this if you just use the label instead of  df columns 0   on the left hand side of the expression 
can you double check your install and your script 
maybe we can just dispatch the complex formatting to the  floatarrayformatter   pandas only  somewhat  supports numpy's complex dtypes which are all float based afaict 
does #27972 help on that front  might need to be extended to cover this in particular
can you show the expected output  you're masking a series with a boolean series  so you should get back a series with the true rows 
can you share it by some other means 
do you mind simplifying your example to a minimal set of operations  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you try running this code against  master  https   github com pandas dev pandas commit bb0376c209d97e49b9c94038926ee62ddc0ee84d    i tried it there  and i don't see any noticeable leak 
can your bug report be simplified 
do you have any way of profiling 
can you profile the two using snakeviz and   or line profiler 
can you create a minimal example  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports and fill out the issue template

can you post pd show_versions  i think this raises on master
how did you create the connection   sqlalchemy engine 
can you fill out the issue template with a minimal example  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you give an example of the expected behavior and api parameters 
can you provide a minimal example  and delete the issue template stuff from your post  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you provide self contained code samples to reproduce  unfortunately screenshots are not very helpful
can you check the pr where this was implemented to see if this case was discussed 
can you not use charted or another library for this 
what does it fail with  an importerror  most likely needs an importorskip on html5lib and   or beautiful soup 
can you try on master  looks ok for me 
can you try with a fresh environment  rather than installing into an existing one  conda create  n pandas 1 0 0rc0  c conda forge label rc  c conda forge pandas  1 0 0rc0
could you try it on master branch or 1 00rc   pandas general py  indicates this might be an old version
can you try this with master  pandas 1 0 0rc0   i think this is fixed 
what version of pandas do you use  eventually  released version 0 25 1  can't solve this bug  but  the current development version 1 1 0 dev0+419 g625441b31  has solved this problem  i hope it helps you 
does the original datetime string include year  month  and day information 
does the same error occur if you create a new environment with just pandas 
can you provide a reproducible example  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports
can you check that 
can you import just numpy  can you try out an environment with just conda forge and just defaults packages  rather than a mix 
can you post the full traceback  and investigate where things are going wrong 
can you provide a minimal example  http   matthewrocklin com blog work 2018 02 28 minimal bug reports

how would you transoform it back to an arraycollection or anything that's traversable  it might be that it'd better solved by a custom transformer 
do you use the  processbuilder  or do you build the command line on your own and pass it to the  process  constructor

would it be possible for that specific component to call the logger and tell with  debug  which options _are_ available 
could it be that you've configured trustedproxies in another test and not reset them 
would a parameter meet your need  something like this   or via the  options  
did we missed something in order to understand your issue  
maybe we can use that 
shouldnt you init the custom request type at the root of bootstrapping  thus in the front controller  https   github com symfony recipes blob master symfony framework bundle 4 2 public index php#l36 then everything is ok no 
would you be able to send a pr doing so  branch 3 4 for the first step i suppose 
what would be the resulting php structure  
shouldnt it be prefixed as well  besides  how does it differ from defining it as a binding    does it override a single bound argument at that position 
can you give a more detailed explanation or show some screenshot or something like that demonstrating what you experienced 
does it happen also on 2 6 4 or no  
would you be able to try with 3 4 dev  i think this is fixed already  otherwise  can you provide a reproducer

what version are you running 
could you recreate issue using our  angular package  https   github com highcharts highcharts angular   or at least without this third party package  i see that bug was reported on the package github  https   github com cebor angular highcharts issues 190 but not acknowledged 
can you provide the url to a test page where we can see the problem 
does the community have an opinion on what to expect  perhaps we just need to throw an error in this case 
can you please show us a url and set up exact steps to reproduce 
could it be that you ran this right when we were deploying the new release 
can you show us a demo  i tried this one  http   jsfiddle net highcharts rqn3q   clicked series 1 in the legend to hide it  but it looks ok 
could you reproduce this error on jsfiddle 
can you share more information to make it reproduce 
what system are you running  your second issue is #896  so i'm removing that from this report  only one issue should be reported in each report 
what browser system is this  see http   jsfiddle net highcharts rypuu 1 show   i tested this in chrome  firefox  ie8 and ie9 and the tooltip looks right for all of them 
can you verify that with the latest source code from http   github highcharts com master highcharts js  
can you set up a live demo on jsfiddle 
does it work when you revert to the code as it was prior to that commit 
what did you expect  from what i see the flipflop is working fine  every other tooltip is empty and populated 
does this happen with highcharts 3 0 5  i suspected this issue was fixed some weeks ago  see http   jsfiddle net highcharts luqq8 show  fiddle can be edited in http   jsfiddle net highcharts luqq8  in chrome  
would you expect the polyonal x axis to be drawn on top of the outermost y gridline  or on the ends of the x gridlines  spokes  
do you have live example  like jsfiddle  also  how about our examples  are they have the same issue 
can you see it now when clicking the link above 
would it be a solution to list up the features selected in the custom build file 
why this is wrong  event is set on a series level  and series contains group element  which contains other groups  shapes etc  maybe instead you want  this markergroup element   
what do you think  kacpermadej   if  requiresorting    isnumber x     
do you have a live demo with a chart where you use  getsvg

could you please expand it  or create your own  in order to reproduce the problem  
could you reproduce this in a demo  
can you upload a new one  or preferably add a live demo with reproduction steps 
how often do you add data points  can you set up a script that runs quicker  so that you can replicate the effect within a shorter amount of time 
could you confirm  demo    http   jsfiddle net zu4t2sq8 1  docs    https   developer mozilla org en us docs web svg attribute externalresourcesrequired
could you setup jsfiddle with the issue  some dummy data should be enough for updating  it looks very similar to #2406 issue 
when this fix in release 
why not use the raw text directly  http   jsfiddle net highcharts 2bf9cl7a 2 
maybe you are missing  highcharts more js  file in your project  it works fine  i guess  http   jsfiddle net 11xe37ha 
can you show a live demo of this  you can use http   jsfiddle net highcharts as25s8ga  as a starting point 
can you share with us a live demo  it doen't happen here  http   jsfiddle net gh get jquery 1 7 2 highslide software highcharts com tree master samples highcharts demo waterfall

which device are you using  and could you reproduce a demo that fails 
do you use your own or our default option  export highcharts com   
could you elaborate a bit your use case  it's strange to delay  chart redraw    
do  containersrngpsd  items contain the id  i see you have in code   containersrngpsd i  idcontainer    are these id's the same as  template currentdata   chart_id   maybe you can use it instead of  template currentdata   chart_id  
can you reproduce this live so we can see it 
could you point me out how it should work step by step  it will allow me to understand your goal and then compare with our current options 
do you have an example where it doesn't work  we should obviously also skip hidden series  so i'll quickly add in a check for that 
could you recreate issue in jsfiddle  thanks 
could you recreate the issue in jsfiddle  i assume you are not using categorized xaxis   xaxis categories             
could you simplify your chart's options and setup the live demo 
could you simplify your names for categories  those are really long  for example limit length of a category to  25characters  something like this  https   jsfiddle net blacklabel 09rklqme 2 
could you explain the case a bit more  you mean  you set manually   exporting csv itemdelimiter   https   api highcharts com highcharts exporting csv itemdelimiter  to     and now it can break exported csv's

could you supply me details about your device and os  including full number of version   
maybe you could elaborate on the issue 
which type do you expect instead of any 
could you prepare a gif   screenshot of unworking demo  could you update my jsfiddle with your data and supply some details about os   browser version  
maybe you mean  xaxis reversed   not  yaxis opposite    then yes  i would expect partialfill starting from the right edge of the point 
could you update the demo  https   jsfiddle net blacklabel 5873jtpn  with your code for the further debugging 
could you elaborate the reason of that  when i open the demo  https   jsfiddle net gh get library pure highcharts highcharts tree master samples maps demo map pies  all worked properly 
how it should look like in output 
could you update the example with your simplied chart's options and data  it will allow us to reproduce and debug 
do we have any other similar situations  images    perhaps  chart reflow    should be able to solve it  leaving the decision up to  torsteinhonsi
could you elaborate which size of container allow to reproduce the problem  i tested 300   600   1000px and still have the same amount of ticks in both cases

what would be your use case for this feature 
can you share a simple model that does this  i'll take a look 
does this warrant its own new example  work in progress pr  https   github com mrdoob three js pull 13060
can you please post your desired result  source url  http   127 0 0 1 8000 collada_model file    i  drop_box dropbox projects promotion_ply_projects table table_low_res_maya sourceimages _00_a1shape jpg transformed url  used for loading    
what browser are you using 
maybe  joostfaassen knows what the problem is 
do you mind updating it to r63 
can we just create a new repo for that so that it can be smaller 
maybe try to split into tris before exporting  might help  although i don't see why would it suddenly start rotate along with the model 
what about this line  https   github com mrdoob three js blob master examples js controls transformcontrols js#l899
did you try clicking in the viewport so it has the focus and then using the keys 
how do you think the api should be for it  could you write an example 
can you think of a "real" use case 
why would you call a  traverse    method if you do not want to traverse 
what three js version and loader version are you using 
maybe it would be better to add it to the  russian wikipedia entry  https   ru wikipedia org wiki three js  
do you mind creating a jsfiddle showing that 
what name would you suggest instead 
what's ghost 
could you give it a go 
does this wok 
maybe we can do some sort of  three webgltexture  
can you take a screenshot  i don't see the super blurry display issue here 
do you mind doing a pr for it 
can you please explain your approach  besides  are you aware of  material onbeforecompile    or the reusable character of shader chunks 
why do you think that this is a meaningful test 
how about using  mesh clone    and changing the material 
can you try resizing the texture to 512x512 
could you upload a zip file with the obj and texture somewhere so i can study this 
what do you get when you type  renderer info memory  into the console 
would you try the test again 
maybe #7747 broke this too 
why don't you pass  renderer domelement  to  trackballcontrols  instead 
do you mind sharing some images that illustrate what you're trying to achieve 
why not pr to  this  https   github com mrdoob three js tree master examples js loaders sea3d  
can you demonstrate the warnings with a live example  it seems your linked demo still uses  r101  
maybe we could add custom geometries to  objectloader  so the user could have a callback when one of these are found and build their own custom one 
what things don't you need  geometries maybe 
can you please explain in more detail what you mean  it seems to work fine in the official example  https   threejs org examples webgl_lights_rectarealight
how is it supposed to look

do you mind explaining your use case for converting from  buffergeometry  to  geometry  
what's your use case 
why so many polygons 
maybe we add a  setmtlloader  method to  objloader  so we can bring back the lost functionality 
maybe the loader could just return the images and the example would show ho to place them in 3d planes  how is the volume mesh being generated  marching cubes 
can you provide an example 
do you mean the image is flipped    mirrored in the  horizontal  axis 
can you provide a fiddle to replicate the warning 
do you have the latest drivers installed for your graphics card 
what's your use case  does your project depend on material stencil and  maskpass  
do you have some specific numbers 
who would like to propose a solution that works uniformly throughout the library 
what file are you talking about 
does the error issue still happen with  r79  
does this happen using  videotexture  https   github com mrdoob three js blob master src textures videotexture js  too  http   threejs org examples webgl_video_panorama_equirectangular html
could you create a live link we can check 
do you mind creating a jsfiddle we can work with

do you want to make a pr 
maybe  skinnedmesh   skeleton  building issue  i'll take a look closer      cc  donmccurdy
would you like to do a pull request 
how come you're using jsonloader   instead of objectloader 
can you please test if an additional line of code solves the issue  please add the following line     after this one  https   github com mrdoob three js blob 1cbcaab0b8c80cd66b5812881597529f9ebd19c0 examples js loaders fbxloader js#l1233
can you share the 50mb file 
can you please make necessary corrections to your post and provide further detail 
do you have any solutions 
what happens if you use a more recent version of  three js   besides  does the error occur with firefox on your smartphone 
maybe you should report this to phonegap instead  does it happen when running it as a website with safari 
do you want to make a pr for this  blush  
did you modify the example  also  see #11678 
can you demonstrate the issue with a simple  live example 
can you please post a screenshot with the visual error  i'm unable to reproduce  besides  how would a proper fix would look like from your point of view 
can you upload the  dae  file  please 
can you share a screenshot  also  1 unit   1 meter  100 000 000 meter sounds like a very big space  are you doing a universe simulation or something 
what's your workaround btw 
do you have an idea how we can handle nodes without  id  attribute  could the loader generate add this missing information in some way 
maybe a better fix is to change this  line  https   github com mrdoob three js blob dev examples js loaders colladaloader js#l2754  to the following   can you please check if this also solves your problem 
does maya have something similar    fxb  https   user images githubusercontent com 5307958 31367118 53edc45a ad9f 11e7 9dba 58d265e542ad jpg 
does http   webglreport com  say something's off 
how about exporting to fbx instead 
can you share the model  i'll take a look  you can add zip files here 
would you like to do a pr with the fix 
why are you setting  material morphtargets   true  when the geometry does not have morph targets defined 
how about just link to the webgl reference card  last 2 pages cover all of glsl https   www khronos org files webgl webgl reference card 1_0 pdf unlike the list above they also tersely document what most of them do
can you provide any details  it looks like it is using multiple materials have you tried to isolate the offending material 
maybe it's time we made some more noise over there 
do you have the same problem with  r90   latest version   besides  is the following example rendered correctly on your ios devices  https   threejs org examples webgl_materials_variations_phong html
can you share the model you are having problems with 
would you like to correct the description  😊
maybe we can enhance  webgluniforms  in order to implement a similar caching system  btw  i think it would be useful if  webglinfo  could count uniform updates changes per frame 
do you mean this tool  https   github com madskristensen bundlerminifier i guess it makes more sense to file a bug at the project's repo  this is not a  three js  related issue 
can you please have a look 
could you include the   blend  file  as well 
why do you feel you need to clone a  camerahelper  
can you please show your code  btw  have you scene these changes  https   github com mrdoob three js commit cfd22c2c4f4621d770f3a5af68b0533e69af5959#diff eb152a516883cb17690e595058479f49 i guess this pr also affects your application

can you please test in your side  too 
what browser platform are you seeing this in   webxr and #15393 should be chrome on android only 
can you also make a test with firefox 
do you mean calling  material dispose    does not free all related resources  might be related to #12464 
can you provide a test case we can use to reproduce the issue 
can you please try to use png textures instead of tga 
would you like to do a pr with the change 
do you mind reporting it to mozilla instead 
what do you expect here from the  three js  project 
do you wanna make a pr with the fix 
did this broke after updating firefox  after updating three      
maybe it's worth supporting that  too  maybe  material stencilfrontwritemask  and  material stencilbackwritemask  
maybe a corrupt gpu driver  does it also happen with firefox  what version of windows and what gpu are you using

would you still be willing to make a pr 
do you know if the winding order of the holes is opposite that of the shape 
can you work with another 3d format like  ply  or even  gltf   both should handle vertex colors more robust 
does this only happen in the yandex browser  not in chrome  please create a playground example http   www qooxdoo org devel playground  which shows the problem preferably in current chrome 
can the name be a little longer  like euler or e_euler  i would like to avoid issues like #1735
can you add a condition to build xml that sets   platform  to linux32 when armv7h is detected

does that help 
can you please check if this is still an issue for you on master 
how is code quality maintained

can't seem to reproduce  could you please provide a test case for it 
what version are you using 
what version did you test against  i'll look into this  but most likely a lingo issue again 
what version are you using   although this shouldn't matter for a case where you dont use  as  
should work  what version are you on  i would suggest doing this though 
what exactly are you attempting to do  can you show us your setup and what columns on what associations you are trying to aggregate

could you provide some code  model definitions  associations and find call with include please    
what version are you on 
what version are you working with  jasontheadams  afaik hasmany only creates constraints by default on the 2 0 0dev versions  but you can use  hasmany model   ondelete  'cascade'    on 1 7 i believe 
can you give some more information please  which version are you on  which dialect are you using  can you show some code that reproduces the error  
does the problem happen if you've specifically defined the includes 
which version is this on  i believe i've fixed something like this pretty recently
which version are you experiencing this with  we have some code to handle this  but it might not cover all cases
do you have reverse associations for the belongsto  they might be interfering

how are you checking the value in the database   gui vs cli 
which error message 
can you ping me when the new version is released

why is this strange   build  only creates a javascript instance  not an actual row in the db  when you call  setrelation   the instance is saved
what is specifically required from sequelize side  you can call them using  sequelize fn  
do you have  pg native  installed too 
what are you passing as  options   are you using a transaction 
can you give a more concrete example of a case where you think the alias should be "inherited"

can you post what sql query sequelize should have produced instead 
can you provide a  mcve  https   stackoverflow com help minimal reproducible example  to reproduce this error  thanks 
can you explain more your question  how would you do it via  queryinterface  
can you post a code that i can copy paste and execute immediately  without further preparation  except for installing sequelize itself  
can you please open a new issue showing with a sscce an example of this happening 
what do you think 
do you have any suggestion on how sequelize should handle this  should sequelize remove the foreign key constraint before deleting

what platform are you on 
could you please check what your  np __version__  is  this seems most likely already fixed 
what numpy version are you using 
can you create a pull request fixing the issue 
can you show the full build log 
what is  min       we can define  sum      as  0  easily  but   inf   +inf  for min max does not seem elegant clear to be correct  so we raise an error instead at the moment 
where does your numpy come from 
would you like to submit this as a pr 
how did you install python  how did you install numpy 
can i try to implement this function as my first contribution 
did you build numpy yourself  i'll guess a cython problem  but need to know more  what distro  what os 
maybe this is what is meant by 'usable' in 'the smallest  in magnitude  usable floating value' 
what platform are you on 
what version of numpy 
what version of numpy are you using 
which os are you using 
can we really afford a fourth 1 14 x release 
could you give more information about the machines compilers where it is not present 
can you elaborate please  from my perspective the overflow happening here is totally logical 
what platform are you running on  i get an out of memory error with this and 16g memory 
do you need to activate your conda environment 
could you share some sample code causing the error  i think the best we can hope for here is to convey a more understandable error message

what numpy version 
maybe setting  npy_lapack_order atlas openblas mkl  or similar can help you  i am not sure that one made it into the release notes  see also gh 13132
what do you mean  this doesn't work when n   1 either   np linalg inv  1  2  3   
what's the issue 
can you elaborate on what this test is doing  can you produce a testcase that causes it without importing tensorflow 
how and where did you install numpy 
what exactly are you doing and what python version

would you care to submit a patch to make  nganimate  a bit more careful  also a similar bug may appear in the core  ng  package too
could you provide more info like a real life use case  example syntax etc   as it stands right now it is not actionable  really 
would you like to submit a pr for this 
do you mean like defined as a route that would match a given path  if so the answer is no

however  why don't you want the model to be created implicitly in the first place 
can you please provide a reproduction in a plunker or similar

what does the html for that look like  can you post a minimal demo  ideally on plnkr co or similar

can you please test with the latest 1 3 20  or even better 1 4 9  1 3 x only gets critical fixes

do you have the most recent version 
why did you tell nginx to listen on port 9000 
does hhvm have permissions to write on that folder 
can you try a nightly build  i can't repro this locally on a recent master build  and so i strongly suspect it will be fixed in 3 9 
could you run the debug build and get us a stacktrace and possibly a core dump 
what happens when you try that  are you sure you specified those settings correctly   it should be complaining about a different number of bytes at least  
can you try deleting   var run hhvm hhvm hhbc  and see what happens 
how is this handled in zend 
could you see if you can repro using master 
can you repro with a debug build  maybe attach a debugger and see what the first fault is if this is consistent 
did that ever happen 
does this reproduce on the nightlies and or building from master 
does this code work in php 
which line is it crashes on  does it work in normal php 
shouldn't this be filed with the intellij team or possibly done by the community 
what is  g++   version  
what is g++   version 
can you please supply a small test case that executes differently between php5 and hhvm  that will help a lot with us fixing it faster 
should everything you put in  fastcgi_param  appear in   _server   should custom headers sent by the client appear there 
can you send us a pr please 
how are you setting it  none of these have the   tmp perf pid map  created     hhvm  veval perfpidmap 0 test php     hhvm  veval perfpidmap false test php     hhvm  veval perfpidmap no test php     hhvm  veval perfpidmap  test php 
can you share instructions  and simple code if possible  for how to reproduce it 
did you get this during runtime or build time 
does your script work under php fpm 
did you compile it yourself  used any of our packages    
can you get a c++ stack trace 
can you write a self contained script that reproduces this crash 
can you show one please  in any case  i think we should file a bug against php5 instead 
why not work off nfs  so rather than mounting the windows folder inside virtualbox  mount the virtualbox folder inside of windows 
what version of hhvm are you running currently 
can you highlight the line that is causing the error 
maybe we are passing that option to c++ files but not asm ones  but then it's unclear why  as needed  would fix it 
do you have a counterargument  do any languages other than java implement them   i'm not aware of any  which if true  and not just my ignorance  is pretty damning  
could this be done as a shape 
which version of hhvm  this doesn't happen to me on the latest nightly  which as of writing this is  heads master 0 g1ea69d060994735d7fec9e364d083f72fc900144   
does  telnet localhost 9000  give you connection refused 
does owncloud have phpunit tests 
can you show us some code that reproduces this behaviour 
can you paste your configuration files

can you come up with a short isolated example of the crash 
what is the output of the following command   lsb_release  a   uname  a   cat  etc issue   cat  etc apt sources list   cat  etc apt sources list d   
what os are you on 
which piece of code needed the ldap headers 
can you try to build glog using gcc 4 9 or recompile it with the   d_glibcxx_use_cxx11_abi 0  option using gcc 5 2 
does it choke with base64_decode as well 
maybe add this custom command https   github com facebook hhvm blob master hphp runtime cmakelists txt#l31 to  hphp runtime ext_zend_compat cmakelists txt  
does this affect magento 
how are you testing  you are sure the jit is on and the jit is warmed up 
does hacktest rely on that version of difflib 
what is the script you are trying to run 
can you provide your  composer json  and distro version so that it is possible to reproduce exactly the same test case 
which version of gcc are you using  this is a bug in gcc  not hhvm or mcrouter 
do you have a copy of your error log  specifically does it have anything mentioning
however  which clients do u expect to use websocket 7  i'm not sure there are that many  from http   en wikipedia org wiki websocket#browser_support  only ff6 supports it 
could you give me some more insight into this  
do you get the same issue under different browsers 
could you please include the stacktrace  
shouldn't it be this way    
do we also split them from the core transport 
could you paste your settings xml 
what do you think 
could you please tell us how to reproduce it exactly by ourselves 
what exactly is the problem   any exception etc  
can you verify this  
can you share the heap dump

what os are you running 
could you post the complete traffic of the connection that triggered the problem 
could you let us know why you specified an alternative  delegatedtaskexecutor  
maybe inserting something in the documentation could be useful to resolve this issue 
can you give more details  
could you try at least 3 7 0 final or 3 8 0 final snapshot to see if the problem is gone already 
can you give more details  
can you provide a unit test that show what is wrong  
could you come up with a pr  
what "prs" does mean 
can you clarify your environment and the error a bit more  for example  mvn   veresion  and the file name would be helpful  thanks 
could you please try again with the latest snapshot build 
would you be interested in sending us a pr 
do you have any interest in submitting a pr to resolve this issue  we love prs   
what about taking a heap dump  
can you also test with 4 1 0 beta6 snapshot just to be sure it is not fixed already  
would you mind trying this pr 
why does netty not follow semantic versioning  most developers expect compatibility between minor version changes 
will check    any special setting 
can you explain why  copy    is preferred over  slice    due to the objects returned by  slice    not being pooled 
could you share a reproducer  also i'm understanding it correctly that with nounsafe it runs faster 
why would tcp not deliver these packets in order 
maybe  mvn clean install  dskiptests   
could you try 4 1 0 cr7 and see if the bug is still there 
however if there is a concrete use case that cannot easily be accomplished other ways then perhaps its better to make  nio  and  epoll  consistent      normanmaurer   wdyt 
can you guys point me to the code where they bootstrap the server  
maybe you should review how you send http request to the server  hope this helps 
maybe something bad with your setup  
why you want it to be a  bytebuf   
does this help  
do you have thoughts   opinions here 
what you means with "collapse"   the error you see here is that it basically can not connect to the remote host as it refused the connection attempt 
why are you using so many threads 
what threading and thread count are you using  i have had some issues that match your numbers when using 1 boss thread only  every 3rd connection would not complete 
can you please provide a reproducer  what transport type are you using  nio  epoll  kqueue   what network transport type are you using  tcp  udp  etc

how does it cause unnecessary memory overhead when it is a static field 
how are you planning to implement those metrics counter into netty  during server bootstrapping or some different approach 
what is your jdk version 
maybe you need to shutdown listening channels as well 
what  more information 
could you dump the entity diffs from a  unitofwork   can you reproduce this in a test case scenario 
what sequence of queries did you expect 
do you really need to load all those objects  can't you just use sql 
did you run schema validation on this  can you turn it into a reproducible test case to be added to https   github com doctrine doctrine2 tree master tests doctrine tests orm functional ticket  
do you expect proxy objects with only the id set 
do you need the data from the other table  or is it just to filter the rows from the original table 
can you provide a stack trace  please 
can you make this an isolated test case 
can you please check  doctrine commons  version  as mentioned on https   github com doctrine doctrine2 issues 6203#issuecomment 269640869 and https   github com doctrine doctrine2 issues 6188#issuecomment 268538517  
what do you mean by "use" here  what is the   entity  getclassname    call 
maybe this should be a joined table inheritance 
did the results change  what db adapter are you using 
what's the trace for that exception  can this be reproduced in a test case 
do you like to create a pr for that 
could you please run  composer why not doctrine instantiator 1 0 1  and post the output here 
did you write the query yourself  the subquery is probably returning more than one result 
what would the proper sql query look like  what would it look like for a complex condition  such as a jti sti 
what is being passed to  entitymanager#getrepository    
why not simply create associations to child entities  rather than to the root of the inheritance  filtering by type can be done via dql and the  instance of  expression 
what's the generated dql string for that query builder 
what about  findby  'potatoes'           closing as  invalid  
can you provide a test case  i really didn't understand the issue from your description 
shouldn't  max  be an  aggregateexpression   
why is it a problem to have 20 database fields for 10 value objects  i mean the number of columns is hardly limited  4096 in case for mysql  
can you maybe try exposing your exact scenario in a test case such as in https   github com doctrine doctrine2 tree 1760b4f655b83d391f3ada5dca587970d915ecb3 tests doctrine tests orm functional ticket  
can it be reproduced without symfony  since the test case seems to deny that   maybe this is related to query logging 
can you try reproducing the bug in a dql test to be added to https   github com doctrine doctrine2 blob 7b261676d2356cb5ff0287e13fea331d463ac67a tests doctrine tests orm query selectsqlgenerationtest php please 
could you reduce the code example a bit  i'm not sure if i understand the issue  is the association being overwritten by lazy loading 
can you please put the mentioned annotation s  in doctrine annotations#275 too 
do you have a chance to check if this also applies to  master  
do you have a suggestion on how where to introduce a fix for this 
how the orm behaves when you invert your mapping 
maybe it's a matter of adapting its code 
does that help  i hope bisect returns good results 
does a repeat query pass if you do a different query between them 
why 1024 x 768 where it takes from  maybe it can be reassign or run special x server for it 
do you mean that this line   shows  referenceerror  bla bla' 
why is this closed  this still affects 1 9

why  ios  
how to differentiate between them 
does template html work okay for you  or is the problem just with slide shows you produce using pandoc 
why aren't you using  equation   for inline  and   equation   for not inline math 
why don't you report it to the bibutils maintainer  note  i'm working on a direct bibtex    pandoc citeproc yaml converter that will properly handle all such cases 
can you try the latest release   there's a windows package  
do you see a better solution 
why don't you use yaml 
why not just output to latex format    t latex  o file tex  should do what you want 
what did you try  here's a  one column simple table  http   johnmacfarlane net pandoc try  text          0aone 0a         0acolumn 0a         0a 0a from markdown to html   here's  another one  http   johnmacfarlane net pandoc try  text          0acolumn 0a         0a 0a from markdown to html  
should pandoc be parsing markdown here 
can you link to somewhere this format is documented 
does this apply to epub2 only  or also epub3 
can you describe the shortcomings of doing this if you have 
what kind of support do you envisage 
did you try with   s  
can you compile normal  tex  documents 
would you mind posting the contents of  ex bib  
how does multimarkdown handle this  i wonder 
what version of pandoc are you using  can you post the result of converting the document to  latex     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1216657 6789204 8f58993a d196 11e4 88df 48caec679a8f png 
could you please try with the latest from there  if possible 
can you try in the newest pandoc version please 
what version of pandoc are you using  recent versions allow indefinitely many parameters    pandoc  t latex  mylatexcmd a  b  c   d  mylatexcmd a  b  c  so you probably just need to upgrade 
can you elaborate  by the way  if you don't want any warnings  just use   quiet 
what do you mean "does not work"  produces the correct aspect ratio slides for me with pandoc 2 3
how did you produce the reference docx  the recommended way is to produce a docx using pandoc  then modify it 
canvas actually draws it  right  it doesn't just embed an image  i'll investigate it further  but it doesn't look like something we'll be able to deal with anytime soon 
should  according to what  see the documentation for the  auto_identifiers  extension 
do you get the same error as before 
can you link to or send an epub that causes the issue 
can you open the files in question in word or open libre office  can you post a link to them 
does using    latex engine xelatex  help 
what version of pandoc are you using   you can unzip the epub and look at the html pages to see if it's a conversion problem or an ibooks problem  
can someone else who uses pandoc on windows try to confirm this  i don't have a windows setup handy 
what pandoc version are you using 
what if you have a code block containing a literal    pre   tag  how would you handle that 
does this have something to do with pandoc  if so  how are you running pandoc  what is the input  etc  
could you attach such a minimal odt please 
what do you mean with "quadratic table" and more importantly how does this relate to pandoc 
can you move this to jgm pandoc citeproc  it's not an issue in pandoc itself 
what exactly are the commands you're using  you might not need pandoc citeproc etc   what i do  git clone https   github com jgm pandoc cd pandoc stack setup # only first time stack install
what exactly should be emitted instead of   newcommand  textlatin  2     foreignlanguage latin  #2      the relevant code is https   github com jgm pandoc blob master src text pandoc writers latex hs#l1381
what ghc and stack versions 
what would be the best output  lists aren't part of the pandoc ast  i guess  look for a "body copy" field  and default to the first item in the list 
would you have looked for something in the manual before making this report 
what's your pandoc version 
do you have a suggested fix for the template  or alternatively  what's the expected output of  pandoc  t beamer https   raw githubusercontent com pacien pandoc beamer metropolis standout bug master test md
can you check again  also try with   verbose and look at the latex intermediate  to make sure it contains   hl highlight this text    
how big  mb  are the files you're trying to convert  what format  markdown  if any are publicly available  it would be helpful for us to test 
could you perhaps test the template in the pull request 
what real world cases do you have in mind where you'd want pandoc to process empty input 
can anyone help test with the revisions of the default template suggested above 
can you expand the latex side of things to be a full mwe 
did you check the end of your document  following groff custom  we added the  tc macro to the end  not the beginning  perhaps we could change that 
what version are you using 
could you post expected input and output 
can you post the new docx file that gave this markdown output  looks like it might be a bug in the docx reader 
did you do that  it isn't enough to select the headings in the sample doc and change their color to black 
can you say more about how and why you're cross compiling pandoc 
would you recommend making the url a static variable which needs to be set in a config file 
do you have a screenshot  and what pod are you on 
what error do you get in your logs 
what are "search tag options" 
what's the content of the xss request return 
what do you mean by "attempts"  i had this issue and deleted gemfile lock  ran bundle install again  there are a lot of windoze probs though  
did you seed the database with rake  also make sure you are running the bundle and rake commands with sudo  perhaps it is an issue with 64 bit 
what appserver are you running 
how about  that  https   diasp org p 130969  
what browser os are you on 
could you elaborate  we sort posts by recently commented on by default  this may cause some confusion    
can you post a link to a public post where this happens  otherwise it will be very difficult for us to track it down 
what browser os are you using 
maybe the same issue like #3153  
how do you imagine this to be realized 
couldn't be that you were trying to mention someone that isn't included in the aspect you were posting to 
what database and version are you using  looks like it may be an issue with the way the date function works 
can anyone else confirm and close 
can you provide specific steps to reproduce 
do you want to do it  
can you post a screenshot so we can tell what you're referring to  thanks 
can anyone else confirm in the listed browsers 
what url are you trying to share 
why closing  locking  content to d   only 
can you give us more information about how this happens  what os are you on  does it work on other browsers 
does this problem happen if you try on a different computer  it could be related to what time javascript thinks it is on your browser  looking into it more now 
which pod are you using  and which browser 
can you point me at a public post where you see this problem 
can you quickly sum up what data is expected to be in that tag 
did you try the  db "mysql" bundle exec rake assets precompile or db "postgresql" bundle exec rake assets precompile to build assets 
can you please try if it works with the vanilla gemfile after running  rm  rf  bundle  with  db postgres bundle install   without heroku development test  
did you restart after you set it 
can you find out who the user is you should see the image of      for some reason the profile seems not to be in the database
do we have some rules who you should be allowed to mention 
should the "page" be able to comment on  third party  posts  many open questions 
what version of ruby are you running  by the way 
which pod are you on  which version of the code is it running 
does it work ok when using other locales  languages  in firefox win 7  particularly  is it ok for other right to left scripts  e g  arabic  
can you check directly in the database what's in the  hidden_shareables  column in the  users  table for this user  you can probably fix it by resetting this to  null  
why did you need to request this permission  did you follow  this guide  https   wiki diasporafoundation org integrating_other_social_networks#facebook   afaik there should be no permissions requested 
what's your pod 
do you have exact steps that reliably reproduce  any errors in your browsers error console  if you watch your browsers network console  what's the request and its return code 
can you please check the js console in chrome browser  do you have anything related in the diaspora logs in  logs  you can try to grep "completed 500" for example 
maybe use the admin account specified in 'diaspora yml' and ignore the 'welcome_sendmsg' flag if no admin account is specified 
can't we just proxy them through our configuration system 
what are you talking about 
which pods are involved 
what  what issues do you have  what do you need to reload  do you get any error messages 
did you post it in "public"  "all aspects" or the "fun" aspect 
could you look through your  log production log  or  log development log  respectively for the error 
what would be the benefit of this over pressing the relevant buttons 
can you please describe the exact steps you are following explaining what happens and what is expected   without using the dandelion app    thank you 
does rgui rmenu having this option now suit your needs 
can you compile from source and confirm if the issue is fixed now  i pushed a fix that should take care of this some days ago 
can you re test on a current nightly 
should be fixed in 32a5c1a  can you confirm 
what games  give some crc values 
can you bisect this 
how could this possibly be done reliably on desktop oses  non hard realtime  where scheduling latency is random 
does this happen on desktop too 
why are wiimotes special in this regard  adding a separate input driver  with a dependency  just for a single device is stupid

would you happen to have  or can you make  a reduced test case on jsfiddle or similar website 
what browsers are you seeing this in 
what version of videojs are you using  but you're correct  our docs don't reflect that you can make them an array 
would you be able to put the example on a site like jsfiddle net

how do you get the rtmp link 
do you have a reduced test case

what's  f  in the first line  i know what it's _supposed_ to be  but i'm wondering where it's set above this snippet  and what type of object it actually is 
can you provide a patch or a test case 
did you recently upgrade to formtastic 1 2  how are you loading in formtastic  gem  git source  
could you submit a failure spec or the fix 
could you check with master branch of formtastic too 
could you provide me with a stripped back html only test case that i can wire up to formtastic css to repeat 
can you please advise your rails version  confirm you're using rails 1 2 4 and confirm that you restarted your server and all those basic things after upgrading to 1 2 4 
could you check with formtastic 2 0 0 rc3 
could you send a pull request with a failing spec 
what are you doing so far in the view  what version of formtastic 
can you give me an example where this is the case    where you need to implement your own wrapper  or to not have one at all 
did you try it  it should work  if it doesn't that's a bug  and i'd love to see a patch pull request 
what previous version of formtastic did this work for you  this will help me narrow down the change and understand it 
can you get specific about your use case 
can you provide more detail and an example please 
can i get your help to at least test out my hypothesis 
what do you mean by "cannot load" 
do you mind creating a sample repo reproducing the case  it looks quite complex and it would allow us to make a test case for it 
how you want to present it to the user  string input like  one  two  three    or checkboxes  formtastic provides input types for collections  see the readme 
what version of the library you are using 
would your code work in ie6 
could you be i little more precise in what you are trying to do  read the readme of the repo too to follow a bit the guidelines for issues  thanks

did you encounter any issue with this simplistic approach 
does fitnesse work as expected otherwise  does the test pass using an earlier release   i did run that test on macos before making the release and it was green  
can i see the full trace  pass   t  to rake

do you need to be able to do such a workaround if the original issue is fixed 
maybe the default should be shorter 
why not keep using the witness plugin for that verification part 
did you fix this in your publishing plugin 
could you check if there is some bug regarding the problem you are describing for the zinc compiler  can you maybe even reproduce the problem when using sbt 
can you confirm that the issue already occurs with gradle 4 0 
would you be interested in contributing a fix 
which url on which documentation is broken  that would be great 
would you be interested in providing a pull request for the first two issues 
can you please provide a reproducible example project 
do you mean that when you put   provided resolutionstrategy cachedynamicversionsfor 0  timeunit seconds    and other lines  in the build gradle things work from buildship 
do you have a reproducible example  does it work in 4 7 
what are your reasons to delete the build cache directory on a clean build 
what happens if you force the tool you're invoking to use its "rich" output and gradle's running with    console plain   is the output mixed 
would that be a good solution for you 
could you give the 4 9 nightly a try  a lot has changed in that area  including some bugfixes  those might have addressed this as well 
what part of that advice is incorrect  was that not enough  what does  eol lf  do 
could you confirm this is what you are after  else we would need more details of what feature you are requesting 
does deleting the   gradle  directory in the project dir help 
what kind of time are you expecting 
why are you doing this 
would you be interested in submitting a pr 
can you run   gradle dependencyinsight   configuration testruntimeclasspath   dependency httpclient    i think you just forgot to add the repositories 
what makes you think gradle 5 is responsible here  does it work _without_ gradle 
what is your particular use case you are trying to solve when using a  map string  file    what does the input represent 
could you try in groovy dsl  i don't see why it wouldn't work without the taskprovider#get 
could you expand on the use case these hooks solve  the issue with such hooks is the inability to cache or compute the up to date check 
could you open a new issue about this 
can you please add a readme to the reproducer that shows what works 
why not use the build cache  which is designed exactly for this use case 
can you add an example how you select your directories and where you see the desired undesired files 
could you describe what you are trying to achieve  this would allow to see if what's already available or the in progress things would fulfill that use case 
when it hangs like this  if you kill the  gradleworkermain  process  does the build complete with any other information 
did this work for some other version of gradle  but the same version of groovy  
does https   docs gradle org nightly userguide modeling_features html#cross project publications help 
wouldn't  getclassdisplayname  be ecosystem specific  some ecosystems don't have the concept of class 
do you have anything in    gradle init d  could you run the gradle build scan quickstart build with    scan  and provide the build scan link 
do you really intend to publish  snapshot  and  release  during the same build  what is the purpose of having multiple publications 
does this still happen in latest head 
do you have any other stacks which show what process might be holding it 
would you elaborate on how you envision this being done 
what filesystem are you using on the destination  are you sure the source file isn't sparse   you can check that using du on the source file 
what version of the spl zfs were you using 
can you share result of  powertop   csv   
does your code have a5c20e2a0a9046c06d86615fbf51dc04f12bba14  if so  can you try without it  with and without  ashift 12   please 
does it work correctly for primary pool  log  and cache vdevs 
would it be possible to post the spl log file online for analysis 
which version of zfs was this 
can you reproduce the panic with the latest master source  there have been a number of snapshot related fixes since 0 6 0 rc13 
did you reimport the pool  or remount the filesystems  after setting the atime property 
would you paste the config log from spl 
did you change your kernel configuration at all before rebuilding 
can you reproduce the issue in a vm   can you remove  quiet  from your kernel line an show us your ouput  perhaps use a netconsole   https   wiki archlinux org index php netconsole  
what crashes   what linux distribution is being used  
can you pull git head and try again  this might be something fixed with f763c3d1df569a8d6b60bcb5e95cf07aa7a189e6
should it  is there supposed to be a "offline" in one of these 
why do you need to do this 
does everything work properly for a clean shutdown 
could you propose a patch for this  i'm happy to review it 
does  zpool status  show any checksum errrors 
can you successfully export zfs via ipv6 is you do it the usual way in linux and _not_ via the sharenfs property 
could it be related to https   github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs issues 108   i'm not really sure what you're proposing  so could you create a pull request against https   github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs   tag 'snapshot debian wheezy 0 6 3 0 15_e2282e_wheezy' which is the latest  
what does dmesg say 
does this case work as expected there 
what does a simple  zpool import  without extra arguments show for available pools  this will case it to inspect all the devices under  dev  looking for pools 
do you also have  xattr sa  
what kind of test makes you think it's not supported  the notify stuff should be handled in the vfs layer  so you should be able to use it on zfs 
could you try compiling your spl and zfs modules with    enable debug   that might cause one of the asserts to be tripped 
what distribution   thanks
which patches are you running 
can you supply the output of "blkid"  linux  or "diskutil list"  os x   please 
do you know exactly which patch caused this 
can you recommend a representative distribution which has an ec2 ami which is actively maintained 
where would be the best place to clone such a kernel from 
do you have any more specific info about the workload or steps to reproduce 
what is the origin property of the  alleged  clone 
can you show us some more information    zpool status   cat  proc mounts  and so on    
where did you find the part that said it was fixed  in 0 6 4  
do you believe this is a new issue with  rc2 
what is your goal for this project 
can you do strace to see what exactly it's doing 
where are you seeing it 
did you try to add   d  dev   to  zpool import   it's sometimes necesary for unknown reasons 
did you use the dataset as nfs datastore  if it is can you restart nfs mountd service and try again 
do we also need this step  3  uncomment the nvram line in  etc libvirt qemu conf 
what version of zfs  what kernel are you compiling it against  and what did you give to    configure   
do you use ssse3 for byteswap variant only 
what does  zpool list  say   do you use many snapshots  
could you perhaps also provide the output of  zpool list vault_0  and  zfs get compressratio vault_0  
does is still fail if you leave off the send  e option  what does  zfs send  le tank zroot znap_2017 07 12 2100_daily   zstreamdump  v  output 
does this still happen on 0 8 0 rc3  there were a few recent commits in this area  including #8172 and #8249
does this happen every time you try to create an encrypted dataset  is the pool encrypted  are you running a lot of  zfs  commands in parallel or something 
did you test different controllers and or cables  checksum error with good drives  thats assuming they are actually good  are often caused by controller or cable issues 
would it be possible to try this on 0 7 8  0 6 5 11 is rather dated and a multitude of updates have occurred since it was released 
what does stat say on  tank  hopefully after trying a newer version 
do you have a console dump to see what's holding up the boot  it could be something systemd related 
maybe you're hitting some unknown suboptimal behavior due to having so many storage pools 
can you share what led you to use the  zpool add  command rather than the  zpool replace  command 
which one are you using  which commit  
can you clarify this moment  and please show  cat  sys module zfs version 
does setting it to  false  help you 
what is this  purge  function  i've ever heard of it
would you be able to post a  runnable  stripped down demonstration of the bug  http   fullcalendar io wiki reduced test cases    would really appreciate it because the time saved reproducing will be time spent fixing 
why  it's a javascript lib  not php 
what do you mean fullcalendar looks for it  it is somehow dependent on how your calling js operates  or your script tags in your html file 
can you further isolate the problem in the jsbin  make the code smaller    1  remove the datepicker 2  remove the custom "agendaall" view

can you repost 
can we see it  i don't understand why it is showing the username in the bookmarks 
can you maybe add a few more posts and see if you can search then 
can you tell me what your server environment is  this in particular is very dependant on your web server 
can you provide a sample image url  or the url to a forum where this is happening 
can you give the steps to reproduce this  i don't quite understand 
can you give us more information about your setup  hosting company  etc 
what admin checkboxes are we talking about here 
how did they register 
do you maybe have a browser plugin that is messing up your page

what version are you using 
could we get a pull request with a quick test to make sure fixing it doesn't break the style of those pages 
how would you propose a php application install a cron  and how will that work on windows 
what version of vanilla are you using 
how could we reproduce this issue 
what should it compile to  what if you add a colon after   x   so   x    
what are you expecting to have happen 
can you provide more examples like the first one 
can you list any use cases     a  looks particularly useless  and is ambiguous with     a    
what browser are you having the issue in  have you tried clearing your cache and refreshing the page 
how many times is this question going to be asked  perhaps 1 5 1 should be hurried out with a fix 
can you give an example of the command you're running or function you're calling 
could you rustle something up  also  do you have a proposal for what the coffeescript syntax could look like 
does this achieve what you're asking for    a  x  b  y    myp1  myobj p1 this assigns  myobj p1  to  myp1   then deconstructs it into  x  and  y  
can you either fix the formatting or put a minimal example of the problem on gist github com 
what exactly are you trying to accomplish here   super    followed by a property access doesn't really make much sense  at least not without the missing class  b   
could you elaborate on what you mean by "module" 
how do the names conflict  aren't they only referenced within the local closure  are you talking about  constructor name  returning the same string for the two different classes 
what javascript environment are you running in  and what error are you getting 
how would  but  differ from  and   precedence 
what version of node and coffeescript are you using  what is the output from running  bin cake test  in the root of your clone of the coffeescript repo 
why would one care about the number of spaces 
would you like this behavior to be changed in some way 
what about   
what's your desired output 
why  does it achieve something beyond the use of the  test  method 
what is the actual problem you are experiencing 
maybe you're looking for  of  
why would you expect a bind helper  it's not being used 
how am i supposed to know the plain old js equivalent if i don't know the semantics associated with the syntax you provided 
would you expect to have to escape  a'b  in a heredoc string  that seems obvious to me  if we're modifying the delimiter  we don't have to escape others 
can backticked comments be used as a workaround 
would you kindly provide your source code 
what's your use case 
why not update coffeelint then 
does the same code work when compiled by babel 
why are you using  cake install  rather than  npm install  g coffee script  to start with  
didn't we already have a ticket for this 
how does it work 
what are you using  use uglifyjs or esmangle  also  this should be on the mailing list  not an issue 
how do you implement that efficiently anyway 
what does that mean  use a      operator to define a function  that's taken already 
what would you have the desired behavior be  every subclass is responsible for method binding 
can you please link to documentation about this syntax 
what version of coffeescript are you using 
why is this better 
can you please post some example code that broke as a result of that change 
did anything change regarding that in node 12 
can you try with the  ast  branch and use a proper ast rather than the call to  nodes  
what does this patch do  and why should it be included in redis 
what is the full error given  if there is a failing assert or alike   thanks 
how about using zinterstore  zunionstore   zinterstore   list that you want it's implement client side  i think that implement server side in a similar way 
do you have perhaps a way to simply replicate it  thanks 
what elements are inside  with what score ranges  and so forth  thanks 
what you are experiencing is very strange and is well covered by the test  is the test passing  thanks

which version are you using  i tested with the compilation of the latest source  it works 
what if filtering out overlapped subscribes before sending sub command to redis server 
does it work when executing manually    var redis notify sh  echo      
could you see "hash" data type 
can you paste the output of redis server  if it crashed it logged it 
does this make sense to you now 
how much memory does your server has  how much memory are these 40+ million keys taking 
can you describe your problem a little bit more  it's not clear what happens and what should happen  the log says nothing and the memory usage looks normal too
what system  what compiler 
what version of redis are you running 
what should it store 
did you tried  make distclean  before to compile 
what command did you run  the processinlinebuffer tells me the when args is null if  argv    null    addreplyerror c "protocol error  unbalanced quotes in request"   setprotocolerror c 0   return c_err   
maybe  therealbill may have an opinion about that 
can you paste the output of  info all  
why not disable the elapsed time printing in that mode

how did you install it 
can you please guide me 
what value does any of your sentinels report when sending the command  sentinel masters  
did you actually set the umask in the shell before starting redis 
what's wrong with the above solution 
what error do you get  what client do you use  can you provide sample code 
do you have other stack traces of the same bug  any idea about the amount of keys in the slave  i'll investigate the bug soon and report back 
does this makes sense according to what you are seeing  unfortunately as hard as jemalloc tries to avoid fragmentation  certain workloads have fragmentation anyway 
do you think just applying a pattern on the certificate subject dn would be sufficient 
can you elaborate on what exactly the problematic scenario 
which key space notifications would you like to be pushed to streams 
could you share the sequence of commands you're using  or a simple script to try 
do you have sentinel pod placed in k8s and configured right  redis's failover funciton is based on sentinel 
can you attach your   aof  
can you list the elements in you list 
maybe you may want to route this internally  thank you 
can you give the redis version  master config and master log 
what is left to support "project settings"  do you have a patch

what result backend are you using  can you see the task being executed in the worker log 
could you try using a simple task like 'tasks add' and give me instructions on how to reproduce from there 
did you close it because you fixed it  if so what did you do  thanks 
does it happen with only mingle  these are new components and is in development  how do you think it should handle them 
could you open a pull request for this 
does it happen consistently  if so how long does it happen after starting the worker

maybe someone is injecting those headers improperly 
which devise version  which rails 3  the gem or from source  how have you installed devise 
what  rake middleware  returns to you  maybe the warden middleware is being inserted too early 
can you please create a smaller application where i can reproduce the error 
what is the backtrace  which orm 
can you please try to isolate in a smaller application and push it to github 
can you isolate this in a smaller application  it seems to be unrelated to devise  the only thing i can think of is if cancan is calling devise's current_user 
can you isolate it in a smaller application or devise test suite  it works fine here 
what is the name of the file with you email contents 
how is your config mailer_sender set in your config initializers devise rb  have you run rails generate devise install

why would they be the same thing 
which devise and rails versions 
which rails version 
where is it from  from your app  what are your routes  we can have thousands of reasons to get such an error  can you reproduce it in a smaller app 
could you please link to some posts    
maybe devise and authlogic stores the salt in different ways  since for bcrypt the salt ends up stored with the password

what is the backtrace  which devise version  which rails version  thanks 
which gem failed to build 
can you push the application that reproduces the issue online and send us a link    
what is the use case here  require_no_authentication would only be triggered if someone is signed in and manually types an url  no 
when this error is raised  in tests  which devise and rails versions 
which devise and rails versions  have you tried with devise master 
maybe you are overwriting a default causing this error  https   github com plataformatec devise commit f332d7e932474b5620a866c8494149ab0d542c04
what is exactly the ominauth strategy authorize_url it is redirecting in this case 
can you please check the rfc and send a pull request if appropriate  thank you 
could you please post more information 
could you please explain it better  do you want to be able to customize controller  if that is the case  you can simply override it in your application controller   
could you please try out a patch so we can have an idea on how complex this change would be 
can you post an example of your tests  are you using actioncontroller  testcase 
could you please try providing a test case that reproduces the issue

maybe reproducing it in a new app and pushing it to github  thanks 
could you please update the page yourself and make the upgrade page more explicit  thanks   d
what am i missing 
what do you guys think 
what do you suggest  the best way to discover it today is by taking a look at the sessionscontoller  how can we make it easier 
when you send the email  nothing appears on the development log 
could you please provide a failing test case to devise suite or a snippet that reproduces the problem 
what is the legacy database hack 
can you pinpoint in which devise versions it worked before and in exactly which version it went away 
can you explain better which problem do you have

can you provide a screenshot of a specific image  for a lot of things you can control this with  config assets_host  and  config site_url  in production  see https   github com inaturalist inaturalist blob master config environments production rb#l46
can you please  1  trim the code to the shortest that demos the problem and  2  show the exact error msg 
could this be using the wrong roast checkout 
can you retest now on head  there were some related improvements 
do you have a c compiler and perl 5 installed  which versions  if not   strawberry perl  http   strawberryperl com   distribution has all of that included 
may i ask why you need this  it'll help us understand why this needs to be part of the language  somewhat related  https   github com perl6 problem solving issues 4
do the https urls work  if yes  i'd suggest using them as a first step  will look into a proper solution later 
how did you install rakudo  if from a package then most likely you need to look for zef package too 
can you please re test and supply a test case in a pr to roast  https   github com perl6 roast

can you tell us which version of os x  quicksilver  and the clipboard plug in you’re running  thanks 
what version of quicksilver  could it have been a temporary glitch  try hitting the circular “refresh” arrow at the bottom of the plug in preferences window

what data structure would you get in return  i can see that it would be hard to chain a _ partition method 
does that makes sense 
does  _ range  stop if the value is bigger than  stop  
why not just have  _ curry  with placeholder support  it seems like that's what this method is closest to

could you test this with a recent version of ranger  1 7 1 is pretty old  ideally you'd test 1 9 2 or master 
could you give a better description of the actual problem

can you test this with the latest haystack release  which search engine backend are you using  do you have a reproducible test case 
what problem are you having where a space is causing issues  that's an incredibly common thing that's never been problematic so i wonder if i'm misunderstanding

does this apply to v3 or are you opening an issue about a legacy version 
what is the reason to do it this way 
can you provide a backtrace

can anyone provide further detail or reproduction steps 
what do you all think 
maybe that is what is happening 
what error are you getting  please check console output and   library logs sparkleupdatelog log for any interesting output 
did you build a debug version of sparkle yourself  this does make me think that having this kind of code is not a good idea 
which version are you using  i think this has been fixed in 1 8
would it suffice if  generate_keys  had an export option 
do you have access to your web server's log files  can you determine the difference between users who are being prompted to update but choose not to

how are you checking the version 
can you give more information how to reproduce this 
do you have a solution in mind

does that help

will this do what you want  it should be an easy enough change in cancan  thanks for the suggestion 
what does the trace say 
can you describe what specifically doesn't work  what is the  can   call you are performing or which controller action are you going to 
does that work for you in this case 
does that make sense 
does that sufficiently solve this issue 
however if you're using   logs  then that's what you need to use when checking   can   create   logs   cancan 2 0 will make symbols like that the preferred method

what's the use case  though 
what about  company dabbrev code ignore case  and  company dabbrev ignore case  
could you post an example file 
could you try to reproduce this in a tiny project with no extra dependencies aside from base clang installation  and then send it to me  or post as a gist

how will this "simply" work exactly 
could you use   with   like described in this backend's docstring 
do you have   setq completion at point functions 'pcomplete completions at point   anywhere  by any chance 
does it also happen if you don't "set company idle delay to immediate" 
does it happen consistently  how does that look  can you make a screencast  and or describe the necessary steps 
would that kind of flexible matching satisfy you as well 
what arguments do you use for that 
how about following configuration  
would that be enough 
what major mode is this 
why both  company ycmd  and  company capf  together 
does you have its executable with different names locally and remotely 
why does it have the correct size in the end  then 
does it work the same is less well supported languages  in vs code

how about the file  etc init crond conf  
did you install webmin originally from a  deb file  or from the tar gz file 
when you say you updated openssl  did you also update the libraries  compiling it from source probably won't do this

what theme version are you using 
which perl version are you running there   perl  v  will tell you 
can all versions of openssl accept them

can you explain further what's going wrong here  or post the screenshot  is the main page of the bind module showing your view zone heirarchy incorrect

does  php5 6 fpm  perhaps exist under   etc init d  on your system 
could you provide more information please  😃
do you intentionally want a   in your date command 
can you attach a screenshot of these missing translations 
maybe instead you should just access webmin directly on port 10000  
did you recently switch webmin from non ssl to ssl mode  or vice versa 
maybe 9000 would be a better port to start from 
could you do it 
what was the full path   filename of the file you were trying to delete 
should we close this issue  or are there outstanding improvements needed to jdbi here 
would that have helped

would you prefer the sql embedded in the log message be truncated in isolation  or are you talking about other things too  like bound parameters 
can you provide a backtrace 
how are you using your channels  are you using the same channel to do everything  as in declaring queues exchanges  setting up bindings  consuming queues 
which version  i believe this is a fixed bug in the pending 0 99 13 release 
can anyone clarify 
does it eventually complete or does it hang forever 
does this build service use very slow vms 
did it help what they proposed in the cpan rt 
which command should be displayed where 
how or why is that a bug 
does this happen with the latest release too  how did you install thruk  does it happen in any browser 
whats your action_url like  did it change 
what do you mean 
maybe this is the case here 
which version is that 
what kind of report is that 
which page is this report about or does it fail with any page 
how did you install thruk  did you update the apache config  some systems do not do that automatically  ex   centos rhel 
could you give us a more concrete example 
would you like to send us a pull to reverse the dependency 
what would be then the backwards compatibility when super class has category  imho junit test classes inheritance is useless 
can you please add an example of a test that causes this performance issue 
what about a static helper method that does the one to two dimension conversion for you 
which version of junit did you try thus on  can you provide sample code  i thought this was fixed recently

does the problem exists with the current junit 4 12 release  too 
do you have time to submit a fix 
does this meet your needs  https   github com google guava blob master guava testlib src com google common testing nullpointertester java
can you reproduce it with something smaller  see https   stackoverflow com help mcve for how to do that and why that helps us help you 
do you get the same behavior when running outside of maven  i
which version of junit are you using 
did you test with the current head 
what does  request url  return  is  request environ 'wsgi url_scheme'   defined and set to  https  
do you really think that this has any benefit over gzip compression 
could you please post the contents of  bottle request environ   there might be a non standard header we can use   i don't have a running ssl proxy to test it myself 
what is the error message  where is the problem 
which server adapter did you choose 
should it simple check it is an iterable object 
did you  gevent monkey patch_all    before importing bottle 
why is gunicorn parsing command line args when it is instantiated programmically 
which python an bottle version 
how did you find this one 
do you have  ujson  installed  the default  json_loads   which is just  json loads   raises the correct exception 
why do you expect bottle to return

how about " notrycatch"  along with "noglobals" and unlikely to conflict with any actual module or test name 
could you clarify exactly what is expected  and what is not working  perhaps a pastie with the code you are working on would be useful  cc  miketaylr
do you know if this is a new issue   did the same thing occur with qunit 1 10  
can you describe the use case 
where are you getting an error 
what version of qunit are you using  i'm guessing this would already be resolved by changes we've made in the  master  branch for the upcoming  v1 16 0  release 
could you add this to our plugins page  https   github com jquery qunitjs com blob master pages plugins html
do we allow tests to be unpaused  will this pause count against the test suite's timeout limit 
what would be the difference between a sub test and a single test from a module  why not simply do the same test in a loop with the different member data
