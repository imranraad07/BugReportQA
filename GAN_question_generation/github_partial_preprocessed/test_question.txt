why do you think this is not a bug are those two files symlinks to one another 
can you elaborate on why you would want it to behave differently 
why is that undesirable 
does this still happen we ve fixed a few monomorphization related bugs recently 
can we implement a stopgap c vec module now that would make writing this kind of code more convenient 
would anyone be willing to mentor should i need it 
maybe i m missing something though 
can you provide some more information about how to set this up i am not familiar with debootstrap 
why do people dislike them so much i love being able to write
does that build include the fix in https github com mozilla rust pull 13043
why would you use two ports in place of a port with an enum message like  
what would you think we ought to suggest 
could we respin a 031 for this 
how will we refer to and logical and and logical or 
documenting std should definitely not be trying to document rustc errors can you gist the output with v as well 
should we rename v 1 v1 to edition 2015 edition2015 and add an alias for it then the compiler can just plug in the edition year into the path 
couldn t the function be made public 
might it be that lock file ex lockfileex requires file write data 
do you have a testcase that reproduces this problem also what version of rustc are you using 
does this happen on nix windows or either 
did you run make clean after updating recently 
could you paste the errors that you re seeing as well 
what are the types of vert position joint position and rot pos 
does anybody have any ideas about what we should do here 
can we amend this to test or docs only changes 
do you happen to have a brief or not so brief piece of code that demonstrates this issue 
what do you suggest 
what s the output from the compiler when it fails 
why is this disallowed 
shouldn t related modules be nested in submodules rather than logically ordered in the source finding things in long non ordered lists is a real pain 
why isn t span lint in context good enough 
what if the user imports a name using as e g use std io fs file as phile should the error message be displayed with the changed name or the original name 
should we add one presumably there would be quite a few of them 
could you try with the latest master 
what should be the better warning message here or i just need to remove the last sentence 
what do you mean doesn t mention the apostrophe that it doesn t mention that introduces a lifetime 
does it compile if you remove that 
could you also give the revision of rust http that demonstrates this 
what is the file name of the program you are running i have a feeling this may be because of 7188 and or 7225
can you capture any information about the segfault perhaps a debugger backtrace 
can you confirm that using the raw stat in c shows the number of blocks changing 
can you run git rev parse head the build may not be likely to succeed on net bsd netbsd but the configure should at least succeed because we have configuration for it https github com rust lang rust blob master mk cfg x unknown x8664unknown netbsd mk 
what version of the compiler were you using this looks like it s probably fixed on master right now 
should they be can reopen if that is the purpose of this issue 
do you have a reasonably small self contained example crate for this 
what happens if you add this right before you read from stdin 
can you provide a paste of the full session the rustllvm library should have be automatically rebuilt 
did you get much of a handle on it epdtry if you have any spare cycles over the christmas break we would appreciate a fix 
why does rust started emitting atomic instructions on msp 
would it work out if the impls were just sorted apart rather than giving an entirely new section heading to negative impls that might be easier to implement 
maybe vec truncate could use std intrinsics needs drop t to decide if the loop is needed 
can you provide the code that triggers the assertion as well ideally minimized as well but we can attempt to do that as well 
can this be back ported to beta pls ping alexcrichton
why should drop be the only trait in existence that can t be used as a bound 
whats the dx 
can you put the code in a git hub github repo instead so i can browse it and clone it 
what if the c string is in some non utf 8 utf8 encoding but the bytes happen to be identical to a utf 8 string 
can you test with a more recent nightly and see if this still reproduces otherwise looks like this is a candidate for beta backport as well 
could we make some kind of interactive rustfix tool to let you choose new lifetime names and have them automatically updated 
what version of mingw do you have along with the version of gcc 
what is the error 
how does this interact with nul termination 
what functionality do you need want 
what needs clarification 
can you include the code what os are you running i e what s the output of rustc version verbose 
what version of rust are you using i think this error was fixed fairly recently cc michaelwoerister
what version of windows were you on i think you said on irc you used a nightly which one 
do you have a cargo config somewhere that is influencing things it s the most common cause of rust failing to build for me 
can it not map to the json enum 
which nightly is servo on i can t reproduce on playpen https play rust lang org gist c f f eb afe ac ffc e c18f53f98345751eb4afe3ac59ffc73e version stable
do you have an error message or ice you can share with us 
does this issue reproduce if you run make clean first 
do you suggest giving the formatter the path directly and do the non unicode sequence conversion in the formatter 
do you have by chance a backtrace 
should the definition of add not be more like this https play rust lang org gist d dfa c e version 0d840680345dfa99c4e4version stable note the extra lifetime b or is that impossible in the real implementation 
do you see any problem with it i m very ok with this behaviour if the compiler is like you should use std foo bar trait 
what sort of crash are you getting panic segfault how can we reproduce it 
do you want to make a pr to fix this 
where are the tests for this could try to write a fix 
do you have an idea of how to fix this i m not sure what makes the most sense exactly 
can someone tell me 
how 
maybe a clippy lint would be appropriate here something like same lifetime names seems reasonable cc manishearth
do we have an eta for this 
should the returned pointer be a non null nonnull instead box raw doesnt do that because it was stabilized before non null nonnull was 
maybe it s linked to https github com rust lang rust issues 65840 if so it s not in rustdoc but below 
would it be sufficient to add must use to the definition in the code block here http doc rust lang org std result enum result html
how does that work 
what are some appropriate wordings fn signature fn fn type revert this one back to just type 
could you move this issue over there we are trying to keep this issue tracker focused on actionable bugs accepted features 
could you give the code at least 
could you try to give an example that causes the ice cc nikomatsakis
what in particular is wrong with that sentence 
would this api be cross platform and if so how would it be implemented on windows 
how is the compiler handling such a case if we could use the same in rustdoc that d be even better than warn about it 
can you think of a suggestion to improve the clarity 
could you try to build rust from source with llvm asserts on enable llvm assertions to configure and perhaps see what the assert is 
when can we expect this to be usable from stable 12
why hasn t this been caught while 1270 was in beta 
what version of rust are you using for me this doesn t overflow 
can you reproduce on the current rust nightly 
should exact size exactsize panic if the underlying iterator fails to yield exactly size values should size hint sizehint panic if the underlying iterator fails to yield at least lower values 
maybe it would be sufficient to pretty print the json for now 
what specific problems are you seeing 
maybe your api should be generic or take an iterator 
would it be easy enough to move these impls up to core num if privacy or something gets in the way we can reconsider reverting perhaps 
could you give more context 
can you post the ice message and backtrace 
can you obtain backtrace using gdb or lldb 
does it happen without codegen units option 
can you upload the full output of configure and make 
which version did you try with 
how d you verify this i tried a few variants myself and it looks like it works 
do you have some code that exhibits this failure mode without a reproduction it s tough to see what s going on here 
can you please check whether the issue is fixed in nightly 
could this be related to thinlto multiple codegen units 
can this issue be closed considering the pr was merged 
does this occur with 12 if it does could you post some code that reproduces that bug 
should be cfg meta i guess right 
could you c llvm args print before all 
what s some good docs on what errorlevel is i don t use windows that much myself cc retep 998 retep998
maybe that s the case for all distro builds if the distro has separate debuginfo packages 
could the patches for llvm be merged upstream perhaps that way we d just pick up compatibility automatically 
could you file this in https github com rust lang cargo instead 
what os are you on 
what about cfg any stage 0 stage0 stage 1 stage1 stage 2 stage2 btw is this piece of code in src bootstrap bin rustdoc rs https github com rust lang rust blob c c c c caf d c d a src 380100c568c1c390c837caf98338d07c4d8a0462src bootstrap bin rustdoc rs l l 49 l44l49 just an oversight from 42495
do you have security tls version max in about config set to 1 or something other than 3
can you check your development console maybe it looks to me like the css didn t get loaded 
should the different alignment values lead to this error you could try putting clang s datalayout in your json file to see if it helps 
do you mean generated rustdoc is corrupted if so this is a duplication of https github com rust lang rust issues 25879
can you provide a minimal repro as a regression test 
which url did you use 
could this be the same issue as https github com rust lang rust issues 37893
does that help 
what s your rust version the program does not compile on current stable beta or nightly playground 
maybe some sort of diagnostic is in order 
can you try opening root multirust toolchains nightly x unknown x8664unknown linux gnu lib rustlib etc gdb rust pretty printing py and changing the if sys version info major 3 to if sys version info 0 3 that should be compatible with more versions of python 
what s the last error you see in the example 
maybe we could try to show the expanded code though i m not 100 sure if that d work though 
should closures be defining uses or just uses and thus only be able to return that type by calling a function that defines the existential 
could you show the output of message format json the only thing i can think of is that there s a dummy sp span that isn t being displayed 
wouldn t this defeat the purpose of linkcheck 
why doesn t it make sense in theory u 32 u32 could implement these traits and as such be a conflicting impl so rust doesn t allow you to write it at all 
which commit causes the assertion failure is it the latest one e e 120 e36e120
do you have access to the build directory as well if so can you gist the contents of x apple x8664apple darwin rt llvmdeps rs 
can we maybe get a standalone example that doesn t use clang 
can this be implemented by jemalloc or libc malloc it seems like a trait that would be defined by the fallback allocator crate 
can you check this with the latest nightly this should have been fixed with the removal of the built in macros crate cc petrochenkov
what build options are you using 
how does this interact with drop and how are foreign functions expected to allocate using rust s allocator the boxed memory 
can you test in the latest nightly build 
could you try reinstalling rust 
do you know if this is a recent regression or did this always happen cc ssomers in any case
could you open an issue there 
could you provide the full log by chance 
could you post this on internals rust lang org please we try to keep the issue tracker for bugs only 
can you post the full benchmark code both the iterator and non iterator versions that would help with testing locally and trying to find the problem 
would you send a pr and ping me for review as an aside we should probably have ci on rust lang rust that libcore at least compiles for one bit 16bit platform 
could you try running cargo update i suspect that petrochenkov fixed this in slog here https github com slog rs slog pull 139 cc tracking issue https github com rust lang rust issues 34537
how would a proper error be issued what would the form of that error be 
why do you want to make assertions about the size of a struct with an instant in it 
how wrong am i is o 1 o1 unacceptable for some reason do we need more fine grained flags to achieve a o size o2size but speed 0speed sort of build 
do you see the same result without unreachable unchecked because i don t think you re allowed anything but asm in a naked function 
would you mind opening this issue over at https github com rust lang nursery rustup rs that s the proper repo for rustup 
would you be interested in sending a pr 
what does the function you re calling recv in return 
do you mean foo bar is accessible from other crates then it looks like a bug bar shouldn t be accessible anywhere outside of macro impl mod

maybe just use the default font in the user s browser though personally i just override all fonts anyway 
when installing vc did you remember to install the windows sdk component 
what behavior do you expect for the impl from static str for test impl it s recursing into itself through the into method exc bad access is how stack overflows are reported 
does this mean that you do not see the error on stable are you able to provide a test case 
can someone confirm 
can you try on nightly we recently fixed a rustdoc ice i wonder if it s similar 
should these places be replaced with references to the rust discord server or just be removed outright

can you explain what you mean by oddly they are listed as re exports 
how did you install rust 
can you provide a function playground that reproduces the errors 
can you provide that 
could you check whether it reproduces on nightly it could be fixed by the pr making duplicate macro exports an error https github com rust lang rust pull 65785
how would the compiler know how to perform the unsizing operation all existing impls are built into rustc because it has to know how to perform them 
could you check against nightly compiler 
can you check if this reproduces with the latest nightly 
does this reproduce on nightly 
does this also happen on nightly 
can you open this issue in https github com rust lang rust instead 
what s your use case for this these ap is apis might be replaced in the future and libstd might stop using os primitives for this completely 
could you provide reproducible example 
does this also happen on nightly 
could you post rustc v v vv and nightly version which has worked before 
can you explain more the process not sure i followed for example run this curl script then start x then stop then restart yada yada yada

can i please table the idea that such changes are best communicated through the specification itself perhaps with the adoption of an attribute as opposed to an out of band mechanism 
can you provide a recreation i am assuming you are using the in memory index 
can you share how you provided the parameters the exec line something along those lines 
which version of elasticsearch are you using

can you try and check it down maybe paste the result of adding an echo to the invocation of java in the plugin bat 
can you give me an example how big they are 
do you delete data in your indexing code also what do you mean a new index being referenced can you share your indexing code 
did you run into problems with it 
can t you simply close the index update the settings and then open it again i missed the part where open loops cause its already opened no 
can you gist the full stack trace of the failure that you get 
which version are you using 
can you gist the full stack trace that you get also can you check the logs of the server and see if there are failures there 
did you try http localhost plugin 9200plugin head 
do you know what the core failure is here 
does this happens in 020
can you set loglevel in logging yml to debug and check the logfile not the console output for a stack trace in order to get more information 
may i ask what is your usecase here and why this is a problem 
do you wanna come up with a pr 
can you confirm 
may be we can now merge it in master 
what are you issues with excluding it 
can you explain what you are doing exactly i mean are you downloading the 090 release from here http www elasticsearch org download and then unzip untar and run bin elasticsearch f 
would that make sense

which version are you using also prefer not to set index fielddata cache to soft instead set indices fielddata cache size to bound it by size 
can you identify if that is abnormal 
what gives the following 
can we get more of the stacktrace for this error do you know when this happens 
would you be up for sending a pr that fixes the docs 
why did you add the parameter to the throwable

does any one have the solution can i just delete the recovery files 
did you test it curious if that was indeed the case for you 
can you tell what your test is doing or maybe even share it 
can you use msearch with search type count 
do you still have by chance the oom exception in the logs maybe we didn t catch it properly somewhere 
what was in your logs can you reproduce this 
do you search across several indices can you check the mapping for each index if it contains a geo point for the location field 
does the end user need to know this yes warn is the right level we are ignoring settings a user thinks they have set we absolutely should warn them 
do you have any other data where this happens with or is it just this single polygon thanks a lot for all your input 
do you want to take this 
does that make sense 
may i ask you to post these types of question on our mailing list https groups google com forum fromgroups forum elasticsearch it seems more appropriate unless you find issues in elasticsearch itself that we need to fix 
do you have stored fields what does your mapping look like 
can you elaborate on this a little bit imo they just depend on the analyzer can you maybe show what the problem is as an example 
did you specify sorting the track scores feature only has effect when defining sort in the search request 
could you expand on what you re trying to achieve 
what exactly are you trying to encoded more than just the simple string example you have here could you encode the data as multiple parameters 
what is your use case exactly for instance a segment file could be very recent even if no documents were indexed if a shard was relocated 
did you check the output of your sync flush command were all shards synced as expected 
could you explain in more detail please 
do you see any corresponding exceptions on the nodes where primaries for the failed shards where located if you do could you provide complete exception stack traces 
did you edit the error message what do you refresh to check th 10th shard which command are you running 
can you tell us more about the version of elasticsearch that you are using and how you configure mappings are you using dynamic mappings or do you configure them explicitely 
would that help you 
would that work for you

why do you need this feature what s the problem with description value text instead of description value text 
do you have a recreation script i can run to show the bug 
could you provide the smallest recreation of the problem that you can come up with will help with debugging thanks martijnvg sounds like it could be a problem with top hits

where are you seeing this error in your php code or in the elasticsearch log 
do you want to contribute this doc change 
can you confirm cooniur please 
can you provide a snapshot if the data is not too sensitive or help us creating a dataset that reproduces the problem 
could you try again please 
which would be your preference specifying them inline as per your example or composability 
how did you install elasticsearch is the lib directory containing the elasticsearch jar in es home lib does the current user have access to it 
can you give more information about your use case i would be interested to know more about the big picture to see how we can improve elasticsearch to address your needs 
would that be an option 
could you share a pom xml which does not work so we can reproduce your issue 
could this be improved by disabling scoring i assume that most of the cost is building the bitset for all docs minus those which have the field 
what version of es 
can you provide the output from cat shards 
how many docs are you missing how is the index created can you provide more infos 
could you provide more info please 
how would you provide weights for each of the terms 
do you think there is a way to work around this temporarily 
do you override any of the setup teardown methods 
does that make sense 
can you share your settings 
however what do you want to know here if double quotes can be used in node name

can you provide the output of curl s http localhost nodes 9200nodes stats human fields pretty for me to take a look at 
could you provide a full recreation which demonstrates the data you have the queries you are running and what doesn t work as you expect 
what do you mean exactly with consistency can you give a concrete example 
may be we should document that in https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current modules snapshots html imotov wdyt 
would it need to be in timestamp form 
would you be able to provide any additional details about the nature of how it s not working are there any error or log messages that you can share 
should we mark this as adoptme 
can you try running the same query with the same mappings on a local index with curl 
how big are your settings 
must have been missed in the script cleanup in https github com elastic elasticsearch pull 11164 colings 86 colings86 could you take a look please 
what is it that you are trying to do what os are you on do you have i pv 4 ipv4 do you have i pv 6 ipv6

can you maybe share some code where you would like to set the header 
can you ask such questions on discuss elastic co please we keep this place only for confirmed issues

what do you think of that 
what happens when you remove the ridiculously high search thread pool 
which plugins do you have installed where did you obtain them from and how did you install them 
what do you think should happen if for a given shard all the nodes that you ve marked as eligible for hosting a primary shard have died 
which branch are you trying to build our tests are green on the x 2x end 
can you provide us with a simple recreation of the issue so that we can look into it 
could you try with java 8 java8 and see what happens 
may be you should ask there 
can you elaborate more with your configuration and what you actually see as output that indicates to you they are not included transitively 
can anything in your problem how you recovered explain this are you running on a shared failed system by any chance 
what version are you using also if you run the suggestion on just the 4 indices that are different what happens 
what are you trying to do using this method 
can you please ask your question in our discuss forum https discuss elastic co c elasticsearch we reserve github issues for bugs and feature requests thanks 
does this work for you 
can you say which guide you re referring to that specifies you can set these at the node level 
can you also add the logs output 
do you have evidence to the contrary

can you share your mapping please 
can i have a look into it tvernum 
could you try doing this with the term suggester instead that might shed some light on the issue 
how are the scroll times that large to begin with that s a cumulative scroll time of at least 292277266 years that is maybe there is something else going on here 
can you open it there i am sure that polyfractal will take a look then thanks so much 
can you please double check that you re on 522 and even check on 530 does this reproduce without search guard 5 installed 
did i miss something in your example that triggers the problem 
when will this bug fix thanks in advance

could you see what the value of indices pest total get total is 
do you mean that the higher you set size in the reindex request the more likely it is to finish without this failure

do you get the same if you go on dir up and execute  
can you clarify through a reproducible example 
does this behaviour depend on the locale that the jvm is configured with 
should all indices share the same schema 
maybe tell us more about your usage of scripts i wonder that you might be using scripts as a workaround to a missing aggregation feature

why can t you chunk via a fixed size then just process when you are ready

can you give a more detailed error message the answer of stack overflow is correct for current stable version 0131 and below but not anymore for master 
how did you create the columns 
can you retry this with current master this was a problem in win 32 win32 as well which is now fixed 
what are you actually doing with this 
would simply tweaking the makefile to suit the compiler solve your problem 
why would you actually want to do this using object dtypes in sparse has very little utility and is barely supported 
can you put up a small reproducible example actually suprised it works at all with resample finalize has to be explicity called and i don t think was put in 
how does that interact 
what do you think it does it simply won t try to parse dates times and will leave them as strings in the result 
what is the use case 
do you get this failure consistently this will be fixed in 013 these tests need a little tlc
do you want to make a pull request with what you think should go in the docs 
what does sys stdin encoding sys stdout encoding return under erlport 
where did you encounter in the wild i don t think you can actually do this with a pandas object at least it won t generate a numpy scalar directly 
what exactly is a key error keyerror this evaluates correctly to an infinite recursion 
what exactly are you expecting here 
what version are you using pandas version works on current master 
can you show an example of what is breaking and your work around 
can you show an example of use 
what is the mpl style option that needs to be changed 
why would you convert to a numpy array first what are you trying to do 
what do you expect as the result in excel as i think excel does not have such a datatype a string representation 
could we make na t nat date just raise a value error valueerror i think i would prefer that over none which would usually just mean differing the error until later 
can you try this on master you are on 0110 good nanosecond support is in master 013 with numpy 171 very spotty before though 
can you upgrade and see if the problem goes away 
would treating false and none differently break too many rules 
can you provide a small example that reproduces this 
does this recur every time it fails occasionally on windows i think we are taking this out in 014 and make it run only manually
can you post a full example with code 
can you show a sample of df 1 df1
can you give a context where you actually need this would certainly take a pr to expand doc string or give a better explanation in the docs
can u show a sample use case and implementation even if slow 
can you be a bit more specific passed to what data frame dataframe maybe give a small example 
when how did you create the pickle e g in a prior version which one 
can any other pandas folks comment on the plans for inter types 
can you provide a simple reproducible example w o the unicode 
maybe show an example i suppose the api is different between to json and to dict they have different purposes what are you proposing 
maybe try passing in encoding utf 8
should it roll forward or back we arbitrarily have it rollforward date b day bday 0 b day bday rollforward date since 0 is a bit weird we suggest avoiding its use 
can you see if that actually breaks anything willing to consider that as an api change 
what error are you getting what is the object column eg show that one 
did you try this just plotting using matplotlib taking the same data 
can you show a complete reproducicle example that i can copy paste 
can you share pd show versions 
how is this unclean 
could you show a prun of just that function 
what do you think i d recommend transforming your data before plotting 
can you post a minimal tox ini that reproduces this 
could be a bug or just an odd setting of options http pandas pydata org pandas docs stable options html list of options want to see what is affecting the output here 
how would it go about doing that 
why do you expect the self correlation to be 0
did you try configuring the engine object as well see http docs sqlalchemy org en rel core 10core engines html engine creation api and can you provide a reproducible example a small dataframe that gives you this error 
can you provide sample data frames and the expected result 
what do you get if you multiply a series instead of a dataframe 
might be misreading but that link appears to work for me still an issue 
does this align by series before doing the operation 
could you give us a small copy pastable exampel that demonstrates the change 
what are you actually trying to do 
why don t you open a pr little fixes like that are usually fairly painless to get in 
can you show the output of pd show versions maybe also put the notebook in a gist on github then it is easier to see the content
can you check on 0242 this seems to be fixed at least on master 
how is this any different that passing to read csv exactly what would your function do that the 50 options in read csv cannot 
can you plot anything 
can you give a pseudo code example of how this would work constructor usage etc compared to using just one o c

can you post the full traceback 
didn t yet look in detail but possibly related to https github com pandas dev pandas issues 30552 can you try if adding observed false changes anything 
why was the apply needed to perform the tz localize 
would you like to do a pr to deprecate 
could you provide the exact data frame dataframe that you were using or provide a smaller one that we can use to confirm the error 
what is exactly your question or the point you want to make do you want this not to fail 
could you maybe simplify the example 
could you make a reproducible by generating the data randomly 
what would a centered value actually do here is this actually useful 
could you make some dummy data to make a runnable example 
can you simplify the problem and narrow down what the exact bug is 
would you be able to check that it works with pandas master 
what are you actually trying to do 
can you make a copy pastable example as requested 
could you instead print out the repr version of the data frame dataframe that you are getting from the merge that would be easier for us to read 
can you edit your post to have a copy pastable example showing the error it seems like your data frame dataframe isn t that long 
can you try upgrading your pandas version first to see if the issue still persists we re currently at 0203
can you provide a reproducible example 
could you edit your issue to include a reproducible example 
can you have a look at categorical eq in https github com pandas dev pandas blob a e a b baf e d b c a aa pandas 4578a039e95a18b453baf1e6d409b1c4a51aa238pandas core categorical py l 49 l49 to see which branch it s taking 
why do you think you could hash a mutable object generically hashing random objects is hard and not likely to be supported 
could you show an example shantanuo could you clarify if it s on the values does calling str lower on both frames first suite your needs 
can you reproduce the crash using just the underlying engine openpyxl or xlrd can you post the traceback 
can you show the result of dataframe isna sum 
can you show an actual example the two you linked to sound different than using a commended header line 
can you make your example reproducible http stackoverflow com help mcve
can you provide a copy pastable code snippet that produces an error what version of pandas

does that help do u need an example 
what version of sequelize are you using 
could you please provide a real code example so we can try to narrow down your issue 
shouldn t it be  because if your column is nullable then your query will return results 
what node mysql version are you using alongside sequelize 
how come your dialect will specifically be set to undefined i would suggest doing delete options dialect before you call the sequelize constructor
which version are u using 
how are you fetching the jointable please show us the find get call 
what s the result if you run this query manually 
could you format the code please 
can you be more detailed about your scenario 
what version are you on regardless or ms orms will always add overhead but specifically you can optimize performance by not using sequelize defined default values and not using includes 
how does it fail please provide the test case as a pr
what does your model definition look like what does the data look like what does model instance modelinstance data values datavalues look like before saving 
can you point to a specific piece of code that does this success is not a promise thing so i don t see why any promise utilizing lib would use that 
what version are you using 
how would that work or do you mean that it s cached on the table i usually just do a hook and an increment for that type of stuff 
could you please also share your model definitions 
can you point to any reading material on bound parameters being inheritently more secure than framework escaping 
can you create a pr with a unit test then i can fix this for you in a few hours 
does it work on dev 11 dev11 or master dev 8 dev8 is quite old might be older than the 170 stable release 
what version are you using 
however there have been some bugs previously that were fixed on 200 what version are you using 
did you read the changelog the defaults should be in the first argument under defaults 
can you describe a case you need this for 
can you move this issue to https github com sequelize doc please

could you create a simple test case 
can you show your model definition and the generated query 
do you mean that routinetasks is only used as a through table in an n m relation that query looks like it comes from a task has many hasmany routine task routinetask relation
what does your model relations and bulk create bulkcreate call look like currently 
what exception model build returns an instance so you should check for model build instanceof model instance
which version are you on a fix for something like this was deployed recently so you might want to try upgrading to latest master

can you try removing that and see if the issue persists 
can you post the bluebird version used by the two versions of sequelize eitherway i don t think you should rely on unhandled rejections 
which version are you on do the queries look correct
what version of sequelize i believe we ve covered most of these issues by now would be helpfull to see your model definitions and relation setups 
what version of x 20x specifically i think we ve had and fixed this bug previously i could be wrong though 
why not just use a regular unique constraint if you absolutely want a custom check you should use a before create beforecreate hook
does it work if you use define name attributes schema users 
does it work if you do eg employee participation  role something  will this insert something into the join table or is it ignored completely

what exactly did you try 
doesn t sequelize close work for you 
could you check if console log isn t overrided in your code somewhere 
doesn t look like the underlying supports options any of the official maintainers have an objection to adding a parameter so before and after are possible https github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib dialects mysql query generator js l 102 l102

does that seem reasonnable could you try that on your problem and send us a pull request if it works 
should we raise a warning or even an error i guess that we could add a check to our existing check functions 
would you like to submit a pull request 
could you detail a bit more please 
would you like to submit a pull request that would be awesome 
do you know if this method actually makes sense for this setup i ll have too look up in the paper in the meantime i wrote up 662
could you send us a pull request with a non regression test 
could you post a minimal example preferably with data to reproduce the behavior thanks andy
can you be more explicit 
what would be the benefit of having several functions 
maybe it is a scipy matrix could you give us type x 
maybe they can have a look or maybe jaquesgrobler 
why don t you use an image map http en wikipedia org wiki image map i m pretty sure there are gui s for that 
could you say which version you are on i can t reproduce this in the current git version 
what is none supposed to mean 
can you give us maybe your numpy and scipy versions thanks 
what s the failure

can you check that it works correctly now 
can we have the full error message please 
maybe label suffle split labelsufflesplit 
can you check that this bug has been fixed in scikit learn b 1 0150b1
could this https github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 3128 be a fix for your use case 
can you please run 
when you say only which versions are you excluding is there anyway to do a git bisect or do you think it s a packaging issue
how can you use lda without targets y 
what do you think 
did you use label encoder labelencoder on unicode data i guess we considered this such an edge case that we didn t want to bump the dependencies for it 
what version are you using how did you install i suspect an install bug 
do you have a reference of nb using the unbiased estimate i think we should rather use the standard algorithm 
should we somehow identify this case then and provide a better error message or is too specialised 
maybe that alpha 1 is the same as adding one example that is all zero and one that is all ones to each class that is true right 
what do you mean could you give us a reference 
what code includes from sklearn cross validation import train test split label k fold labelkfold 
why can you not just use a label binarizer labelbinarizer unless i m missing something not allowing d 1d inputs was explicitly done here https github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 5152
maybe the documentation can be extended to mention the double randomization 
which version of scikit learn is that 
can you explain your use case can you not simple call binarizer and then map the values as you wanted them like
do you have a ref for this i am not sure i understand the usecase or the actual regression model 
do you want to do it 
can you please give the full code to reproduce and the full traceback which version of scikit learn are you using 
does that answer your questions 
which version of scikit learn are you using 
would you have a small script to reproduce your error rfe should already take feature importances into account see https github com scikit learn scikit learn blob master sklearn feature selection rfe py l 180 l180
which version of scikit learn are you using i thought we fixed that in 016 or 015
how would you fix this what test would you use to check that we do it the right way 
can i take this issue 
could you provide a minimal code snippet able to reproduce to problem 
should i close this issue or transform it to a documentation problem

can you point me to it with a link so i can see what issue you re thinking about 
could you provide your dataset 
does metrics v measure score solve the problem 
can you give us the data maybe 
can you post the full traceback also it would be great if you could put together a stand alone example that reproduces the problem 
can you please test if that still has the same issue ping tguillemot
could you share the s data

can you provide code to reproduce 
would you be able to confirm that this fixes your case would you like to submit a pull request

do you want to submit a pull request to fix it alternatively you could also move the plotting function into a new module sklearn plot if you feel like it 
can you say what you d expect to happen 
what other use cases are there apart from sample weights 
maybe jorisvandenbossche has time to investigate setting n values auto does result in the correct behavior i guess it s too late to put this into 0202 
doesn t that qualify as missing data or is this aimed at the cases with few missing values where sparse array representation is not optimal 
can you provide a stand alone snippet to reproduce the problem please read https stackoverflow com help mcve 
would the proposed fix make the following example script return consistent results https github com scikit learn scikit learn issues 8943 issuecomment 307930597

how did you build install sklearn 
could i work on this as well

maybe virtuals 
what is your use case 
could you post something i can run this will aid me in understanding this ticket 
can you provide some standalone code that reproduces this mongoose has a somewhat brittle way of handling the case where you update an array and remove elements in an array 
do you have backups 
maybe it should be that if you give an array you get an array and if you give a spread you get a spread 
would that work for your use case 
can you confirm which version of mongoose 
do you have a package json in the directory you re trying to install from 
however if you re just dependent on the structure of the object how about calling to object toobject like var field m to object toobject field

what s the benefit of id s over classes in your opinion 
what markdown parser are you using the default for the current version is kramdown 
which one is deleted our cleaner class cleans up the site destination to prevent files that aren t in the resulting site from lying around 
did you remove site before each run we use the same excluded method https github com jekyll jekyll blob master lib jekyll entry filter rb l l 52 l48l52 we aim to be much like git s gitignore 
when you tried that did it work we use file fnmatch under the hood so anything that works there will likely work with jekyll
what does it give you if you run jekyll with trace 
what did you edit recently the property it s trying to affect is page data https github com jekyll jekyll blob v lib v251lib jekyll page rb l l 37 l35l37 which should be a hash not a string 
can you please post the actual output you got too 
what are the contents of the base folder what is the ruby gems rubygems version 
can you use the latest master and try again 
maybe this can be merged into 3747
how would you word it please send a pr 
does assign accept other variables if it doesn t then this is an upstream issue 
can you strace when that happens and give us a small context 
does this affect only posts for you or for all documents pages posts 
does it work with all that disabled 
do you have any non english characters in assets css styles scss or any of its imports 
what is page excerpted 
can you provide an example or the source of a site that builds correctly with 30 and incorrectly with 31
when you add them to your config yml you don t see data myfile json and data myfile json myfile2json in your resulting site under site data myfile json and site data myfile json myfile2json 
did you try encoding utf 8 utf8 no hyphen 
would you please submit a patch to clear this value for each render 
could you provide further clarification if you feel at least 80 of users would use this feature 
what happens if you run jekyll serve source blog destination etc everywhere baseurl blog and change the file is it re generated 
what is the use case for this 
what plugins are you using unfortunately i believe this is a known issue of a couple of our plugins not related to jekyll core 
what plugins are you using 
when was the depreciation message added if during x 3x maybe we could remove it when 40 lands if x 2x maybe we don t even need to wait that long 
how can i reproduce this on my machine 
can you provide any detail regarding why you need this 
could you provide more information about the version of jekyll youre using etc basically the information from the issue template so that somebody can try to debug this 
can you escape the accented characters in the pathname seems like something else is awry here with how this is handled 
could you provide a public repository where we can reproduce this 
could you repeat the exact the same thing and push the changed file to a new branch on your repository 
what command are you running i know that jekyll serve works fine in forestry s instant previews https forestry io docs previews instant previews running a ruby 26 docker image 
could you please provide a reproducible example 
would a link to the aes linetype size shape http docs ggplot org ggplot2org current aes linetype size shape html documentation be sufficient or is more detail needed than what is presented there 
would you mind including the plot images as well the reprex https github com tidyverse reprex package can help streamline this 
what version of ggplot 2 ggplot2 are you using i can t reproduce this error with 310
would you be interested in doing a pr 
could you explain a specific use case provide a mock up 
maybe you need to re install in a clean r session 
did pointrange use to display just the points if ymin ymax were missing 
do you mind asking it over there you might want to read https www tidyverse org help first to maximise your chances of getting a good answer 
what version of shiny are you using you need the latest 0130
can t you use width details widthdetails etc 
what s the problem here 
can you share how the ggplot 2 ggplot2 object came into being 
can you please create your reprex with the reprex package 
wouldn t it make more sense to just always normalize the weights before applying them 
could you please provide a minimal reproducible example using the reprex https github com tidyverse reprex package i m having trouble reproducing the example from that so link 
how about  for one the desirable width will depend on the x scale it is less wierd though 
would there be something similar to that for the panel aesthetic what would scale panel functions do 
can you please file an issue on the svglite repo instead if you have time a reprex that only uses plot instead of ggplot 2 ggplot2 would be much appreciated 
do you mind asking it over there you might want to read https www tidyverse org help first to maximise your chances of getting a good answer 
do you mean something like this https stackoverflow com questions ggplot 14817006ggplot version of charts performancesummary

could you check this against the 330 release candidate and see if the problem is still present https github com tidyverse ggplot tree ggplot2tree v rc v330rc
do you mind uploading the file somewhere and share me the file so i can test it 
when you access the attachment you always get a paperclip attachment object so present always evaluates to true  to test if the attachment has a file attached use attachment name file 
could you send me a stack trace from the timeout error as well as your attachment s configuration 
what s going on under the hood my guess is that your processor is trying to crop images and such but imagemagick bails out this post http awesomeful net posts attach 33attach non image files in rails with paperclip might help

does a thread dump when stuck shutting down shed any light on it stream operators blocking perhaps 
what s the outcome how many responses do you actually receive 
maybe a make sure you have understood akka streams basics first link to streams introduction would be enough 
what scala version that sounds like a known scala 210 bug you can import parameter directives parameterdirectives param magnet parammagnet to fix it on 210 on 211 it should just work
would you be able to help out by writing the zip one maybe we should build a test that checks that all ops are documented there
why do you need the actor system is if for creating worker actors if so then perhaps support for creating actors would be more interesting than exposing the raw system 
do you also get replies from ping 192021 
could you prepare a full reproducer that d be easier to verify with 
can you create a pull request updating the documentation svezfaz

could that be a workaround perhaps could perhaps be fixed by the size limit logic stage in http always setting the log level to off 
would you be able to contribute with a pull request fixing the issue 
could you give some more context and ask at https discuss akka io we re using the github issues only for bugs and feature requests 
which test is that both test cases spawn a device actor as far as i can see 
how do you implement actors continiue handle messages until all nodes has seen the de registration  i think this addition can make sense regardless 
do you think we would need to update things that use jetty e g all of our http repo mocking infrastructure 
can you please post the stacktrace for the npe you get 
who is reviewing 
can we close the issue given that you can generate the jar file without the version number and the other options i proposed 
why do you want to share it it ll just create contention between your builds even if this specific issue was solved 
should be fixed by 865 could you try out the workaround editing the wrapper script by hand there 
could you provide us with a more detailed example of your configuration work as expected 
would you be willing to address this 
can you please close the issue

can you switch to use a newer version of error prone 
could you try creating a build scan with gradle 35 and gradle rc 45rc 1 and sharing it could you share any of your configuration for sub proj 1 subproj1 and sub proj 2 subproj2
what would be the benefit of this feature why not use the dsl to define arguments 
would you be interested in providing a pull request for the first two issues 
would you be interested in sending a pull request 
did we change anything there in general i think we should deprecate these defaults and instead ask users to define them themselves where needed 
do you have a reproducible example does it work in 47
what s your use case for running with gradle api version jar on the module path 
what behavior do you want to change what would be faster 
could you please post the actual stacktrace of the failing build

how close are we to publishing a 191 to get this fix in 
could you explicit the issue a bit 
how do you implement that efficiently anyway 
what if you don t use execjs and just install nodejs what s your code 
do you care to submit a pull request 
why is this better 
may you please confirm thanks 
maybe you used to think that punsubscribe would emit a message for every matching channel 
maybe poll in ae wait aewait should check more events like pollpri pollerr

what would you expect to happen here 
what is the full traceback and what is your configuration seems like you have used the wrong value for a configuration key
do you use rabbit mq rabbitmq as broker backend can you check if you have enough disk space on the server with rabbit mq rabbitmq 
when you say it kills the individual tasks do you mean it abandons the tasks it s currently working on neither should there be any worker shutdown workershutdown exception at least not visibly 
how does this bug relate to python 34 were you unable to reproduce the same issue with python 33 or 27
why are they prohibited 
what version are you using 
could you please include celery and kombu versions

can something change its permissions 
should be are you having problems 
could you please provide a stack trace from the error 
how does it restart itself and how does it ensure the currently running tasks are completed before restarting

how many tasks do you have in the chord do you use eventlet gevent or the default prefork pool how many processes threads does the worker have max c concurrency argument 
what version 
what happens if you try msgpack do you get the same results 
might depend on billiard version https github com celery celery blob requirements 31requirements default txt https github com celery celery blob requirements 31requirements default txt 
why does the traceback include gevent the pool gevent pool doesn t support maxtasksperchild but here it seems you are combining the prefork pool with the gevent monkey patches 
maybe try libcurl openssl libcurl4openssl dev it s unfortunate that kombu is using pycurl to interact with sqs at least i think that s how it works instead of boto 3 boto3 but such is life 
do you have any more details like logging configuration etc 
did you set the correct vhost for your user 
could you please start your worker with l debug option and share output here also after send task command

could you try json serializer 
can you debug and investigate what class is used as cls in this case 
can you describe your use case a bit more it sounds very specific and probably capable with the current api 
howcome the pi dfile pidfile is owned by another user could it be that you ve previously run celery as root or as another user which does not have permission to the pi dfile pidfile 
what are you trying to do and why is it so hard to follow a template 
s hould should we enforce this strictly i would be closing issues not following instructions 
maybe you should open the issue there 
could you give celery master a try 
can you give celery master a try to verify 
can you send a pr to fix the doc and mention me 
maybe we shouldn t

can you post your test code please thanks 
could you please add some codes and this information to the readme so other people can use it thanks

can you please try changing the following line in rails source code http github com rails rails commit d c cfc c ab a b d dd e 9 d916c62cfc7c59ab6411407a05b946d3dd7535e9 l r 11 l4r11 to self active record activerecord timestamp and tell me if the bug disappears your help is appreciated 
what you think 
maybe you can hack up your bcrypt gem to show what is the invalid salt it is accusing 
can you isolate this in a smaller application it seems to be unrelated to devise the only thing i can think of is if can can cancan is calling devise s current user 
what are the steps to reproduce 
which devise version rails beta 3 is too old please try using a more recent rails version thanks 
could you please link to some posts 
maybe devise and authlogic stores the salt in different ways since for bcrypt the salt ends up stored with the password 
how is that wrong could you please provide a fix in a patch 
what is in your user model around line 11 as shown in the backtrace which faraday and oauth 2 versons are you using 
can you print your session before sign in and redirect maybe the information is not stored there at all 
may i close this issue 
what is the backtrace which devise version which rails version thanks 
which devise version if 12 you do need to overwrite your controller

did you change the router to use your controller 
can you please provide an application that reproduces the error this works fine for us and i have no idea why it does not work for you 
can you isolate this issue in an application that you could upload to github if so it would help us investigate the problem 
shouldn t it be devise scope devise user instead of devise users 
can you provide more details about when this is happening which devise modules specifically in theory such stuff shouldn t be happening except by the trackable module 
do you have examples where it may fail if so a patch would be welcome 
should we fail or should we simply return 200 ok could you please try to provide a patch 
could you please provide a way to reproduce the issue as a test to devise test suite we also have applications running on 142 and it seems just fine

can you post some debug log information from the x 11x run and the x 12x run 
how is the checksum getting set on the resource 
can you get more of the stacktrace from journalctl i suspect it is the same issue as https github com chef chef issues 3153
what platform are you on 
does windows even have this i don t think windows has anything generic like sighup for behavior like this 
can you confirm this happens on normal attributes and not default or override 
does it only affect this particular service xntpd how about other ones 
what locale is the node using is it western european by chance 
do you have a proxy that sits in the middle of your connection to hosted 
can you copy and paste the actual code and the error you get on the run along with the stacktrace out 
does it have the registry key system current control set currentcontrolset control lsa fips algorithm policy fipsalgorithmpolicy  and if so does that registry include enabled 1
should we also chefignore the folder in the generator in chef dk 
do you run it from power shell powershell cmd wondering if you would have different experience with chef client local mode u user 
what if you use the full sha reference and not the abbreviated one 
what does usr libexec platform python c import dnf return 
what platform and version of chrome are you using 
what platform are you on chrome version non english keyboard layout 
can you describe what you re seeing more precisely with an example 
can it be hidden by default it seems overkill to have a vimium button just for disabling vimium 
what s wrong with command l or ctrl l 
what do you guys think mr jjj mrjjj philc and ilya 
what s the rationale i suspect this would introduce a lot of cognitive noise different colored link hints for not much benefit 
what version of chrome are you using and how long has this behavior been going on ever since you started using vimium or since a particular version 
what do you mean by can t trigger 
how often do you hit f twice and why does typing f to cancel the current hint search come much more naturally to you than esc f 
where are you seeing this can you give a specific example 
can you provide an example of another extension doing this well if it s with iframes i imagine it would be a messy experience 
what is the desired behaviour which tabs should close 
do you have any other extensions that might interfere with vimium 
when you say no longer do you mean vimium s behaviour has changed or do you mean with vimium esc doesn t close the window 
might this be a dup of 1586 if so it s a bug in 150 and has been fixed in master 
do things work as intended if you gf once twice more after the first flash in the frame 
which vimium and chrome versions is that teh nyaz tehnyaz it could be you re seeing 1279 which is a chrome bug and is fixed in later versions 
could you try again with your other extensions disabled to see if another extension is causing this 
what rules have you defined 
however perhaps we should add something to the wiki 
could you give a page where we can try this and instructions on how to reproduce the issue please 
can you use enter insert mode enterinsertmode normally mapped to i to make vimium yeild to these other extensions this works for most similar situations 
could you try creating a new profile installing vimium there and seeing whether you still have the problem 
can you confirm this 
do you have a reference to the related bug in firefox bugtracker 
which website isn t working 
while all other settings retained or just doesn t take effect sometimes 
can you be more specific what should work that doesn t 
what happens if you manually click the link while holding the alt key 
what about the content script so the regular js console 
do you perhaps have any non standard flags enabled anthony wc anthonywc 
do you mean something like map x chome key c l to focus the address bar i don t think that there s an api for that 
what would be the solution to this vimium exits insert mode on double esc 
what about blacklisting c and not just i m not sure whether that works but that s how to notate such a binding in vim 
does h go back goback not work 
do you mean you have switched to and reloaded the tabs and vimium was still not working 
do you mean a command to allow you to press kbd f kbd and vimium shows hints for text so that you can select a hint and search it 
do you know if i can assign the arrow key as an access key otherwise i could use period and comma 
what are you seeing now 
what do you see this is what i see img width 1280 alt screen shot 20160526 at 21 59 33 src https cloud githubusercontent com assets b a 13700155899722982b38a d 238d e b dbba 11e68408091028b3dbba png 
can you save the jsbin and share the link for me 
do you have an actual example of what you re trying to do 
which browser are you seeing this in obviously we d still like to fix it 
do you mean for resize the panels http d pr i yjnb
would you expect the assets and img and vendor to be empty 
can you share that application js file so i can test it myself i assume you re dropping the individual file and not the entire folder right 
would you be able to show us a screen shot of the network requests from the developer tools to help us debug and fix this issue 
what exactly is broken this all works as expected 
what are the two usernames 
does your code run similar https github com jsbin jsbin issues 1601
can you also confirm whether you have any other windows to jsbin in chrome open can you also try incognito to rule out any extensions playing a part 
do you have any specific ideas how multiple collaborators would work or is this just the same as 256
what do you see 
what s your account name on jsbin have you got a pro account https jsbin com upgrade 
what s wrong with highlighting the lines and using ctrl 
do you have an example of the gist url i can test with 
does that happen often with jsbin just wonder whether i should continue using it 
do you know what your username was or is it the same as your github username i can take a look at the db to see what s going on hopefully

what do you mean by they re not accepted 
what is the string that it s trying to convert into a date time datetime 
can you create a class and try doing get records getrecords my class myclass and see if that helps i m guessing dynamic is really slow if so i can look into speeding up dynamic creation

does that sound about right 
how many records are in data 
why are you using a data table datatable 
can you give me the my position myposition and format map formatmap class definitions

can you be more specific do you mean when doing ctrl c in file manager save only file directory paths in copy q copyq 
what is your copy q copyq version what character encoding does your system use 
can you post the whole backtrace somewhere perhaps gist looks like some problem with widget size being recursively set 
can you check is selection is really copied with copyq selection command and perhaps xclip o can you also post copyq version 
do you want to run an automatic command when an image is copied to clipboard 
what is vim i ve been hearing a lot about that since i have been testing these clipboard managers 
do you mean you don t want to store the text selected with mouse in copy q copyq does disabling option store text selected using mouse work it s in the general config tab 
maybe there is a bug in the version you use 
does this mean that when you restart the application the items are sometimes loaded correctly can you share your log kbd f kbd f12kbd shortcut 
what s the desktop environment and window manager you use 
does it help if you re convert the icon using following command 
can you try drag n drop while holding kbd ctrl kbd edit if that works for you it will be fixed in next release so you don t have to hold any modifier

do you use any automatic commands these are rendered with bold text in the list in command dialog kbd f kbd f6kbd 
can you do system update it s possible that some packages libraries needed by copy q copyq are out of date 
can you share the command here btw only in menu commands can work with item selection automatic and global shortcut commands work with current clipboard content 
can you check what data the item contains f 4 f4 shortcut also check data in clipboard if it still has the data ctrl shift c 
how about watching releases feed https github com hluk copyq releases atom there is also mailing list https groups google com forum forum copyq where i send release announcements 
what formats does the item contain you can list the formats by selecting the item and pressing f 4 f4
do you have any extensions for panel installed 
do you use latest copy q copyq version 
which os desktop environment and copy q copyq version do you use ideally post a screenshot of the problem 
what files are missing if you re using the portable version you should backup and migrate the config folder which contains the items and configuration 
what s the os and copy q copyq version 
can you provide copyq version for the 372 version maybe it s because it uses different qt version 
can you try reinstalling copyq plugin itemweb plugin 
what does ldd usr bin copyq print 
can you post steps to reproduce this

can you see if this faq entry https copyq readthedocs io en latest faq html why can i no longer paste from the application on macos helps 
what do you see instead of the file names also can you send me a file which ranger can t display so i can try to reproduce your bug 
can you try this on other mkv files 
what s the traceback 
what was term before 
what os python version and ranger version are you using is anything else happening that might be suspicious 
maybe your term environment variable is wrong mine is rxvt unicode colors 256colors and it works fine 
does it occur randomly or consistently after some time or right when you start ranger 
can you try this i don t remember the exact commit but the config line parsing procedure must have been changed 
maybe try try cat path  mdv c width  dump trim exit 5  exit 2 then 
could you upload install log txt also need the output of the following stat usr local bin ranger file usr local bin ranger cat usr local bin ranger 
how exactly are you running i term 2 iterm2 on linux are you running ranger via ssh 
what should it look like they would not fit in 1 line 
do you want to it be in the preview pane or in a separate process via rifle the latter should be easy the former not so much 
can you elaborate on bdist 
when you go into that directory is this file highlighted or not 
did you actually start typing to start the reverse search btw there s the s mapping for this 
does it work when outside of ranger 
why exactly do you want to disable it though it s a pretty useful discovery feature usually 
did you set preview images method kitty 
can you reproduce this with 192 or master 
why can t you just remove the files from the confpath does ranger create them there or something 
how does that happen the rules for the editor and the pager should match before this one does so you shouldn t be able to accidentally do this 
would ranger s history suffice i believe c o c i jump through history 
could you try running the master branch cloning and running ranger py is enough if that doesn t fix it try with ranger or ranger py clean 
do other programs using pillow still work this sounds like something implemented internally to pillow 
does ranger crash if you don t pass debug cause that would be a bug 
does the same happen with other shells like sh or zsh 
maybe one of the integrations or custom commands on the wiki can help you they re for search rather than filter but maybe that s good enough 
could you pull the latest and double check thanks 
can you run with excon debug true and post the redacted response it should say more specifically what was signed and what was expected thanks
