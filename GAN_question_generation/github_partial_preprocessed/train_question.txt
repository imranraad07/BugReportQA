does this repro when you wrap rustrt uvtask in a rust function 
could you describe what you mean in more detail would they be equivalent to iter scan 0 old next  old next old and similarly with 
how would this implementation behave when seek from seekfrom start or seek from seekfrom end is passed 
does this also happen on stable rust 
what is its version what is its architecture  what is your rustc version run rustc vv to get output 
what did you mean by interface conversion 
when you say an explicit cast crashes the compiler what notation were you using for this 
can you describe your current platform os ocaml versions that kind of thing 
did this explanation help or what is still unclear 
how does the shim solution sound 
did you mean something else 
did you run code that makes sure this is actually fixed it wouldn t hurt to make sure 
what s the problem here 
maybe we should just stop autodereferencing for binary ops that s not a feature i would expect 
can i get the testcase that s triggering this 
can i safely close this 
would it be possible to somehow only copy them when sending them between tasks and use reference counting the rest of the time 
what s the failure mode here does it just crash with an array out of bounds error if so that doesn t seem unreasonable to me 
do you mean something beyond src lib sort rs or did you miss that one 
why do you think it s misreporting it option get fails with that message when you call it on none 
could you tell me where the format string is parsed and where the types of the arguments are determined 
what version of the compiler was this with running this on e 680 578e680 i don t get an ice on osx 
does dwarfdump show any debuginfo in there i presume this is under linux because of gdb does the same thing occur on osx 
does this also happen in gdb 
what response would you prefer here compile and work or error out in the typechecker 
can you open a pull request 
can you clarify 
what version of rust are you using can you post some source code that doesn t compile due to this issue 
how are you configuring rust i couldn t even get libuv to build with an arm target 
do you have a test case 
what s your make version 
could you achieve this with a hof 
maybe this is a big in unique ptr unification related to 32 bit somehow 
can i get dibs on this 
why not write the code so that the constant expression refers to a non mut static and then initialize the mut static from the newly introduced non mut static binding 
doesn t this belong in https github com rust lang rust playpen instead 
do you need flate specifically the snap crate is a pure rust snappy implementation 
does prefix work for you when installing manually 
do you need this much flexibility currently for the leveldb bindings 
can you reproduce the segfault when compiling from the git master branch 02 is several months old 
would that work for rust 
does it start at 03

can you do a make clean update to head currently be 137 21be137 and try again thanks 
could this be another use for overloaded integer literals or would that be a bridge too far 
can you comment further malloc takes a lock in libc i m not sure what the bug is here 
what is a node for a dlist 
do you have another program that does implement a trait but shows the same bug 
do we have any idea what the bug is really 
what part of it seems redundant 
which part of the original proposal requires ctfe 
do you have instructions for reproducing 
while that s clearly desirable for the show trait it s not obvious that fmt string should have that behaviour 
what about things that exist on both platforms but are different 
why not figure out number of optimal codegen units in your build system instead also in cargo 
do plugin crates allow exporting macros the implementation is similar 
could possibly be 50586
which constants 
should this bug be filed against https github com rust lang rustup instead 
what version of rustc are you using i would not expect this to be true on the most recent incoming but earlier versions and master may still exhibit this behavior 
doesn t the source tarball already depend on git for llvm libuv i could easily be wrong i have no idea about this 
what operating system are you using 
could you paste the output of rust log rustc metadata loader make 
can you update and try building again 
did you install gpg with your package manager for example brew install gpg on a mac 
does this also mean that we could remove the logic of sometimes naming the entry point main and sometimes amain 
can you show the macro definition 
what do you think edit this is resolved kimundi and i had a discussion on irc he s almost done and will continue with the work 
does it not become moot then since that s what we are going to do 
what kind of finesse do i need 
did you want us to try to seed google with search terms or something 
can you reproduce on incoming 
does this also date back to 10 like 30344 did

what s your mingw version seems like mingw headers lack some important definitions 
would it be possible to give more details about why these tests are failing e g pasted output 
do you have a full gist available i wonder if we re trying to upload dylib to the emulator when we should be uploading so 
does the same apply to getenv setenv no race there but task level envvars could be useful 
what happens if you add this to the top of the test function 
does your system have an adequate amount of memory to run all these tests in parallel 
maybe we should document this so there is no confusion 
what does this mean when is rustdoc creating binary artifacts 
can you describe in more detail what exactly you are doing and what the desired outcome should be 
what happens if you use enc it s probably related to that 
do you have some example code that shows this problem in action how long is very long 
what is the error message please try to include error messages in bug reports you possible need pub use self unlock unlock

what version of rustc are you using the following compiles successfully with rustc nightly 100nightly b a 404 083b8a404 20150405 built 20150405
should this also consider the case when bar is not marked deprecated but it is placed inside a module marked deprecated 
can i take this 
could this also be allowed as a crate attribute and automatically apply to all public exports of that crate 
does this crash also happen on incoming 
why would it be live because the scope of y is based on the block structure of the program and not on which expressions happen to reference it 
how would this affect partial eq partialeq 
do you need help 
does this also occur when you compile the code non incrementally but with ccodegen units 9999
could that be the cause 
can you try this again with the latest version i believe this has been fixed 
how would you ever refer to the type and function 
can someone on mac confirm this is fixed and close if so 
can you use tuple two a b  tuple iter bytes 
what do you mean by currently unused are they unused in encoders bundled in libserialize or existing libraries on git hub github which implement encoder 
maybe a duplicate of 20220
why do you assume that omitting ne is good but omitting gt might not be do we have a derive heavy crate somewhere that d be good for compile time and runtime benchmarks 
what if i were mutable 
do you have a page code example please 
did you try it against the latest master 
what was the tool you used to generate this information this may make a good regression test for rustdoc 
what do you think about these steps 
should we make this an rfc 
how do i get assigned to this 
would the idea be that regex macros is renamed to regex plugin or maybe just regex 
which docs std result http doc rust lang org std result index html the try macro mentions try 
can i try to take care of this one 
do you consider this fixed sfackler 
can we just hack around it and fall back to dev

does the first a currently get flagged with an unused variable warning 
would that be useful for this case can anybody mentor 
can i take this bug 
what revision are you using 
do you have gcc somewhere in your path for rustc to find 
would this be solved by constraining the type parameter to be send 
do you have i pv 6 ipv6 disabled 
could you put all of this output into a gist using gist github com http gist github com it tends to clutter the issue a bit otherwise 
can you try running cargo clean and then cargo build again

can you paste some of the errors that you re seeing 
can you elaborate on what you mean by this 
can you suggest a phrasing which would ve been unambiguous for you 
what is the result of ulimit n though just calling ulimit is only the maximum file size unless osx is different 
why is it misleading 
does librustc llvm actually take a long time to build or is linking llvm super slow edit for the latter we should use the sys convention and no higher level ap is apis 
could you give a code example of this to aid future triagers 
what happens of you write the definition of new el inline at the point of use 
do either of those ring a bell for you also have you tried building from a fresh checkout 
could you please edit the issue and put the report in a code section https help github com articles github flavored markdown fenced code blocks that should make it more readable 
what sense it makes to implement debug for iterators these cant really show any useful state 
would you like me to post some general suggestions pointers here or chat about it i m on discord zulip if you prefer the latter 
do any of those ring bells 
do you have the full log of a session i just tried to reproduce this but was unable to 
do you mean like this one https github com rust lang rust issues 32272 issuecomment 197887534
wouldn t this give us some of the advantage of 2 without the disadvantage 
do we need to tweak our opt level 3 pipeline has it diverged from clang is it inappropriate to run by default 
do we go back to using rlibc 
what version of the compiler are you using i thought i had a fix for this recently but i may have made a mistake 
why should this not compile 
how would it prevent arielb s arielb1s attack 
why should they be different 
should this go on the mir milestone

could you give an example of how one might do this in c 
can you clarify which docs you re looking at these all work for me locally when looking at the libstd docs 
should these kinds of small type changes include a test 
does this have a motivation that main can t address 
can you investigate to see where all the space is going the build directory is gb 20gb is tough to debug when we can t reproduce it 
would you mind specifying what set of tests you were trying to build which test fail specifically etc 
could you make a branch with the bug and post a link to it 
can you provide a diff between the outputs this is likely a known issue but i would like to be sure 
what happens if you just run bar exe without gdb 
did 24989 fix this 
what s the correct generator for visual studio 2015 in this case 
maybe the lint could avoid warning on non negative constant values also would it be possible to make the integer to pointer conversion perform sign extension 
could you get a stack trace from the crash dump would recompiling llvm help seems irrelevant 
does your rustc version precisely match the version of libcore you are compiling 
can you paste the output of rust log rustc metadata loader 
can simply be reworded as expected concrete lifetime is a as defined on the block at what say 
why does this happen 
could you please provide an example which better illustrates the benefits of this syntax 
did you mean to write unsafe impl t send sized send for foo t  granted the error message could be better 
why can t it be derived because of https github com rust lang rust issues 26925 in the first place but also because def id defid is not default 
how are you compiling it works fine for me with rustc nightly 1100nightly cd a 40017 cd6a40017 20160516 using both cargo bench and rustc cfg test 
can you provide a more self contained reproduction i looks like this requires running make and downloading stuff 
what s the status of this with 20065 merged 
what actually closes this issue is it when int uint is totally gone 
do we expect that to be a sizeable group or not 
which steps are required 
can we please not shove together disparate features like this 
what s the version of gcc that haskell is providing you 
could you maybe elaborate on this a bit more 
does homebrew freak out if anything gets printed to stderr or something 
does the same thing happen with a recent nightly 
can you provide an example 
what s the motivation 
does this really need a method on box  doesn t look that bad edit made b mutable 
what is unbearable 
what are file dependencies rustc compilation is crate as a unit this should also be an rfc rather than an issue the design is not obvious 
where do you have the nightly installed there have historically been some bad interactions involving symlinked so s 
can you provide some contextual information such as rustc version and platform you re running on i cannot reproduce the segfault you ve mentioned on either osx or ubuntu 
can we add a trick to hair that treats box new calls just like the box syntax 
does set msystem mingw 32 mingw32 help 
could you provide a smaller example which triggers this error if not we could use creduce as well to slim down this use case 
what does cargo build verbose say 
did you remember to enable debuginfo 
would you mind submitting it as a pull request 
could you provide a gdb stack trace as well 
can you confirm that this is still an issue 
do you have stale libraries lying around that have been there for upwards of a month causing this problem 
could you provide some steps to reproduce with a staticlib output the libmorestack library should be included so you shouldn t have these undefined symbols 
should it be expanded to cover other kinds of behavior also see discussion in https github com rust lang rust issues 25977 issuecomment 135999955
do you have the snappy library installed on your system 
does rust currently run on haiku 
can you provide the code to reproduce this as well 
could you run cargo build again with rust backtrace 1 rust backtrace 1 cargo build and post the backtrace here 
can you show some code that reproduces this 
can you provide the full example of code to reproduce the ice 
can you paste the error that the linker emits 
may i ask what version of rustc you re compiling your code with if you re unsure you can get it via rustc v i think 
why ubuntu 1204 it is eol for 3 years already 
does that work for you 
can you post a screenshot and browser platform this looks fine to me 
didn t we also use a custom hasher to bypass randomness if we rely on hashbrown we must make sure its compile time randomness is disabled 
what version of rustc were you building all these versions have been removed on master 
does this serve your purpose 
does it miss it specifically for the json output 
does this also happen without lto 
does rhel 6 rhel6 support a c 11 compiler if you install one then rustc will likely work 
can you explain how you think x 0 should warn the comparison can legitimately return true whereas x 0 can never return true 
would that be useful to you 
would deny foo and all attempts to override be clearer 
what happens if you continue after gdb stops on the segfault 
what s special about n 033
why is locking each mutex individually insufficient 
could you provide the code that causes the ice as well 
doesn t that sound explicit enough 
what version of the compiler are you using your repository compiles ok for me with rustc pre 0120pre nightly d 71027 711d71027 20140822 005600 0000 but this may have been a recent regression 
which output buffers are not flushed we register atexit handlers to take care of the global stdout buffer https github com rust lang rust blob master src libstd io lazy rs l 53 l53 and stderr is unbuffered 
could you clarify what the undefined behavior you re seeing is this is just a standard panic for me 
do you happen to have a code example that causes this 
can you post the sha of the commit when you observed this for future reference 
what problems are you having with it are you sure you don t just need to cargo update p uuid 
cannot it match enosys or eperm just like getrandom syscall does https github com rust lang rust blob ad c e fc d af b cec c e ae src ad7c55e1fc55d9af4787b285cec1c64e3480ae84src libstd sys unix rand rs l 51 l51
do you have a simple test case 
what am i missing here 
do you happen to have a code example that triggers this 
maybe some zip optimizations https users rust lang org t how to zip two slices efficiently 2048 can help 
does anyone actually need want this 
could you provide some code that reproduces the error 
maybe you can write a pr with a test case so that this gets addressed 
may that s the cause could you try with one codegen unit as for the improvement in 1250 you might thank the llvm update for it 
which fcgi code is this i can t find a recent version that compiles 
why is there a space between get client handle and query and not between the other functions i m in favor of simply adding some space between the function definitions 
does that make sense i m gonna close this as it s intended behavior but i ll of course answer any questions you may have 
did you compile with debuginfo or with optimisations 
do we require storage live storagelive before using locals or is the storage dead storagedead without a storage live storagelive problematic 
can i take this one if no one is working on that 
can i take this up because it has an e mentor tab 
do you mean slice instead of scalar pair scalarpair 
what do we do for impl trait here 
what would you like this to output 
does this have any consequences re promotion or const checking the rules for that are currently difference for consts and const fns 
do you have a backtrace which code is responsible for ic eing iceing here and how hard bad would it be to just error instead 
may be trans this https github com rust lang rust blob d cd e d b f src d70cd490711509707085e043d18b9862436407f8src librustc trans common rs l 234 l234 for example 
maybe a sanity check could be implemented when parsing environment variables so these kind of errors could be mitigated 
could you provide some source code if you are using associated types this could be 18048 ice when cross crate importing trait with associated types 
whats wrong with simply calling default default 
would you be ok opening an issue over there instead 
does this perhaps have to do with 27626
could you move this to https github com rust lang book please thanks 
do you have some source code that we could poke around with this may just entail an annotation on a call to collect 
wouldn t it be easier to just crosscompile rather than complicating rustc codegen to generate target independent ir 
do you happen to have a code example that causes this ice 
can you list the signatures of the lang items you implemented implementing them improperly can cause compiler crashes ice s 
maybe the lint triggers on casting away mutability can you minimize your example to have no dependencies 
did you perhaps paste the wrong thing 
would it be possible to backport 41130
can you share any of your code 
maybe an hybrid system if some specific keywords are entered we propose a link to the corresponding chapter of the book 
what do we think about removing this warning entirely and updating rustc h and the man page to reflect this behavior 
did this end up happening 
what do you have in mind that is noreturn and doesn t eventually emit a ud 2 ud2
could you provide a backtrace 
would it be reasonable to make an exception for if the characters directly before and after are digits 
did you mean for your error code to spell out boob or is that a coincidence and the error code has some other semantic meaning to your program 
maybe it s a problem that encode utf next encodeutf8next isn t marked inline or are you not running into that issue because you re writing code inside libstd 
what would resolve this ticket then 
why does it take so long just the sheer size 
do you have cc clang however the gcc rs crate will fall back on that environment variable before checking the built in variables 
where are these comments from anyway sounds like a case for the new panic safe slicing stuff 36340
maybe a malformed rust log we re clearly landing p rs prs so doesn t seem like it s fundamentally broken 
maybe we could configure travis to use that this could be and i assume it is a temporary malfunction 
docs team triage second durka s question nagisa that s what you re referring to 
what happens if the last item isn t a null byte 
maybe https github com rust lang rust pull 59752 is related 
could you provide a short example on which i could easily please as far as i can tell  doc hidden items aren t generated 
what version were you using 
how many architectures support double width atomics in the cpu x 8664 x8664 with cmpxchg b cmpxchg16b is one 
can you say more about this use case i don t quite understand 
how much memory does your computer have rust can unfortunately take gb 2gb or more to do the full bootstrap 
do the above steps sound ok to you also cc japaric
do you have an example why this is useful string coerces to str so there is no need to implement this also https stackoverflow com questions 40006219
does 47460 do everything you wanted 
can we add a mutable equivalent like fn get key value mut q mut self q  option k mut v or has that already been discussed 
could you please show some use cases for this they are also probably going to be useful as examples in the documentation 
does this already work 
did you try a clean re build of your project 
should that information be displayed more prominently might be another issue sorry of this is too off topic 
what rust version is that can t reproduce on the playpen https is gd u z s 5u9z5s 
wouldn t this break compiler plugins including procedural macros unless and until those move into separate processes rust code compiled for windows gnu can t link with compiler libraries compiled for windows msvc 
do you have a standalone example that exhibits this behavior as well 
shouldn t the compiler warn you if you don t use it 
should dyn copy copy be allowed  order dependence in trait objects wrt the principal trait e g should dyn send copy be allowed 
do you have an example of where it d be useful in such cases i m afraid of side effects of unwanted replacements or maybe users misunderstanding 
where do we use named pipes 
wouldn t it be better to make that test a run pass marked with min llvm version 70 or maybe run pass with the known broken parts fixme commented out 
maybe it should start out as an allow by default clippy lint 
could you minimize the failing code in a small program 
how do we expect linker to know about abi target features or vector ness is not encoded into symbols at all 
maybe one of the two uses an old version 
what i would do is add a note instead if t copy note t is not copy perhaps it should be seems cleaner to implement that way 
did you use pest derive parser 
should we close it steveklabnik 
does cargo run not work here 
do you perhaps have your shell set up to append something like color always to all rustc commands 
can you check 
should a hash of the parsed and normalized target spec be used instead 
can you please include a backtrace in the message 
can you share the code that reproduces this 
shouldn t llvm config output this requirement btw for anyone reading this a quick fix is to add  to src librustc llvm lib rs 
could you summarize the steps to take to reproduce this as well 
can you pass the extra flags to valgrind it s possible that this could just be a bunch of false positives
why not just make that case a well defined compile error 
what s the problem bar is indeed pub 
what the heck a core dump after a cat expr errd 
what specifically is the action to take here is it about a better error message or explaining what s going on 
could you ask over there please thanks 
would you mind running things with rustflags ztime passes the output of that would provide some useful information where the compiler spends its time during re compilation 
how is examples channel service rs used cargo has never read dependencies from a virtual manifest so an error was added to indicate the format is not valid https github com rust lang cargo pull 6276
how about a take until 
does using extern c fn process  make a difference 
what level of this should be allowed we don t borrowck statics so you can do mut a mut a 
could you maybe try to reduce the case down a bit more 
do you think it s a trap even with the buf reader bufreader it s surprisingly good 
do you want me to experiment here 
however to avoid issues like this in the future it may make sense to add eperm to the fallback error cases here https github com rust lang rust blob master src libstd sys unix fs rs l 905 l905 what do you think 
could you please look into taking care of net bsd netbsd as well 
who really knows what the type system is up to these days 
what do you mean by a super trait 
could you provide more information see https github com rust lang rust blob master contributing md
could you provide some more information what commands did you use etc 
does this happen in both debug mode and release mode 
what s the difference between this and 32195 accidental duplicate 
does this happen with your code only if yes can you show does it happen with every code e g fn main println hello 
could you be more specific e g what source in what way does it fail to run 
does this reproduce on a clean rebuild 
what if there was a lint to enforce this like deny missing unsafe docs 
can you access the variant at all if the method is missing 
could async fns after https github com rust lang rust pull 69033 have such an explicit drop too or would they still be affected if https github com rust lang rust issues 69663 was fixed 
what platform are you running on 
can you run cargo build verbose and post the output 
wouldn t cargo support to pass these flags be the easiest solution 
would you be able to debug a bit and explore why the double panic is happening e g the panic messages that were printed or the stack traces 
wouldn t serialization libraries want accuracy more than pleasing human readers 
should be fine to display the elements probably an oversight 
do you have a way to try this build using the upstream binaries for stage 0 stage0 just for comparison 
do you mean something like https github com rust lang rust pull 42363
would this be fixed by simply not using config mk at all and having configure create config toml instead https github com rust lang rust issues 40730
can you try with z fuel test 0 this will let us know if it is due to field reordering new in 118
can you explain what exactly you find confusing and why 
can you provide a small example 
why does the compile dlopen anything from the source tree and why does anything dlopen libc 
maybe a dupe 
what s your code 
why are you trying to do this if you re distributing dynamic libraries anyway why not just include libstd dylib in your distribution 
how is that the closures calculate thread handles which are then collected by collect 
do you have two consecutive commits somewhere that trigger the problem 
can you post the full output 
could you post the output of rustc version 
does it also happen on nightly is there an older stable version for which this doesn t happen 
does it occur more than once e g can you reproduce it 
why is there a distinction between these two 
maybe it would make sense to have a separate label marker for the labels 
why is this not a bug in pthread mutexes is it unspecified if a lock is reentrant by default 
which version of rustc and llvm are you using does it error the same way if you use stdcall what about on arm 64 arm64 can you get a backtrace 
what did you pass to configure 
what would happen if there are multiple s 2s 
what do you mean by redundant closure the same thing clippy s b eta reduction lint already warns against 
what does equality in both directions even mean 
why is that not the case then theres even a in libstd lib rs
why are float literals restricted as well 
why is that even an error 
do i have to adapt my implementation to help rust finding the appropriate min 
what s your linkage model 
do you know if there s a enhancement request for index set indexset trait or a rfc 
don t the examples already answer that 
what if you modified the target https github com rust lang rust blob master src librustc back target arm unknown linux gnueabi rs l 25 l25 to use v 5 v5 together with arm unknown linux gnueabi mk https github com rust lang rust blob master mk cfg arm unknown linux gnueabi mk 
maybe the libc definition of sc pagesize was wrong as well maybe the abi is wrong i guess it could be a number of factors 
does anyone know of a resource explaining the terms covariant and invariant in this context 
do you have a small piece of code that you can show us that leads to the panic 
which version safari rustdoc 
which version of rustc are you using 
do you have any link explaining this stuff and what we need to do 
could you try updating your code to the most recent nightly so i can test against a rustc with that llvm 
where does this stop and end 
did you try it that syntax should just work iirc i ever use it i prefer the individual declarations 
did you forget a step in the reproduction 
what s the error message if you have any how did you install it don t forget to add these information if you want help 
what s the context for this issue 
can i give this a go rustbot claim
what s the definition of termios look like if that s incorrect e g too small then the syscall could corrupt the stack for reference here s the definition in libc https github com rust lang libc blob bbac e c cf ed ec e ed f src 04213bbac5e66c59482cf80ed47ec886e30ed8f7src unix bsd apple mod rs l 236 l236
why are you trying to install rust to my documents 
did you try the latest gdb rust is a powerful language but not that powerful ctrl c or d doesn t work 
what about the use case of having multiple crates and running some wrapper test all crates test name script which only might match some tests from one crate 
do you still want that fixed or is this good enough as i understand the bug was never in any release 
can t the same separate loop for each chain component be achieved in a more general way with the existing inner iteration methods like for each 
can you give a self contained example that reproduces the bug i can t reproduce this on playpen 
does this also happen when running cargo check or cargo build 
maybe it s parsed as an expression and the remainder is thrown away like macros used to do 
could you try a newer nightly build this should be fixed 31561
could you collect a stacktrace something like this should work 
can you give me a counter example 
maybe a reasonable approach would be to implement such a shadowing check for macros imported from extern crates and eventually to check for unused locally defined macros cc nrc kmcallister
can you paste the output of ldd on the binary as well 
doesnt fixing the former require fixing the latter while the end result is two different kinds of improvement theyre very related 
can you please edit your post and remove them 
can you try different opt level and check how the situation changes 
could you perhaps try to get stack traces for when jemalloc starts deteting violations 
what machine is it running on 
maybe we should use self type instead of receiver 
could you explain in detail though the steps needed to reproduce this it s somewhat unclear to me how you got the directory structure so far 
however this report would be better filed on rustup itself https github com rust lang nursery rustup rs would you mind re filing over there please thank you 
could you please file this against https github com rust lang rust www thanks 
what do you think 
could you also provide details about how you re linking the dll into an executable and running it 
what is the cargo project you are building what cargo invocation are you using that issues the first set of errors 
can we just derive it 
where is this link on the page 
do you have an example of this behaviour we can look at 
can i ask why do you need to keep all these gb 8gb of wiki data inside the executable instead of reading them dynamically from some other file instead 
does this error also occur if you compile without clippy 
can you try it with the newest rust nightly 
did you compile in release mode 
would you mind testing it against your codebase 
does this same code work without issue on stable 
can we get a link to the crate that is failing 
when is that none value read 
how do we make an example where the adapter shows up more than once 
how would you get panic backtraces on stable 
what do you think 
how is a syscall supported in a core environment i don t think that that will make sense
why 
do you have rust log info set https github com rust lang rust blob bc f e e c bf e 844bc65333184f90670e950233513e5c7bf0572e src librustc driver driver rs l 312 l312
what s your point of type error refers to wrong type 
does the ice occur on nightly based on the failed assert it might have already been fixed by 62233
can you try running with cargo rustc ztime passes 
what s problem 
what version of rustc were you compiling and or running there s a known pre bug 1110bug which we believe causes an issue like this 
maybe it is a convention 
would you mind re testing with the latest nightly 
can you try repro ing this in clang if it happens there too then it s an llvm issue not a rust issue 
maybe rust references are different enough from other languages that we should call them differently borrows instead of references 
how the heck did that happen there is in fact no source in dev null what is in cargo config 
what if i defined my own type that implemented std ops rem rhs usize  rand rand that type would also work in this situation 
does it cause any problem afaict it just gives you a weird way to declare main but no new capability 
did you mean to use allow non snake case instead 
what is the timing if you use the following implementation for hypot 
should we check the length of the unused variable s name to see if it is lets say longer shorter than 2 and if it is suggest replacing with 
what do you expect otherwise 
can you share your use cases 
does this panic on beta 119beta nightly 
what do gcc and clang do can you explain more about your use case and why you expect this to happen 
did you mean option copied in the first sentence 
what system are you on to help in reproducing this 
do you want it to show all available methods and implementations in the code block at the top 
would you mind giving it another try with the latest nightly 
which ones are you talking about 
why not rely on that when code like this is on a hot path for you 
why not use dividend checked rem divisor unwrap or https 0https doc rust lang org std primitive i html i32html method checked rem 
what was the c code that you were using 
why should macros get special dispensation to skip it 
could you check the code on the latest nightly 
can you post the full code or an example in the playground when i try running a simplified example i see the expected line number 
could you file this against https github com rust lang rust by example please thanks 
did you mean blocking as opposed to nonblocking if so indeed 
could you please also provide the inline asm that triggered this panic 
do you pass disable rustbuild to configure it looks like you are using rustbuild and it doesn t define all these check stage crate stage1crate rules 
do you have some example memory unsafety though 
can you remove the target directory and rebuild without it 
maybe something like here https github com rust lang rust pull files 61926files edit explained in https github com rust lang rust pull 61926 discussion r 295283708 r295283708
would you mind refiling against https github com rust lang cargo  thanks 
did you mean aarch unknown aarch64unknown linux gnu 
what does strace output look like 
can you try to reproduce this in play rust lang org please i just removed it from the code you posted and that didn t fix the errors https play rust lang org gist d fd f a a ec version 19155d33367fd16f9a296a71ec099769version stable backtrace 0
can you provide a mcve https stackoverflow com help mcve 
how is this unsound linker errors aren t great but how do they jeopardize memory safety in any way 
does that sounds like a good start 
which rustc version are you using 
does the problem still exist in the new stable 116 in the new beta 117
does the error also occur when you choose a different name for struct bar so that it doesn t have the same name as the enum variant bar 
can you test using the newest nightly 
which rustup version were you using this reminds me of a rustup bug quite some time ago which occurred when telemetry was enabled 
could you provide the entire function for context  especially depends on the signature of the function it is in 
did you remember to get a cross compiling gcc toolchain that targets linux remember that min gw mingw is for targeting windows not for cross compiling to linux from windows 
what about arm and arm 64 arm64 aren t they also affected https github com rust lang rust blob b c fecc d a e src 79b25c666fecc908539087918131d6a56e669312src tools compiletest src util rs l l 38 l37l38
could you post the full log i suspect this isn t a problem with rustbuild but with cargo but tagging as rustbuild since it s the best approximation 
what do you want to check there is no such thing as an empty char 
doesn t clone require that the result have the same lifetime as the original value if so then the suggested change would not work 
do you have a perhaps more isolated reproduction of this a naive attempt to reproduce this locally cargo build twice and see what changes unfortunately wasn t able to reproduce this 
could you clarify what specifically is the problem with that implementation 
does the error still happen if you set stream array size to something much smaller 
what do you think what error message would you have liked to see in an ideal world

what s the content of hello rs is this only happening on a recent nightly or did it happen before does stable produce the same error 
could be part of the unused attribute lint potentially related  14407 and 14408
maybe no idea 
can you explain where you re seeing separate target dirs 
can you try with gnu ld instead of lld

maybe or perhaps it should simply be rejected as an invalid request 
would it be possible to copy the index into a node with 172 and try the query there to see if the problem still exists 
double checking i assume you are talking about the transport client transportclient right 
could you list which plugins versions do you have 
do you have more information about the use case 
what makes you think that we can t parse it properly 
what is the use case the only purpose of a charfilter is to hack the text before the tokenizer and most tokenizers don t care about case 
should this be a safeguard or just a hard limit 
could you suggest how to clarify this further 
how about including the node name in the rejection exception instead would that be enough 
can you explain what we should clarify in the description

could you talk more about your use case 
did the uninstall fail because of this 
how are you measuring the number of documents in the index just curl localhost index 9200index count

what s the supposed issue i can t see it 
can you reproduce this in other maps 
can i ask you if you will add gameobjects spawns it would be great 
did you paste only a part of the crashlog instead of the complete file 
what google translater is a bad idea https github com trinity core trinitycore trinity core trinitycore issues 6541
what branch and commit 
can you provide your phase in this area and also nps corpse phase 
what do you mean to say the weapon doesn t appear or doesn t exist 
how to reproduce the issue 
maybe something like this https github com myran trinity core myran2trinitycore commit e a dd d f ecc a dcaf a e370a8dd47776d7222f1ecc27a795549dcaf370a this is untested though 
doesn t level matter 
could you please rephrase your issue and add a revision hash too 
did you delete the cache between your tests can you pastebin a dir s or ls rla of your extracted dbc folder the one with en us enus de de dede it it itit subdirs 
can you try without curse of the elements and on the lowest level dummy 
what do you mean by active 
does the instance still exist when you enter after a server restart it could be the instance gets deleted please try with an instance lock kill 1 boss too
when was this flag added 
maybe should be all delayed spells and positive non delayed spells i found this commit https github com trinity core trinitycore trinity core trinitycore commit f df b d f e c b e 165 9f5df023b746d324588f175e264c62205b69e165

what 
do you see any fix here 
which locale are you using not en us enus 
what 
why this changes 
what is the reason for closing this i m not complaining i just think there should be an explanation 
could it be a server client update issue 
do you tried to use strg t 
what 
what if the first waypoint is set to the spawn position as index 0 waypoint 
what specific linux you are using works for me on debian 8
could you try running mapextractor with gdb to get a crashlog https github com trinity core trinitycore trinity core trinitycore tree x 6x contrib debugger

can you supply creature ids also i sugest you to update core 
did you sniff while making that video 
did i miss something important 
maybe related to https github com trinity core trinitycore trinity core trinitycore issues 19478

can you check the smart ai smartai of this creature and check if the spell cast has the combat move flag if yes try to remove it and check again 
do you have a reliable reproduction and or a debug level crashlog 
cannot find any text do you have an example 
maybe better to move 6488 and 6498 to c t a 
did you get the ready message i noticed that lately it is taking 2 minutes for the objects pooling system to startup 
maybe he should walk between two or more points look at map http www wowhead com npc keyanomir 18231keyanomir comments id reply 1338259reply 238630
did you modify playercreateinfo table there is a really old bug that happens if your playercreateinfo has coords of an instance that throws that error 
why no simply update the id 
do you have any screenshot or video of him perhaps 
what should happen if a player gets disconnected buffs should still be applied 
do you mean that even though the 310 patch notes said it was changed it was still unchanged in the game until cataclysm 
what do you mean by not working what happen when you take the quest 
why 
do you cmake after pull new code 
maybe your a 335a game client is not set to show speech bubbles just guessing 
can you give me some screen shots

could you try a more recent rev like c b c a bfd da a ea d d c0b25c9a83126bfd26da8245a31ea684008d804d thanks
which branch and commit hash 
could you check what the sniffs say about the summoner in the case where a gameobject looks like being the summoner 
should you still be able to see chatter from units near the player character in this scenario or only chatter from units near the moved unit 
did you test with more than one player in the raid not only the hunter 
did test in retail and they aggro 
what is your compiler type and version  edit it looks like your compiler is visual studio but i can t read the version info only from your output images above 
could you paste a crashlog too 
what wow version you have tried 825 supported 830 unsupported 
does removing the flag change anything even the spell doesn t miss like with projectiles and such
which client language are you using which commit 
what s supposed to happen in this case 
which checks skips the player in range is is phase check or is alive isalive check that s what i meant with have you tried debugging it 
did this issue start happening at any particular commit could you test an older one to find which one added the issue 
what s the issue here the gob is already spawn and liked to the even https tcubuntu northeurope cloudapp azure com aowow event 27
can you provide remaining drakonids i ds ids 
can you try ith a normal spell damage i think damage 1 bugs scripts at some point
why close this 
could you continue the investigation checking if the alt f 4 f4 always triggers the issue it will help us reproducing and fixing it
what version of num py numpy have you tried installing the latest github head to see if the same thing happens 
would a script to find such things be helpful i think i can cook one up using ast or some such other magik 
do u mean 011 approaching and 0101 released 2 mo ago 
maybe this merits a new api essentially split with predicate function so we d do df split lambda x x b axis 0
maybe move to pandas compat dir so don t lose things that
maybe create a milestone something like info for items like this 
why not have it repr as if it were the columns of a data frame dataframe 
where do you get these notification 
what are you trying to do 
which version of pandas are you using 
can you give examples 
can u post what u are passing eg the date strings 
what version of pandas are you using 
can you post ci print versions py 
can you provide the dataset

what version of pandas can u pickle the data table and what u r adding and give a link 
can you verify that your build works and i ll close the issue 
can you e mail me the data file 
what version of cython 
what do you think could just default to  or it could return a length 0 string
when you say plot one versus the other you mean a scatter plot 
do you mean rank in the sense of matrix rank you make a good point so i just added kendall spearman correlation to the corr methods check it out
what version of pandas are you on i just tried it on master and passing in linewidth 1 looks fine would you be able to give the latest a shot 
what about df describe 
can you provide a test example with bogus data is fine 
wouldn t you rather just do 
what about pandas 090 just released 
which ipython version are you using 
can you show me a sample of the data and df dtypes

could you give me a self contained test case related to 443
can you show ci print versions py 
can u provide a pickle of results 
what build is this under i think i have schroot to wheezy sid only 
what version are you using see http packages python org openpyxl tutorial html create a workbook for usage 
what num py numpy version i m sorting out build issues right now
could you lend a helping hand 
what is the online editor supposed to do aside from the obvious does it allow you to edit docs directly 
wouldn t that rationale entail that there should also be a month of year monthofyear offset as well 
did u make build eg regen the cython code
what does print out and what files are in that include directory 
can you should some code to reproduce 
could you confirm 
can u post a couple of sample rows from df as well as df info i want to see dtypes u r passing 
why are you opening an issue for ti then 
can you show a hacked example of what you mean 
do you have multiple versions of num py numpy on your system 
what does the data look like 
what s wrong with or something similar 
do you need the levels to be what you are saying tabling any changes with this until 090 at the earlier
what version of pandas 
what s the use case duck typing with dict 
can you explain what you mean by did not work 
could you explain what you mean give an example 
what exactly are you trying to accomplish maybe put up a sample frame function that is closer to what you are doing
what version are you using 
can you post what you used to create alphas 
why not just do instead 
why can t you pass copy true 
where did it say it installed pandas during the install step and what s in your sys path 
what version of matplotlib and what backend are you using 
what other possible cases can you think of where the keys cannot be sorted other than the trivial object has no lt and friends and are not the same object 
can you show an incorrect one 
do you need to rebuild your c extensions 
what do you think cc jreback
can you show the output of a columns i suspect this is due to the order of the labels in the levels and sort index uses that to sort 
do you have duplicate column names in the data frame dataframe 
can you provide an example i find this very surprising
could you check those i won t be able to look for a couple days 
can you post the original frame mp stats unstack or if too big a pickle hdf csv to create or the code used to create it
can you show pd show versions i thought this was already fixed and tested for

maybe easier to just load page get html after loading with selenium phantomjs and then pass to html parser 
can you post a copy pastable example what is table here what version of pandas are you using thanks 
can you describe what type of data you actually have pls show a sample data 
do you have any short concrete examples of what you re doing also let us know why using a sparse series sparseseries doesn t work for it 
what cython version are you using 
maybe you want pd plotting plot params x compat  false or df plot x compat false

can you submit a pull request 
can you show me a standalone reproduction of how it s not working for you 
what exactly are you trying to do df loc 110 why are you using this loc class pls specify the np randomseed in order to reproduce the same numbers you are using
what happens if u rename nd 2nd test 
can you confirm 
maybe you can replace the data with random data or perhaps narrow it down to a couple of offending lines 
can u provide a small example of how u plan to use the different dtype frames for testing and possibly to make available as an example
why would you want to do this at all none is not a performant sigil for missing values rather it is nan see docs here http pandas pydata org pandas docs stable missing data html 
can u post the data frame dataframe summary str df as well as a sample of the data df head 
did you recompile after you cloned master this works for me just fine on 33 on linux
can you give an example and picture of the 3 scenarios 
which file 
what does produce on your box 
did you see the nd 2nd part of my example is shape 14 which is the result i thin you want no what version of pandas are you on 
can u reproduce this from code only and not s pickle 
what exactly is the issue aside from not being able to use s 25s which is already in 8419 its a bug feature 
when you say operation fails what do you mean this should actually work the way you have it can you show a traceback 
can you provide a testcase for the docstring issue you mention that s new 
should we leave deprecated methods classes around longer i e changes to save load io parsers etc 
can you show a sample of your series frame 
what does test fast sh return 
can t reproduce this on rc 1 0110rc1 can you try it out as well 
where does this actually matter 
can you try on 011 just released are you on bit 32bit 
would this does this only work for series also how would you handle named match groups looks like name pattern 
maybe we should just disallow timedelta s for now or explicitely save them to sql as ints and raise a warning saying this 
do you have a specific use case for this get loc already accepts a tuple but that s for partial selection so this would be somewhat confusing 
what do you suggest we do 
what are you trying to do 
what is the expected output 
what type is it 
can u post the frames that reproduce this a minimal sample 
can you try it with a gnu compiler or is that not possible 
can you provide a specific example of a slowdown 
do you have an example you d like to contribute 
what do you think it should do 
can you provide a gdb stack trace if the segfault occurs in pandas code we ll look into it

couldn t you use select for this 
what do you exactly want to say with this issue that this should also be possible with two columns of an existing dataframe 
can you provide a minimal reproducible example 
can you give an example of you want does order sort index not do what you want 
what version pandas

how did you generate the file 
which version of python are you using python version 
can you give an example plot 
why do you need to serialize the functions if pandas is on the other machine that shouldn t be necessary 
can you install numpy in your virtualenv i can t tell whether it s pandas or numpy install that s causing the error 
why did you close this 
how would you break ties 
why 
what version of pandas 
can you provide a reproducable example 
can you share the data that generated the plot or some fake data that gives a similar picture 
can you try this on a newer version of pandas it looks like you are using 08
can you show what you would expect as ouptput 
how did you create this store pls put a complete code example that i can reproduce with a link to the store 
can you do this with cumcount and size 
can u put up a starting frame as well 
could you post an example input and output how would this be different from a resample 
can you retry and show the backtrace 
did you try it it passes thru other keywords thru 
does this not work 
maybe just make them consistent instead of adding a parameter 
can you show what you are running do you have rpy installed 
would you be able to test this with the development version 
what do you want to obtain 
shouldn t we just disallow that a series name is unhashable 
can you make a pr for this 
why would you not just catch the value error valueerror  better to be informed of the issue right 
can you show a usage of this 
can you show an api proposal for your first comment 
what would you have the results be 
what are you trying to do 
what are you trying to do 
did 32425 close this 
do nans raise the same or just inf 
can you try this on master i can t reproduce this 
does your actual use case use select from test if so you can do pd read sql table test engine chunksize chunksize which will get the type information from the database read sql query 
does pd read fwf do a credible job with this w o the columns being specified and hence being inferred 
can you do a pull request 
can you try with current master and first do a python make py clean before python make py html 
what exactly is the issue 
why are you using a series in your example and not a data frame dataframe have you tried reset index this is exactly tht purpose
does the by issue work and just is somewhat slower 
what s wrong with connecting with boto and then get the data as a string and pass it in a string io stringio object to read csv 
how is this a pandas issue html rendering has not changed in a while you also don t indicate versions as the issue tracker requests
why are you not simply indexing 
what are you trying to do with the range e g show the output frame you are expecting
can you have the db dump the actual values 
what are you actually using his for this is not a supported method really was just for compat series is not an ndarray since 013
do you want to do a pr for this 
what exactly do you think the bug change is 
how about an option for this default is turned off may float precision none high 
can you build numpy 
why do you think this should be in pandas rather than py spark pyspark 
can u show how this was created in the first place also df info 
what exactly is the problem 
what are you trying to do maybe s s isnull 
what does the data frame dataframe look like did the data make it in properly this seems to work for me image https cloud githubusercontent com assets c f d c 416664847831986c5404f45d1c e b e b c png 11e48b188519e02b2c36png 
can you provide a reproducible example or one that does at least for you sometimes triggers the error 
can you be a little bit more clear give a small example of the query and the output you get and what you would expect 
does it segfault if you read in a section of the csv use the nrows argument to read csv 
can you show a pseudo example of what you are contemplating 
why are you doing with it 
do you then get a segfault with pyarrow as well that seems the only difference with the internal pandas implementation and your code 
do you think we should add corresponding drop axis and fillna axis or too much clutter
shouldn t the expected output be 
could you explain why you would want the suffix to be forcefully added even if duplicates don t exist i m having some difficulty understanding the use case 
which pandas version are you using pd version i get the correct result on 0152 and with master 
what does engine table names return after you try to write it with to sql 
would you be interested in doing a pull request for this should be straightforward
can you clean up your example to make it copy pasteable into a repl so that it s clearer what the problem is 
can you post some example data and the actual read csv and the output you re getting you can use the string io stringio module https docs python org library 3library io html io string io stringio to paste the data in thanks 
can you expand your example a bit this would be writing an excel file where some of the cells are actual formulas 
can you show a mini example 
can you step thru the nd 2nd example and show where it cores 
what are u suggesting for a more clear message 
do you have a bit 32bit build this test does seem to depend on a few things including architecture and the pythonhashseed environment variable 
what does the image look like here s what i get figure https 1https cloud githubusercontent com assets be ebe 319501555628620be23ebe e f 8e0f e d d b a d 11e484d4d104b54a567d png 
what else would go in set meta and of course we need to be careful about not modifying the original self 
can you post a copy pastable example 
can you confirm that setting that to en us utf 8 fixes the problem 
why would you do this 
what needs to change what is the probemetic statement want to do a pull request pls pd show versions 
can you share pd show versions this is quite likely to be dependent on whether you re running python 2 or 3
can you provide more information like the actual timings have you profiled things to see what s slower perhaps bisect to find what commit slowed things down 
what would your expectation be for the result using the input of np arange len ts 
what exactly are you proposing this is a fundamentally non symmetric operation 
can you post a copy pasteable example along with your pandas version pd version 
can you check your second example i see for both 
why these ops already have been defined for quite some time this is a downstream issue
could you write up a sketch of what the api would look like 
how are you building 
what version numpy there are lots of these we do have to fix this at some point but its not a big deal i can t actually repro your result 
would you be interested in submitting a pull requests to deprecate sym diff in favor of symmetric difference 
can you provide a small reproducible example 
what version of pandas are you using show pd version this works for me using pandas 0152
why does this have to do with excel you are reporting a csv issue no excel being able to read something doesn t prove or disprove anything 
can you report this at https github com pydata pandas datareader issues we are moving this part of pandas over there 
could you give it a shot on a newer version of pandas all 3 are the same for me master pandas matplotlib 143
can you try this out you can just change that one line in the source code 
maybe we should clarify format kw is for flexibility rather than performance i assume not passing format and dateutil will be used in most cases is faster than regex 
could you post images of what you see as well github let s you embed them https guides github com features mastering markdown 
how does c string io cstringio string io stringio self report body look like 
does i python ipython notebook cleanly handle horizontal scrolling when necessary if max width is removed 
do you have bottleneck numexpr installed what does the frame look like in what cases does the error happen this bug report is lacking much information 
could you provide a reproducible example 
could you give an example for those unfamiliar with what h py h5py drivers are pandas hdf store hdfstore is built around pytables not h py h5py so i suspect this won t be possible 
maybe we can pass x values as it is 
can you show pd show versions this is working correctly for me on master and with 0171 code snippet to test
why would you do this 
can you verify i don t see a pr that says it was specifically targeting this behavior but appears to already be handled 
can you not just construct the file you need to write to manually with the argument you want 
did u mean to put this in the pandas tracker this is way out of scope
would you be interested in submitting a pull request for that 
do you know how matpltolib handles similar issues since apparently an inset doesn t have all the properties of a full axes 
why don t you give this change a try and see if it breaks anything else see here for instructions http pandas pydata org pandas docs stable contributing html
what s you use here that you re getting object dtypes integer na ns nans you ll typically want to avoid object dtypes since they re much slower for numeric operations 
did you updated the example use pd util testing assert almost equal a values b values strangely assert frame equal a b check less precise true should work for your data by definition it raises 
what are you trying to do exactly 
do you have a small script to generate two data frames dataframes that cause the error that would be preferable to a pickle also show exactly how you calling concat 
what version were u on this is correct a string index is different from s datetimeindex and they don t overlap
can you show an example of what you are doing 
can you try with a small test project to see if this builds correctly see sphinx quickstart btw sphinx rtd theme is no dependency for the pandas docs
can you try on master i wasn t able to reproduce
would you do a pull request 
can you post a version using just num py numpy and matplotlib 
can you post a copy pastable example which repros this 
what s the pandas issue here your iterating over a data frame dataframe but i don t see anything wrong with that 
do you want to do a pr to change this source code is here https github com pydata pandas blob master pandas io sql py l 516 l516 and here https github com pydata pandas blob master pandas core generic py l 990 l990
does sparse int 1 actually work i thought we didnt parse the fill value 
how so show a vanilla python sessions that shows what you are doing
what are x and y 
did you build the extensions works on an identical machine 
can you show the output of 
what is dg load path exactly there is slightly different filepath processing with the 2 functions fyi this has been somewhat improved in 0170 so pls give a try there as well
does that mean that something has to be changed in the process during operations between two series 
where does this come from in this case there are no matches yet you need an index what would you have it do 
how do they get read in as strings 
do you want a bar plot  histograms bins and aggregates according to n bins see the matplotlib docs http matplotlib org api pyplot api html matplotlib pyplot hist 
can you attach the content of data csv as small copy pastable format 
can you check if this was fixed by https github com pandas dev pandas pull 18695
can you try with 143
why does looping matter here pls show pd show versions 
what do you mean they are both biased estimators of standard deviation 
can you provide a copy pastable example including frame generation and writing out cs vs csvs 
could you provide that in your sample code 
what exactly do you think is a problem here a list of lists need to be copied to a numpy array structure
can you give an actual usecase normally you would simply do reset index 
can you try on master there were a few issues with quantile in 0250 and 0251 that will be fixed in the next minor release
what are you expecting 
do you have some timings 
would you like to do a pull request you can point to the so post and do a short in line version 
maybe add to the docs could also add as a related example in dropna doc string 
what would json output look like for this 
can you post a link to the file 
could you check your output stacktrace to see whether you get more than just that one error message 
can you reproduce without the groupby step 
what are you intending this to actually do 
how did you install in the first place 
does a sqlalchemy engine for adodbapi exist 
could you double check if it also works for you then i would suggest to close thanks 
do you want to pr for an extended message 
can you try that and see if this does work using an sqlalchemy engine 
can you recast your example to something that has a group and another where the group is missing 
why would you actually want to do this 
what exactly is the issue 
would you have a look and see what changed and or provide a pr to fix keeping in mind that we are back compat thru scipy 013
does your csv file look just like this 
why are you trying to do this for example concatting an empty frame with one that is correctly dtypes will work so this doesn t practically make a difference 
how do you know that this should not align 
do you have any way to simplify this example fwiw you could just sum your boolean columns to get the same result
can you post the full traceback 
can you tell us which version it this last worked cc jreback mroeschke
can you try on the latest version of pandas your code works for me and i think it was fixed by https github com pandas dev pandas pull 13050
what would you recommend as an alternative 
can you check if you can find all functionality you need in statsmodels 
which version of scipy have you installed do the tests of scipy pass 
what is the error 
would it actually be useful to be able to specify how to treat na ns nans 
could you post your pandas versions from both machines and a reproducible example rename was enhanced recently 
what would you be expecting 
can you please make this a fully reproducible example with dummy data 
can you include the output of pd show versions in your post 
why would you do this in a loop simply pass the entire list
did any of the links on https devguide python org setup windows or http pandas pydata org pandas docs stable contributing html installing a c complier help it s been a while since i tried to set up a windows development environment 
can you show an actual reproducible example with traceback i cannot reproduce it with the simple cumsum example 
can you show the full output of the session input and error traceback and the output of pd show versions for each of them 
could you include the tracebacks so we can see what s happening can you narrow down what the problem is 
can you upgrade and see if you can still reproduce 
can you do a pull request for this this we have similar logic in select dtypes so could follow that model 
can you point to the code that implements this in seaborn for reference 
could you simplify your example to make it reproducible 
can you show actual output like the above 
can you show an example 
would you want to do a pr for that 
can you show an example of where this happens 
can you fix your issue report to be copy passable right now labels and varieties aren t defined see if you can simplify it also post the traceback 
can you submit a pr 
would df happen to be a series instead of a data frame dataframe their writers aren t 100 equivalent 
can you open the file using xlrd openpyxl directly and see how they read it that would isolate the problem a bit 
what exactly is the problem show the full pd show versions as well 
can you post a copy pastable example your code isn t runnable since data isn t defined 
does that work for you 
did you mean to close if it isn t working for you please reopen could be combination of python version os 
would you be able to test with pandas master if you have the same issue 
what s your os anaconda version and how d you create the environment and install pandas do you have pytest installed in that environment 
can you provide a data set that reproduces the issue either something existing online or you can attach to the issue 
could please make a minimal complete and verifiable example https stackoverflow com help mcve thanks
can you paste the output of df columns and try on a newer version of pandas i suspect this was fixed in https github com pandas dev pandas issues 13885
could you post the full traceback including your input and double check your versions hard to say for sure but i think you re referencing https github com pandas dev pandas blob e e e f a a cc ded af d pandas 473615e4e0e7f01410a0a2cc8ded10af5d393957pandas core missing py l 40 l40 which is correct
can you provide a reproducible example that illustrates the problem see eg http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports 
do you think it s a pandas or sphinx issue 
what s my df info and can you post the schema for the table you created directly 
can you make a complete example your df is undefined 
could you include a code sample to create the data frame dataframe 
did the quick fix work for you btw 
would you like to update improve it 
does that work for you 
what are you reporting 
does either parquet engine distinguish between a length of 1 list partition cols and a scalar partition cols if not then option 2 seems fine 
what are you checking for monotonicity 
could you provide a self contained code snippet that we can run to reproduce your issue 
could you provide a complete code sample for us also if you could provide the output of pd show versons in your initial issue box that would be great 
could you please make this a runnable example i e mock up something for data that reproduces your problem thanks 
can you trace both cases and see where things go wrong basically step thru 
can you provide some more code to allow us to run this 
can you have a look 
could this issue be related to 22088
would s equals s1equals s 2 s2 handle your use case 
could you guide me 
did you do a clean install of numpy beforehand otherwise i would suggest trying that 
how was lcf created can you make a reproducible example 
did you see the docs at http pandas pydata org pandas docs stable internals html subclassing pandas data structures 
do you have a link from spyder team answer also pr is appreciated 
can you try removing all the pandas parts don t even import pandas and reproduce the error with just datetimes in that case it would be a matplotlib issue 
does that work for you 
could you provide a reproducible example for us to look at otherwise it s tricky to help here 
would you be interested in this 
do you think you could also post the actual graphs themselves as images in the issue for reference 
could you show an example of this you want to find the smallest dtype that can contain each column s values 
can you past the full traceback 
maybe try clearing out cached environments in the env folder 
did you try auto completion anywhere else outside of pandas 
could you fill out the issue template including a reproducible example and the output of pd show versions 
do you need to be using such an old gcc i don t have a setup to test but seems like plausible cause as that error is essentially a compiler bug 
how is data frame dataframe created overwriting index looks work 
could you post the output of pd show versions as requested my output of your code looks correct 
do you want to do a pr to update the docs 
where do you have a int 64 int64 ea array defined 
how is this different that value counts 
do you have a usecase for ignoring the actual column labels themselves 
can you please guide me 
what problem would this solve 
did this change something for you 
can you make a reproducible example i don t think you need to read from a csv to demonstrate to json you can just create the dataframe directly 
can you make a reproduce example agenda isn t defined 
does passing a adl s file like object to to csv without the mode argument work i know you can pass an s fs s3fs s file s3file opened in binary mode to to csv and everything works fine 
what values does sas use for missing values is this configurable when the data is written 
could you try making a smaller example it s hard to see what s going on is sqlite necessary to demonstrate the bug

why not just have last reference nth 1
can you go go a few commits back and see where the problem started like git bisect 
can you produce a more minimal example to reproduce the error i m assuming pd cut isn t related to the issue at all here but tough to tell from example s provided

did you try setting ignore hidden series ignorehiddenseries to false http api highcharts com highcharts chart ignore hidden series ignorehiddenseries
can you help us out with a demo here s a sketch that you can continue on http jsfiddle net highcharts cn zsn cnzsn 
can you change anything to make it break like yours do 
wouldn t be better to filter out unnecessary points 
why not just preprocess the tick positions and use the y axis yaxis tick positions tickpositions or y axis yaxis tick positioner tickpositioner option 
should we close this then 
why closed 
what browser is this chrome looks okay also remember to set a fixed with for your demo otherwise the effect will vary with the window width 
how would you expect this to be drawn a quick check shows that neigher excel or google spreadsheets draw lines for single points 
can you put that together in a js fiddle jsfiddle 
could you confirm this produces an png image with a width of px 1000px this works for me 
could you post a jsfiddle with the setup that generates the image 
did you try http api highcharts com highstock navigator adapt to updated data adapttoupdateddata 
can you verify that it applies to chrome only if this is the case a valid workaround would be that you call this value to precision toprecision instead of highcharts number format numberformat 
can you share a live example it works without errors here http jsfiddle net highcharts ley f ley4f show
does this apply to a specific browser i failed to reproduce this in chrome firefox ie 8 ie8 and ie 9 ie9 a screenshot and perhaps also the svg file would be helpful 
does it apply to a specific browser does it require a specific chart width what is step 2
can you reproduce with the given demo you say when clicking the name but you mean touching right 
what values do you get i get 1414065 in chrome and 15 in firefox a workaround may be to use another font like arial that perhaps behaves more consistently 
did you try crop false and overflow none 
does this still happen with the new release 138 i don t see any problem with your fiddle today 
how exactly does it resolve the issue 
does the advice there help 
can you set up a live demo 
can you see it now when clicking the link above 
what is custom events customevents js 
why this is wrong event is set on a series level and series contains group element which contains other groups shapes etc maybe instead you want this marker group markergroup element 
could this be similar to 2522 
do you have a live demo with a chart where you use get svg getsvg 
do you mean that line width linewidth is not applied correctly 
do you mean that highstock should render stacked areas in a different way than highcharts compare http jsfiddle net d zdmr 43 d54zdmr43
can you elaborate this the axes are moving a bit because there are no labels to show since there is no data on the axis is that what you mean 
maybe a columnchart is more what you are looking for 
does the adapt to updated data adapttoupdateddata http api highcharts com highstock navigator adapt to updated data adapttoupdateddata setting do any difference 
can you upload a new one or preferably add a live demo with reproduction steps 
can you reproduce it reliably if you set a fixed width on the chart 
will this work for you meineckej 
can you give us more details to reproduce it 
can you verify that that fix also fixes your issue 
what version are you on how many iterations do you run before it snaps 
may it be connected to 3935
do you consider this a bug how would you expect it to work 
could you setup jsfiddle demo do you encounter the same issue on our demo http www highcharts com stock demo dynamic update 
could you setup js fiddle jsfiddle demo with that issue 
can you reproduce a case where it fails 
would the solution like overflow justify for data labels datalabels work for you 
can you provide a demo i set up a test case http jsfiddle net highcharts xq x ja xq29x6ja but even when running 10 000 points the numbers are preserved in the original array 
could you create an example simple test case http jsfiddle net pm cko pm917cko 
did you find the url above somewhere on our website 
how does this work for you http jsfiddle net highcharts gh g zu 92 gh8g2zu92
when above don t create points for a hidden series but create in any other case 
can you help us reproduce that here s my try http jsfiddle net highcharts x ft 843 x75ft843
could you setup jsfiddle with this issue just tested and works fine see http jsfiddle net rfcvugrw 
should we use some specific browser to see that issue tested with latest chrome and works fine see click on flag https cloud githubusercontent com assets c a e 1453926105731592c2343a8764e e cfbf c b gif 11e592257cfbf369c9b4gif regarding webkit movement x webkitmovementx see 4568
can you set the explicit width of the chart to reproduce the issue 
can you share a live reproduction with us i tried here but maybe you can change it to display the bug http jsfiddle net highcharts znp oa 5znp55oa 
should be fixed on the bugfix branch could you confirm see http jsfiddle net a eret a129eret 8
how does this work for you i added a custom event selectedpoints that you can use instead of single point events 
could you setup live dime for example jsfiddle we will check this 
how about using simple set data setdata instead of updating each point one by one see http jsfiddle net ajh tt 25ajh3tt 4
could you post the right one or update my use case http jsfiddle net e ly wcw e3ly3wcw  thanks 
does it help if you disable animation http jsfiddle net highcharts kt ayh g kt0ayh4g 4 can you show us a sketch of what it looks like after the failure

could you try our master branch it should be already fixed http github highcharts com highcharts src js

did you forget to add the steps to reproduce in this basic demo http jsfiddle net highcharts gvehsjvm the title doesn t overlap the plot area can you modify the demo to demonstrate your issue 
what are the practical implications of this you you see the tooltip in any browser it has display none so it should be hidden away 
can you set a fixed width that reliably reproduces the problem 
do you mean you want multiple tooltips popups visible at the same time one pointing at each point maybe you can use the experimental tooltip split https jsfiddle net gyw ydx 24 gyw0ydx24 plugin 
could you recreate issue on js fiddle jsfiddle we will check this 
could you create an example for that case if you want to see which points actually are in the series use series options data not series data https jsfiddle net wya o 72 wya237o72
how about using add point addpoint instead of set data setdata  like this http jsfiddle net black label blacklabel vmw xgbe vmw9xgbe 4
which is calculated automatically by default 
how about setting crop threshold cropthreshold http api highcharts com highcharts plot options plotoptions series crop threshold cropthreshold  for example http jsfiddle net bpqpy ko bpqpy0ko 4
does that match what you see

would you be able to isolate the code that sets the font properties or try loading other fonts

could you provide chart s config so we can debug this thanks my lucky guess is related to use html usehtml true and not setting exporting allow html allowhtml https api highcharts com highcharts exporting allow html allowhtml to true 
should we set text overflow textoverflow to ellipsis by default or is this by design for some reason 
can you provide a live demo please

how about promise catch error callback errorcallback 
can you recreate the example using plunker plnkr co or jsfiddle jsfiddle net also can you check against rc 120rc 2
why didn t this get implemented by the browser core maybe because it s a beast that doesn t fit the real world 
can you give a more complete example i ve a hard time figuring out the use case 
why not just 
can you provide steps to reproduce the issue please 
does this answer your question because this isn t actionable i m going to close it i don t think it makes sense for angular core to implement such a module for 13
can you explain why this is dangerous 
can you try with an unminified script and post your backtrace it s entirely possible that this could be improved but minified scripts don t produce the best error logs 
what makes you feel uncomfortable about the second approach personally i really do find it more readable as it is pretty clear what is going on 
can you provide a plunkr please i responded to an issue earlier today which may be related to this 
would you like to work up a pull request for it

does this fit your needs 
what version of ie 
can you please send us a pr with the change and a test 
how exactly does this demo show your claim 
can you please post why you think this is a bug 
can you provide a plunkr to this you may have an inherited transition occurring on the element which is causing the animation to trigger 
why not simply try if typeof require undefined 
can you please close this issue and instead open your issue under https github com angular angular phonecat issues 
shouldn t this be reported as a bug to angular ui 
what is the practical application of this 
can we close this then 
can you elaborate 
does this cause you any trouble the only part where it should matter is testing
could you provide a jsfiddle or plunker to reproduce this 
where does transclude create a new scope http plnkr co edit eu ha br jg aeg q kvw ogh euhabr26jgaegqkvwogh p preview i m not seeing it
what is your html in the test 
would that be sufficient 
do you have an ng app attribute on your page as well as calling angular bootstrap please we need more information 
can you verify that adding moz request animation frame mozrequestanimationframe and moz cancel animation frame mozcancelanimationframe fixes the issue 
can you please double check if this is an issue with the latest master just run the demo and check since the demo uses snapshot 
can you reproduce this on plnkr or heroku or something it s not totally clear what you mean plnkr would be better so that your implementation can be seen
can you show that other tools like restangular or backbone or ember aren t behaving essentially the same way 
can you write a plnkr please 
wouldn t that be more convenient 
could you post a reproduction and list the affected devices browsers you ve tested with edit i can reproduce this with mobile safari 61 in ios simulator

what is your real life use case 
did we ever mark that as a breaking change i know someone asked for it to be documented in the changelog
what are you doing with the meta data when you only would like to have the items in the resource 
maybe this has something to do with the way that ng repeat ngrepeat places comments around the html element 
what is it that you re trying to do there might be a better approach 
could you please test on your side with the latest snapshot from master http code angularjs org snapshot or provide a plunker with the reproduce scenario 
what should i see using your example and how is it different from the expected behavior

could you please post a sample with plunker or js fiddle jsfiddle 
can you please post a plnkr http plnkr co with a reproduction and which version of ie is affected 
how would you expect angular to know in the second case that model state validation directive modelstatevalidationdirective is a class 
would just using your own code and detecting the animation using dom callbacks be enough 
can you please elaborate a little more on what this directive should do why can this not be done with ng attr placeholder 
can you please create a small example that shows this leak or let us know what is wrong with the example

does https github com araq nimrod commit dc b a dbbb b f c a b c e 4dc2925b7a8dbbb20b497f3c151a041b02c5786e fix this 
why should the type of parse json parsejson and parse native json parsenativejson match you should change the type of small json to cstring i think 
could you mention the platform and compiler version you are using the example works fine for me under osx both the 094 and latest 095 devel branch 
maybe related to 274 and 726
maybe that was the fixed stack bottom initialization bug 
which version of nim are you using 
what problem would this solve developer mistake 
what if you comment out import zlib 
do you have the latest changes in your repo pushed 
what s the output if you run nim with debuginfo linedir on as you said before run gdb resulting output file here type run and hit enter and then type bt and hit enter 
does that make sense 
can you be more specific 
what s malformed about it 
why not use overloads https github com unicredit cello blob master cello nim l l 492 l487l492
where do we claim you re free to use compilerproc on your own stuff 
could you please test the example using revision a bc e cd ef a e ed e 7977 0a1bc0e9cd30ef1a3654e7637795ed22010e7977 
could you please give a full code snippet 
did you compile with app static lib staticlib 
can you check please 
can this be closed 
couldn t there be a more general solution the best idea i had so far woul be an additional default parameter for traversing it in reverse 
what you mean with wsa procedures 
why don t you try using the devel branch for both repositories

can t reproduce on mac os x linux only or maybe it s locale dependent somehow 
do we then use a two pass system for this too the config system needs to get simpler not more complex 
what s the bug here the compiler prevents you from creating an invalid object 
what if one wants to support multiple database types at runtime 
maybe it doesn t make sense to make a compile time const 
why would anybody want this let s transform the compiler into an interactive program why 
what does this mean how can the content be the the same but the sizes not 
why is that a bug why not choose different local names 
why does fmod function exist at all if there s mod operator

what is that supposed to mean 
which os maybe turn off memory overcommitment 
what are you compiling 
could you please run executable itself without nim c r nimfile nim 
shouldn t you use a macro there is just returning a typedesc from a proc supported 
shouldn t it be set b setb n static int 16 int16 set range b rangeb n 
why  your tests contains space it s non alpha and this the right logic 
did your libc change 
can you try gen script genscript then use the script to compile if that doesn t work as well i think we ll have to attribute this to gcc 
can you also post the definitions of vector and aabb tree aabbtree 
does that https github com rgv qml rgv151qml nim help

did i miss something did we announce you can already use async with the new runtime p
what is exactly the issue i honestly do not understand what you are asking for
what is exactly the issue i honestly do not understand what you are asking for
do you have an example that doesn t work 
wouldn t it be easier to simply support web asm webasm only 
what s wrong the compiler enforces full qualification for these names 
what s wrong with 
does that answer you 
do you want that or are you happy with the suggested fixes 
what exactly is wrong with the input box for me it has white text on black background which is fine 
maybe you mean https github com nim lang nim pull files 13339files diff ae c b e e f b d r 222 3133183ae7c444b928e3e590f4b1d217r222

what sort of ppc 64 ppc64 system did you test it on 
what about using d danger instead of d release also did you try packedjson or other nimble json decode libs and does that json performance affect your actual app not some microbenchmarks 
can t be much 
can you provide an examples that doesn t use platform dependent api 
what do you think larsmans 
can you provide the lines that lead to the crash

do you expect the result to be one class per sample 
do i understand it correctly that you suggest something more than scaling by n samples and that it is not really clear what to do in the l 2 l2 case 
what output format would you want the progress to be 
where have you been so far 
can you please summarize your analysis 
do you speak about this section in tutorial  http scikit learn org stable tutorial basic tutorial html loading an example dataset alex

does this problem appear also with the stable version did the compilation finish without problems 
can you send a pr 
how did you install scikit learn 
do you have a simple example of roc curve producing fpr tpr pairs that do not start at 0 it would be helpful for me to fix the problem

do you mean in the example script on the webpage 
would you consider sending us a pull request that fix the pb it should include a non regression test 
did erg mention random failure 
what numpy blas version are your running thx peter
can you reproduce it if you only run this specific test with the following 
maybe briancheung could have a look at the test code i just generate an indicator matrix and add some gaussian noise then use discretization to get the true label 
can you try with an upgraded cython 
what happens if you make test or do the ipython version from any other folder cheers andy
can you try py sklearn py27sklearn instead maybe they upgraded it

would it solve the problem on your box thanks for reporting
could you please tell me which version of numpy you have installed cheers andy
which version are you using i ll try to have a look later

do you see any cpu usage if one of the jobs segfaults the pool will hang and not show any cpu usage 
which density computation are you referring to and which scipy implementation are you talking about there is no gmm in scipy right 
would to care to try and fix it some other way make doc noplot to build the docs quickly 
maybe we can avoid this usecase 
why do you want that alpha 1 is pretty rare but i don t see why it shouldn t be allowed 
could it be that the underlying blas implementation uses multiple threads afaik lasso implements coordinate descent w o using blas routines but i might be wrong there

can you give an example of data together with the wrong output and the expected output 
do you want to fix this in a pr 
did you use pip at any point maybe try reinstalling all three using conda 
would you make that sparse too 
which version of scikit learn are you using i think this should be fixed in master it seems odd that you get an error though how did you install 
maybe there is something wrong in the newer version of numpy 
maybe add a section in the user guide we could just add a doctest that does 
do you just want a util that splits data into chunks runs predict through joblib parallel then stacks the results 
can you give a reference of a paper using this in a machine learning application also have you checked our inclusion criteria in the faq http scikit learn org dev faq html can i add this new algorithm that i or someone else just published
how are you doing the import try something like 
could you put together a standalone example so that we can try to reproduce the problem 
which os are you using 
can i work on this issue 
why is that an issue you run out of memory try using fewer processes
did you try init random that should make a big difference 
maybe you refer to that 
could you try upgrading re installing your numpy also refer this so answer http stackoverflow com a 183693123109769
what do you mean by good integration 
what kind of metric are you using for clustering

do you mind sharing your matlab s results for the iris dataset a gist would be great thanks 
can you share a benchmark 
can you try casting your input to float 64 float64
how much is really slow it should be 15 times slower i guess also the docstring is not very helpful i think 
could you try to provide a snippet that reproduces the problem 
which method are you using ball tree or brute 
shouldn t the user be setting the idf diag matrix rather i agree that setting a private attribute is ugly so the question is shouldn t we make it public 
can you provide your matrix how big is it how sparse is it or even better can you provide some code reproducing the problem 
what do you suggest to eventually throw a warning

what makes you believe it was lost http scikit learn org stable developers contributing html contributing pull requests http scikit learn org dev developers contributing html contributing pull requests
can you please provide a self contained example to reproduce and the full trace back also please try using numpy arrays instead of pandas dataframes though it should work with dataframes 
how about use a sparse matrix of d 3d array some extra probability are imported though 
can i work on it and make a pr 
would you be willing to submit a patch and some more robust unit tests than what we presently have 
what makes you think that there is a problem with scikit learn 
do you want to provide a regression test and a fix

maybe importing the cython function from a pure python script and running the timings there would safer just to be sure 
could you give us a small example 
can you check if 7356 fixes this 
what makes you think binary clf curve ever intentionally supported multilabel data certainly it s not documented as such not tested as such and it s called binary for a reason 
do you want to fix it 
does such graph fit in your memory computer 
maybe jmetzen can comment on this 
may i investigate work on this jnothman 
do you have a full reproducible example 
could you please give an example it is hard to understand what you mean by none vectors 
maybe we should rely on the tests to ensure the correctness of the code another concern is time 1 complete job takes over 40 minutes 
why 01 and or why 05 i assume we took the default from liblinear i would rather not change it unless there s significant evidence that the current value doesn t make sense 
do you have know a good implementation with bsd like license 
what is the use case 
shouldn t this correspond to a non active status in openml are such datasets usable used 
do we need to store the transformer in transformers 
why do you believe this is our problem not jsonpickle s 
can you provide a stand alone script to reproduce the problem please read https stackoverflow com help mcve without this it is very hard for us to provide any kind of help 
why is this an issue 
can reproduce on master this looks like a regression

what linear algebra backend are you using on mac conda mkl or apple accelerate framework 
do u have installed numpy on your system progyan 1997 progyan1997
how did you run the script 
can this be reproduced with the rbf kernel as well 
do you expect that kfold yields the same none error that strafitied kfold strafitiedkfold 
what s the complete traceback it s more likely to be a keras issue i think 
which version of sklearn are you running this is weird since it looks like you didn t provide y but estimator score requires y but estimator fit apparently didn t 
do i miss something 
what does verbose 1 output i would be okay with this kind of change but we don t have any clear rules for it

which artwork fwiw 
does passing in labels help otherwise how is the function to determine which is the positive and which the negative class
why do you believe it is wrong 
can i work on this or it needs some further discussion 
what is elastic net elasticnet path i don t see it in our api

why 
could you try scikit learn 0191 for instance with cython 0273 please 
where s the error looks all good to me 
can i work on this issue if no one is assigned to it 
does this happen when importing sklearn or particular submodules also worth checking if importing joblib alone does this in which case it should be raised there 
did you scale the features r might be doing it for you
may i take this as my first fix 
should we close this issue 
can i work on this request 
what is modelfit please provide a runnable snippet 
what do you say is the right model elastic net elasticnet uses enet path did you check the parametrization 
how did you choose the initial values init e 11e 3 if this results from some kind of well known initialization strategy we could probably support it 
would you be interested in making it politinsa 
how about we do both we test predict decision function on iris and check support vectors on something without duplicate data points that way we test both things 
maybe heidiseibold has an r implementation though 
does make html work 
don t we have tests to assess that results are the same across solvers why is this not picked up can you provide a non regression test 
does that not work 
why would you expect high accuracy on digits 
maybe you will create a pull request 
why do you want to do that 
can we close this 
do you have an idea of the work necessary for this i don t and haven t yet looked into it

can you clarify what the data you re looking for is 
what kind of hardware did you end up running the sentry server itself on

can you show the value you re passing for the os context 
can you clarify 
maybe we just cap on len for some sanity check 
can you share which ones you are using 
can you confirm that the beat process is running and redis is configured correctly alert emails go through the digest background which needs both of those 
why not use our official sentry https hub docker com sentry image 
do you have more than one server running if so this would indicate that it s installed on one server and not the others etc there s no other reason that d happen

can you provide a more concrete url

can you explain what you mean 
whats the actual problem youre having 
which sdk are you using how do you have it setup

did they possibly do a rollback 
do the issues have similar stack traces sentry uses stack frame information to calculate similarity and group events together 
could you share whatever your config or script is 
does this answer your question 
can you describe the use case a bit more are you using something like service name servicename frontend as a tag 
what behavior are you looking for by additionally ignoring for time 1time 
where is the pii appearing are you sure you have server side scrubbing enabled 
what should we actually be returning here then there is no body at all i guess omitting content type entirely

can you edit with error pasted as a code block not a quoted comment

what is the suggested fix here it seems like you need to specify a newer version of sphin which fixes this issue 
can you replicate the issue by executing the same build command locally it might take set up of our extension locally as well 
can you give your build number for your browser theme issues can be filed here https github com rtfd sphinx rtd theme
what url are you noticing this issue 
can you re test login later please 
maybe we can fix that by doing a wipe of that version and re build lwm can you try that 
can you clarify it a bit do you want to remove this documentation http glusterfs readthedocs org do you own that project who does 
can you try building again 
should we include that in the message about what to report 
which version of sphinx are you using locally 
do you have an idea of how long the timeout should be set to for your case 
did you change something otherwise we can close this issue 
does installing the version of pillow that you require in your environment help 
can we fix that somehow ourselves 
maybe this is a conda problem can you try building locally 
could you solve the other problem 
do you have a test case or a version of this happening on readthedocs org we can t do much with this as currently reported 
can you take a look at this 
maybe the same as https github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 893 i think you can deactivate each tag version in the versions section 
did you solve the problem 
what was the problem 
did you try by wiping your versions i imported this project in my local instance and i got the proper versions selected captura de pantalla https 20180305205127https user images githubusercontent com e b e fb 244656370099341677e63820b711e898fb aefffe c ed aefffe98c3ed png 
can you provide more information your project url requirements file etc you can use the sphinx version that you want by putting it on your requirements file
do you also remove the webhook from read the docs integrations on the admin section 
can you try building your docs again manually i think this was a temporal problem 
could you perhaps convert your doc into markdown in a git hub github repository and use that to quickstart a read the docs page https github com rtfd readthedocs org quickstart for github hosted projects 
did you try importing manually your project https readthedocs org dashboard import manual 
do you mean the badges aren t shown on http phate readthedocs io en dev i m using firefox maybe a cache thing try ctrl f 5 f5 to update the page 
can you get the email address of phonchi from the repositroy commit log https github com phonchi chipwhisperer

could you provide that data that was in the issue template please this is username project url and a way to reproduce your issue thanks 
did you try setting this in your rtd configuration file https docs readthedocs io en latest yaml config html build image
did you try building this locally does it work with py 36 py36
can we keep the conversation just in one issue or i misunderstood and those are different problems 
did you try wiping the environment before triggering a build versions edit wipe 
what do you think 
maybe a file with wrong encoding 
can you please check now 
can you please try rebuilding latest or master that way the versions are refreshed 
can you also increase the memory limit https readthedocs org projects oapackage builds 7942643 there are no error details so i cannot see exactly where in the installation the error is generated 
what are the requirements to use this feature maybe there is something that needs to be installed 
what i can see is conda installing a new version of python now 37 instead of 36 maybe some incompatible packages 
can you describe what happened to get into this state 
does this work locally for you 
did you try building with python 3 python3 you can change this in the admin panel of your project or using a configuration file https docs readthedocs io en latest yaml config html
maybe this is a sphinx bug also to pin dependencies using conda we have this https github com rtfd readthedocs org issues 3829 we are waiting for a conda release 
did you read this https docs readthedocs io en latest guides build using too many resources html if that doesn t help i ll investigate a little more also you can request more time memory is nothing else helps 
does this error happen because conda uses too much memory i think it can be i ll test this locally later
when a version is inactive the docs are deleted so i guess google will stop to show those results 
when building your docs locally do you see the same behavior i don t think this is a rtd issue i think you need https docs python org library 3library functools html functools wraps
maybe a build to master was triggered by a webhook can you check the webhook responses if there is a push to develop what branches are marked to build 
do you notice the same issue when building locally 
can you trying wiping the version first admin versions edit wipe

can you please explain a little more why do you need permissions why gmr can t give you permissions 
how are you using docker do you mean running the whole project with docker or https docs readthedocs io en stable development buildenvironments html 
could you check https docs readthedocs io en stable guides build using too many resources html first if that doesn t work we can increase the build limits for your project 
maybe can you try https sphinx autoapi readthedocs io en latest it doesn t require to install the project to get the docstrings 
can you try saving the domain 
how long do the builds take locally we also have a guide on what to do if your builds take too many resources that might be worth looking at https docs readthedocs io en stable guides build using too many resources html
can you provide your rtd project i need to check the builds but i believe we build latest if master changes

which emacs version do you have when i saw the same issue it was with an emacs snapshot from a couple of months ago iirc 
did you mean to file this on the cider project https github com clojure emacs cider i think that s probably where the ticket belongs 
what is the output of the following shell command 
can you paste the css as a gist perhaps 
which emacs version do you have 
did it work when you re started emacs 
does it work if you comment out the require init ido line in init el 
did you figure this out 
what s your emacs version 
does that help  i ll add this info to the readme 
should you perhaps be using default frame alist rather than default frame 
did you file a bug report for the crash 
which version of emacs do you have 
can you give me an example that i can reproduce and which emacs version do you have p s i have noticed some quirks with electric pair mode myself 
what is this after load macro for 
what s in messages is there any sign that packages were being downloaded and installed 
did you install this config on win 81
what emacs version do you have 
which emacs version do you have in the latest head version electric indent inhibit is set to t by python mode so electric indent mode isn t active there 
do you have the latest slime package and which common lisp implementation are you using i ll give this a try myself when i get a few minutes 
which emacs version do you have with which shell and on what platform 
what s changed with the mouse scrolling 
how were you setting the proxies or are you on a mac and relying on init proxies el 
do you see the problem when starting emacs in the terminal or creating a terminal frame using emacsclient i ve tried both with my emacs and can t reproduce this 
which emacs version 
did you use the filename lisp init local el as you wrote above or lisp init local el it should be the latter 
which version of emacs are you using and on which platform

what else do you need an official release 
would this work in your case 
can you please also paste the bit above exception message 
does http gist github com 591823 look ok 
can you point out where this is in a spec so that we can implement it correctly

could you try running against current master d e aedb a e a cf ea ca a f 41 d0e8aedb18a830356e4a624cf6ea36ca303a7f41 might have fixed it 
what exception should we raise i think it can be fixed by setting env rack request cookie string after the hash has been generated thus not setting it when an exception is raised 
might need some more specifics benchmarks etc 
maybe you miss that d 0 d0 is an invalid utf 8 character 
what are your using instead could you give an example of this 
did you verify that rack lint s error message is incorrect and your content length header matches the length of the response s body

how does the secret get into the env anyway 
what does this have to do with rack 
can you please provide your whole middleware stack

what would you expect to happen 
would you mind sending a pr so we can see the diffs if it s not too much work

can you confirm it works 
can you try with beta 100beta 3 instead of master 
does this work with 01210 and beta 100beta 3
does it also happen for you with older em releases beta 4 and beta 3
can you repro this without em synchrony 
maybe it s a problem in the cipher i m able to connect by using ruby open ssl openssl ssl ssl socket sslsocket new 
can you try a newer 100 version

does this answer your question thanks for your feedback flo
why do you think that how to reproduce this error 
what s your use case 
can you give a working not working full example template 
how should people test for products being hidden 
what ruby version and what liquid version are you running 
maybe it was supposed to make it not explode when you pass in something that s not a string dylanahsmith eapache ideas 
what exactly do you mean by number formatting something like sprintf 
do you mean utc 14 it looks to me like utc 14 isn t a standard timezone 
can you give some more details what s the actual code you are using 
why are you stripping the pattern using split and not something like remove https shopify github io liquid filters remove that s not the intended function of split 
can you show a more complete example that reproduces your problem what s your template and what is your variables 
did you mean assign

how do you have a stack trace from android studio what version of android studio 
did you enable incremental compile 
does this happen with any other version pages e g https docs gradle org nightly release notes html https docs gradle org release 50release notes html https docs gradle org release 60release notes html
would you mind checking if the issue also occurs with 33 any somewhat reproducible sample project would help tremendously 
does your example project above exhibit this behavior in some way 
does the task fail 
can you please provide a reproducible example project also you might want to use a composite build https docs gradle org current userguide composite builds html instead of manually adjusting eclipse classpath files 
what s the result of running gradle dependencies from the command line 
could you please push a reproducible example to git hub github that would make it easier for us to fix the problem 
how do you do that mostly likely with something like project tasks with type withtype  configure or project plugins with type withtype  configure can you elaborate on your use case 
could you tell us about your environment gradle version os etc as well build scan preferred 
what happens when you run gradlew i home gradle init d fail gradle 
can you think of any particular interaction or thing about your project that might make this issue distinct from others 
does this mean that you cannot use gradle at all because your organization does not allow requests with the default user agent 
do you agree the problem you are describing has been on my radar https github com jenkinsci gradle plugin blob master src test groovy hudson plugins gradle gradle plugin integration test gradlepluginintegrationtest groovy l 204 l204
which version of gradle were you using before 
could you provide us a sample project to reproduce this issue it would help a lot 
could you please provide a reproducible sample 
when a task is not up to date and its output is used downstream 
would the message be enough or do you need the full stacktrace 
would you be interest in providing a fix for it 
do you see the same issue with 34
would you be interested in looking into a fix 
do you think you could provide us with a reproducible sample 
can you please provide a sample project that reproduces the issue the sample project can simply publish to a local repository 
does that make sense 
would you mind providing us with a ascii screencast https asciinema org 
does the behavior improve if you try v 40 v40 m 2 m2 can you also tell me more about your build environment os project type android webapp java etc 
can you please upgrade to the latest version and try again 
would you mind raising an issue with the buildship project https github com eclipse buildship you question is much better suited to be handled over there thanks 
could you follow the template when filling an issue https raw githubusercontent com gradle gradle master github issue template md also could you post a build scan https scans gradle com get started for your succeeding and failing scenario 
what exactly are you trying to achieve in groovy check groovycheck i am sure we ll find a different option that doesn t involve groovy meta programming 
did we already implement that 
which page are you referring to https gradle org next steps version format 47format bin has a sha 256 sha256 download link 
where is the plugin hosted you are trying to download 
maybe we can address this in conjunction with 5079
could you provide an example what you mean by deep search and how that is different between the two annotations 
would you be interested in submitting a pr for this 
does this happen every time could you provide a thread dump for the daemon when it s hung thanks 
when you have a chance can you give it a try and confirm that it fixes the problem you were seeing 
what is your use case why not make that property an output file outputfile since it is an output of the task 
can t you just put optional on a regular file property regularfileproperty and not set it our community slack or the forums might be a better place to ask this question 
do you have some examples of what you were trying to do 
can you please attach a small example project showing the problem 
do you see more information if you run with s or i 
would you be interested in providing a pull request for this 
maybe another task already ran with that particular global key globalkey 
which version of the jdk is this i m guessing it s jdk 8 jdk8 has this only been happening on ci or does it happen locally for some developers 
could you provide a reproducible example please 
did you have a look at that 
could you please provide the full stack trace by running with s lacasseio any chance you can try to reproduce the issue 
what exactly is test suites testsuites could you please provide a simplistic example in a git hub github repository that reproduces the issue 
could you try to condense your project logic in order to produce a minimalistic example at the moment i do not know how to reproduce the issue 
can you please add a screenshot that points to it

could you please raise the issue with them feel free to report back if you can t get an answer there 
can you please provide a small reproducible example project my initial assessment might have been wrong i ll take a look at the example as soon as you attach one
can you please provide a reproducible example project as far as i remember these locale issues were fixed in recent gradle versions 
why would it do that it expects a distribution to be versioned and as such unmodifiable you may also configure the wrapper to verify the checksum https docs gradle org current userguide gradle wrapper html sec verification of the downloaded zip 
does the problem still occur with the final 41 release 
would that solve the problem you reported 
does that make sense now to understand better the relationships between configurations i am interested in knowing the full extends hierarchy of both configurations named above 
don t you want to verify that specific task actions actually run 
can you please share a minimal reproducible example

might be worth doing for 511 what do you think wolfs 
do you need to be able to do such a workaround if the original issue is fixed 
maybe the default should be shorter 
do you have a reproducible example you could link to attach here i suspect that you re applying the spring boot plugin to all projects instead of just subprojects 
why exactly do you need to this in your build script or plugin i think it would be totally feasible to implement it yourself 
would you like to provide a pr after you find the solution 
would you be interested in contributing a fix 
what happens if you specify a classifier and run the build multiple times this might be the same issue from https github com spring projects spring boot issues 1113

can we see it i don t understand why it is showing the username in the bookmarks 
what web server php version are you using seems like a dispatcher problem based on the server vars 
what version are you running if you re running 2017 then i believe this is already fixed for 2018 i cannot reproduce this on the latest build 
can you maybe add a few more posts and see if you can search then 
how about now 
can you email us with connection details so we can test fixes on your setup 
do you have curl or fsock for php you can see if you do by looking at your phpinfo 
where are you hosting your vanilla and are you using mod rewrite 
can you tell me what your server environment is this in particular is very dependant on your web server 
can you reproduce this or link me to the forum that is doing this works on my install 
done anything weird 
can you provide a sample image url or the url to a forum where this is happening 
did you run your dashboard utility structure file 
can i get an idea of your server environment 
can you give us more information about your setup hosting company etc 
can you open your export file and see of the characters are at least in the export 
can you manually create it and give proper write access i think that will solve this one 
can you give me steps to reliably trigger the issue 
what do you think 
what version of vanilla are you using 
which settings are not working and do you get an error what version of vanilla server software copy of your config file 
what version of vanilla please 
what page action did you get that error on 
which version 
what plugins do you have installed do you have filed overridden in your theme 
did you visit the utility update url and get a success message 
can you just submit a traditional pull request 
what issues does this cause i have changed mine but kept the original line in case of error 
what do you mean by no redirect 
what happens after that 
do you have at least php 52 installed 
why not curl utility update via command line we do this a fair amount 
can you try disabling your theme and then try enabling a plugin 
do you maybe have a browser plugin that is messing up your page 
what version of vanilla are you using 
what version are you using 
what version are you using currently and in 21 it says gp lv 2 gplv2
how would you propose a php application install a cron and how will that work on windows 
did you try both the select file and drag drop 
what dropdown are we talking about 
what are the reproduction steps 
do you have any screenshots or examples to illustrate what you mean icon https user images githubusercontent com c c bbe 177005658111071c2941c807bbe e cac 11e98cac c dffb png 1c3202dffb26png 
what did you expect the effect of setting this property would be with the drop down date control that it would change the order of the drop downs 
can you share a screenshot of the working version for comparison 
how could we reproduce this issue 
what file are you importing it appears to be an html file given that error 
do you have any suggestions for how to accomplish this reliably there s a hacky rewrite closing parens method in the lexer at the moment but it isn t at all safe 
could you have done it with just a variable and a while 
could be incorporated by not that might be an option 
shouldn t this be symmetric to your proposed exponential symbol the nth root or something like that 
what should it compile to what if you add a colon after x so x 
how about code code then by itself it has no meaning  x 1 2 3 code code also makes sense 
what context are you using it within compiling it by itself on trycoffee org seems fine 
does that answer your question 
how would those suggested changes make it more useful for real projects how is it making it simpler 
can we dig up the ticket that previously discussed this 
can you provide more examples like the first one 
can you list any use cases a looks particularly useless and is ambiguous with a 
what browser are you having the issue in have you tried clearing your cache and refreshing the page 
how many times is this question going to be asked perhaps 151 should be hurried out with a fix 
can you give an example of the command you re running or function you re calling 
what does that do 
do you have a use case that you need them for 
could you rustle something up also do you have a proposal for what the coffee script coffeescript syntax could look like 
why would the code i posted throw an error in an older cs translator 
do you think that s better 
can you explain what you might like to see 
can you tell us a little about what you re trying to write is this for an inheritance library or something along those lines 
what did you expect that to produce 
can we add an event listener for an event that fires when an element is added to the dom if not it doesn t look like we can implement this 
how should we use them from package json and or the install script 
what exactly are you trying to accomplish here super followed by a property access doesn t really make much sense at least not without the missing class b 
does that not work for you 
could you give a concrete example 
what kinds of things would you want to do after the class body is set 
what s the specific problem you re trying to solve 
can you elaborate when you use require from inside a cs file it s just using node s require 
does it work if you remove the catch clause altogether try return new window xml http request xmlhttprequest 
maybe hop on coffeescript on irc freenode net and talk with him about it 
could you elaborate on what you mean by module 
how do the names conflict aren t they only referenced within the local closure are you talking about constructor name returning the same string for the two different classes 
could you give an example of exactly what you re proposing in terms of either java script javascript output or the existing coffee script coffeescript this new keyword would replace 
what java script javascript environment are you running in and what error are you getting 
do you mind writing up a grammar or something to better illustrate your suggestion 
how would but differ from and precedence 
can you post the compiled javascript or the cs source that generated it 
what exactly are you getting from gcc that s not readily achieved in coffee script coffeescript i feel that s the real issue here 
would you like this behavior to be changed in some way 
did you read the previous related issues  834 853 1087 1092 1283
does that help if not can you try to make your question a little more clear and or generic 
how would one get the result of the delete operation this operator has effects and produces a meaningful value 
can we see an expected compilation or two 
what about 
can you give a more concrete test case 
which version of coffee script coffeescript are you using 
what debugger are you using the ones i m aware of work fine without the functions being named they get the name from context 
what s so not normal about that 
what s your code 
can you paste the errant output and the input that generated it 
who is doing that 
what s your desired output 
why does it achieve something beyond the use of the test method 
what about using 
what is the actual problem you are experiencing 
what s the point of targeting llvm 
would black coffee blackcoffee https github com paiq blackcoffee work for you 
what s going on here 
did you try j 
what does michaelficarra think 
what kind of information would you want that to output the same as cake alone 
when will code window code be array like are you attempting to use code of code 
what else would you expect the compiler to do when given an invalid program 
what made you assume that the js you say you expected should have been produced 
did you not include the script that adds it this appears to have nothing to do with coffee script coffeescript so closing for now 
can you write some cs that actually does what you want 
what behavior do you observe when running coffee w the coffee files run once but new files don t run and modified files don t re run 
how is coffee script coffeescript supposed to know you re performing an assertion this issue is more appropriate for the node repo https github com joyent node assuming you are using their assertion library closing as invalid 
did you search for prior issues see 1165 many others 
what s your suggested compilation 
what version of coffee script coffeescript are you using 
why would you expect a bind helper it s not being used 
what are you trying to do fyi the parser is reading that f d  d foo 3
how am i supposed to know the plain old js equivalent if i don t know the semantics associated with the syntax you provided 
would you expect to have to escape a b in a heredoc string that seems obvious to me if we re modifying the delimiter we don t have to escape others 
why not refactor the deeply nested codes into a function and then call the function 
what exactly does that gem provide 
why the heck would someone assign var to itself 
would you expect to compile of course not 
do browsers even support that 
do you get that out of repl 
what s wrong with r i  0 for v i in r when not v 
what happens in the case of an inner callback like you said what s wrong with async js and stuff 
maybe it s worth reconsidering 
what you want would require a new syntax altogether  bah which would basically do on the soak expanded version 
would that make sense 
what flag is not working for you 
what are the consequences of it reporting the wrong version number it shouldn t be a very big deal 
what command did you type to cause this 
do you think this is a common use case enough to have a dedicated syntax for it 
what s your use case 
what s your node version 
how do single quoted strings operate differently in ruby with regard to backslashes 
why not update coffeelint then 
what would the diff in compilation output look like 
could you include the code as java script javascript between backticks 
can you confirm that this bug exists on jashkenas coffee script master as well 
would you disallow n then and just keep everything as is 
how is this supposed to be parsed 
how did you stumble across it 
does the same code work when compiled by babel 
why are you using cake install rather than npm install g coffee script to start with 
why didnt you try the latest version 
maybe you could try coffee react https github com jsdf coffee react  i ve barely googled but i think there are better solutions that just backticks everywhere 
didn t we already have a ticket for this 
can you investigate the nature of the errors 
how does it work 
how about this  where reads like function returning undefined 
how about with the latest version of io js and the latest 19 version of coffee script coffeescript 
what s the realistic use case 
what linter do you use 
what are you using use uglify js uglifyjs or esmangle also this should be on the mailing list not an issue 
do you have a mac i tried it with windows 7 recently and that was pretty bad 
what is it trying to do exactly 
what does that mean use a operator to define a function that s taken already 
what s the issue 
why should it none of these loop had any iteration because of the when so how d the value change 
did you try it out or just look at the code 
what would you have the desired behavior be every subclass is responsible for method binding 
what s the difference then 
what version of coffee script coffeescript are you using 
can you please post some example code that broke as a result of that change 
why is await promise all too long 
what s your coffeescript version 
what s wrong with assigning state in the constructor like everyone has been doing for years 
did anything change regarding that in node 12
can you try this on the ast branch we refactored comments in jsx on that branch i wonder if its any different 
can you find an example that doesnt involve another library 
can you try with the ast branch and use a proper ast rather than the call to nodes 
what are you using in what os 
what can we express with yaml that we cannot express right now 
why  they re properly ignored gitignore won t be installed and doesn t break any known convention
why not please provide more information 
what is the problem here 
what kind of subscriptions do your clients have and how many messages are you pushing through redis 
what version of redis are you testing it with the current master fe be 46 fe7be46 compiles fine for me on smart os smartos 
what is the full error given if there is a failing assert or alike thanks 
can you rephrase your question or issue i don t understand it 
do you want to return value is 30 or remove expire option i don t know what do you want 
could you please upgrade to redis 248 that is able to provide more information after a crash is this a real server or a virtualized instance thank you 
may you report the exact error please how ram is installed in the system thanks 
what do you see as error in the slave side thank you 
what operating system can i get shell access for 10 minutes thank you salvatore
how about using zinterstore zunionstore zinterstore list that you want it s implement client side i think that implement server side in a similar way 
may you try with it thanks 
do you have perhaps a way to simply replicate it thanks 
can you force a full recompile via make distclean jemalloc was recently updated and you could be mixing up versions 
what is the size of the dump rdb file redis tries to load can you try running redis check dump against the file and post back the output 
what s redis version same issue https github com antirez redis issues 290 and fixed it thank you 
did you tried if gb 3gb fixes it thanks 
what you are experiencing is very strange and is well covered by the test is the test passing thanks 
when did you download redis 260 stable maybe i think you downloaded rc 8 260rc8 it is same symptom when i downloaded rc 8 260rc8 try to download 260 in redis io 
do you use bit 32bit os plz try to add below code to makefile cflags march i 686 i686
could you please provide a copy of the file thanks 
did you performed a memory test in this box is the output really truncated to client list output and there is nothing more thanks salvatore
does redis start if you try it manually does it start when removing the rdb file or moving it somewhere else 
why are you subscribing so late in the process subscribe when the batch is created 
what kind of client are you using hiredis or something else 
maybe you can rewrite it and submit a pull request there 
could you please describe the network you are using between the two machines how large data do you transfer per operation you might have reached network bottleneck before redis does
did you tried a memory test possibly just with redis server test memory was the box near the memory limits when this happened thanks 
which version of redis are you using the return value changed in recent versions to the 12 semantics so it seems you re still using an old version 
might be a typo but is that supposed to be 6379 instead of 6369
can you share configuration of redis and host machine 
how can i share it 
can you provide a dump rdb does it crash without valgrind 
does it work when executing manually var redis notify sh echo 
could you pleas provide the config how much memory does your machine have 
did you set a maxmemory limit if none is set redis sets it to gb 3gb on bit 32bit instances on its own 
could you see hash data type 
how did you get the source can you try a make distclean make again 
can you paste the output of redis server if it crashed it logged it 
do you have any system wide access restrictions that may stop local replication strict selinux iptables rules 
what are the versions of your servers info server output 
can you describe your problem a little bit more it s not clear what happens and what should happen the log says nothing and the memory usage looks normal too
can you post the full crash log otherwise we can only guess what happened and this won t bring us anywhere
what system what compiler 
did you run check while the cluster was still being configured it would help if you had some output from the tools or more details about your cluster setup 
does this pop up constantly 
what version of redis are you running 
can you provide the full log from both sentinels btw you should better run atleast 3 sentinels 
do you set maxmemory in redis conf 
could not connect to redis at 1270016379 connection refused 1 redis server  redis cli ping echo pong 0 
can you describe everything you re running provide any other logs also see related issues https github com antirez redis search q failover abort no good slave type issues utf e c utf8e29c 93
did you check this against unstable  2157 seems to address this as well 
how about just using info command without argument 
did you try it 
what to do in order to make it simpler you can also use redis trib to do so and it will care about sending the command itself 
might this be related to 2612 is one instance explicitely bound to an interface that can t reach the other instance 
could you wrap the output and config file in
which version of redis are you using from what i see in the code there shouldn t be the possibility that rpush returns 0 at all 
could you maybe just give some coordinates would make it much easier to just test it 
what should it store 
would you be able to post the rdb file itself with the file it would be pretty simple to run this version and see exactly what s happening cheers mike
what about make malloc libc instead 
what bash script did you use 
where s the problem with simply sending get and ttl in a transaction or using lua for this 
did you tried make distclean before to compile 
could you kindly provide the steps you use so i can try to reproduce this thanks 
do you know replication http redis io topics replication if you already know that how about send write commands to all redis wink 
what command did you run the process inline buffer processinlinebuffer tells me the when args is null if argv null  add reply error addreplyerror c protocol error unbalanced quotes in request set protocol error setprotocolerror c 0 return c err 
do you have test environments where you can reproduce the problem if so we can work together in order to improve it 
maybe therealbill may have an opinion about that 
can you paste the output of info all 
did you have the core file 
do you have a copy of the file that created the crash are you sure the file was never modified by hand thanks 
can you add a specific formatter to the existing function 
how did you install it 
can you please guide me 
did you check the logs of all sentinels 
did you make sure you don t have any bogus nodes conf in the directory your starting redis from 
could it be some unaligned access if so there are fixes available upstream http antirez com news 111 but only in the not yet stable v 40 v40
can all nodes actually talk to each other on port 6379 as well as 16379
could you please paste the content of your dockerfile here you should overwrite redis conf when building your own redis image 
can you show the configuration of these nodes is the external ip the first one listed in your bind directive 
what s wrong with the above solution 
what error do you get what client do you use can you provide sample code 
what names are you using for registering your actual modules 
do you have the full crash output from redis 
did redis get killed by the oom killer 
why 
why not just failover the redis old master to slave 
what are you tracking  
what is your node app doing do you have vm overcommit memory set properly what about linux swap 
do you execute the aof rewrite command on slave node  you can execute it on master node then compare the results 
do you think just applying a pattern on the certificate subject dn would be sufficient 
how about attaching error logs 
can you tell me how to reproduce your scenario 
what operating system are you using you can simply create a systemd service and timer or a crontab for redis to restart automatically 
would you be kind enough to submit a pr to the docs that removes that warning 
can you elaborate on what exactly the problematic scenario 
would you be able to provide a minimal example to reproduce the behavior 
can anybody have a look we are working on a research project and need feedback on the findings thank you for helping us 
what kind of tool did you use if you use telnet could you run in with redis cli 
may you share the logs of the replica before it crashed even 200 lines or more thanks 
could you share the sequence of commands you re using or a simple script to try 
do you have sentinel pod placed in k s k8s and configured right redis s failover funciton is based on sentinel 
why do you think you lose slots i cant see slot loss in the log
can you please share a more complete example btw which programming language are you using 
what commands caused this inconsistency issue 
how does that sound to you  my works here https github com laixintao iredis ideas https github com laixintao iredis issues 6
can you list the elements in you list 
can you also check the git version of your redis repo git rev parse head 
maybe you may want to route this internally thank you 
why do you need this feature 
could you confirm with info you can check if the instances are creating an rdb file for the replicas 
can you give the redis log and coredump backtrace 
can you give the redis version master config and master log 
can you give the master configs in both situations 
what do you like more 
what platform are you trying this on 
could you give me an example that demonstrates the issue 
what was the resolution 
what broker transport is this 
why shouldn t it be executable usually this is the way initscripts work if the script is not executable it means the service is disabled 
could you please dump the contents of kwargs in task 2 task2
do you have any suggestions how we can solve these issues 
maybe you can give me some more context what os python version etc 
what platform is this

does it not work for you

do you think of a better way to distinguish configuration keys from annotation methods in the documentation 
can you at least give an example if the code you would like to be generated and how that would look in your proposal 
could it be that it s the raw types 
can you verify this solves your problem and that lombok still works 
can you give us some links to documentation and provide an example of a piece of code that displays the desired behavior 
can you give a code example of with and without your annotation 
can you test this 
what code would you have them generate that they don t generate already 
can you give that one a try 
does this occur in intelli j intellij 
can you configure errorprone to use jdk 8 jdk8 instead or use the lombok jar from the edge release https projectlombok org download edge html

can you try the edge release https projectlombok org download edge html 
can you give more information like a stacktrace or a minimal code that reproduces the problem otherwise there would be not enough information for someone help you 
can you test this using the edge release https projectlombok org download edge 
what would be the added value to final getters setters over public members

did you use an older version of lombok 
what version of lombok are you using what s the source code do you have a module info java 
do you get the same tooltip 
maybe the best way is not to fork it but help contribute to that project i m sure the plugin would appreciate a pull request or 2
what to do if annotation has target field 
can you add the whole file that produces this problem i can t understand what or where is your atomic reference atomicreference calculated 
why often you use builders in combination with immutable classes these should never get a no args constructor noargsconstructor 
can you at least give a code example what would you like to type and how should it behave 
can you supply actual pom files to explain what you mean 
could you try to reproduce the problem without docker or using delombok https projectlombok org features delombok disclaimer i m not a project owner

can you explain how this is a lombok related question 
can you give us the simplest complete pom xml file that reproduces your problem 
does this also happen when compiling directly with javac or with maven 
can you please verify it in a soon to be released edge release https projectlombok org download edge

can you please submit the minimal source code that triggers this error 
did you try other java versions 
what do you expect 
can you give us the smallest java program that demonstrates this behavior what ide you are using and the version of lombok 
what happens if you use lombok with instead of lombok experimental wither 
wouldn t it make more sense to ask parasoft j test jtest to allow for configurable generated annotations it is possible to instruct delombok to insert javax annotation generated 
why is to string tostring exclude not sufficient in this case 
should lombok fail to compile this piece or should lombok just silently annotate it with not null notnull and continue on 
why not use that 
what have i done implementing this generics hell

what would you expect j query jquery to do here 
does done do what you expect 
do you have some ideas miketaylr
could you create a minimal example on http jsbin com   micha gobiowski
can you put one on jsbin com or jsfiddle net and link to it here

what did you expect to happen 
can you find one 
can you provide a demonstration it seems to be working for me http jsfiddle net s kqg g 9 s2kqg1g9
could you post a concrete example preferrably on jsbin it s hard to guess what you have in mind when you re not sharing the code 
what would it do here s the current docs https api jquery com eq are you looking for selection is array maybe 
doesn t replace with replacewith do what you want if not why 
can t you just use serialize or serialize array serializearray i m not sure why the stack overflow stackoverflow answer is creating a form element in the first place 
doesn t it work for you 
why 
can you provide a test case on jsbin com or jsfiddle net showing what you mean 
what are you suggesting for this check 
how are you installing j query jquery 
what if you drop the accept header since a 204 has no content i m not sure why you d need to set that 
can you post a code example at jsbin com perhaps

what browser could you create a fiddle at http jsfiddle net

what version of wget is that 
could it be possible that something else is removing them from there 
why are you setting eval in leiningen to begin with 
can you please post to the leiningen mailing list ccw author is there to join the list just email leiningen librelist com and follow the instructions in the reply 
maybe when you write lein classpath you could emit a warning saying if you do a pull that changes the dependencies you ll have to blow away that file manually for now 
can you show us your project clj 
does it happen with piggieback only what happens if you require piggieback from core clj does lein compile exit with a status code of 0

why put a passphrase on your gpg key if the passphrase is going to be stored on disk anyway 
would it be possible to have a deprecation warning about dev resources if it exists and is nonempty and you don t explicitly refer to it in any profile 
could it be that you are using lein lein bat from git head please try using the released version lein https raw githubusercontent com technomancy leiningen stable bin lein  lein bat https raw githubusercontent com technomancy leiningen stable bin lein bat 
does this issue https github com technomancy leiningen issues 2163 help 
does this issue https github com technomancy leiningen issues 2163 help

do you think set the environment variable lein root to disable this warning would be sufficient 
can you specify which version of leiningen you are using 
maybe it would be better just to include a url in the error message instead of pointing to the help task 
however the intent is different so maybe it makes sense to treat them differently in terms of how we emit warnings 
can you be more specific about where you saw this broken link i can t find it anywhere 
does this happen when you are just running a lein repl at first glance it seems like it may be an issue in lein ancient

could you try seeing if you get the same problem using just plain webdriver or if the problem seems to be related to capybara 
could you post the complete stacktrace run cucumber with b 
maybe it s just a misconception you have about capybara if you can provide some insight maybe we can tweak that text so it doesn t confuse people in the future 
what driver are you using what version of capybara and please post the stacktrace so we can see where the error is coming from
which driver 
why not use attach file since it s built into capybara 
could you try if this is still the case with the latest selenium webdriver if it is we should probably file an issue with them 
which version of capybara are you using we saw this bug in capybara before 040 was tagged it shouldn t have happened since 
do you think you can provide a patch 
can you dig a little more and pinpoint the cause i ve reopened this for now 
could you explain that again 
could that be your problem 
what do you mean it runs fine you need to actually switch to the selenium driver for it to be used you probably want to set capybara current driver and not capybara javascript driver 
maybe you have something else called x path xpath loaded do a p x path xpath at the top of your file jonas
why not just use strings 
which version of capybara are you using this should be solved in the 10 beta 
did that help you 
maybe it s a regression with rails 31 very strange i ll close this issue for now but please feel free to leave a comment 
could you check your gemfile lock and tell us what versions of capybara and selenium webdriver you are using please 
why is it a problem are you doing something which checks the xml instruction or doctypes if so why 
which version of capybara are you using if you are using 11 try upgrading and see if that fixes it 
which driver are you using which server 
why would you want the browser hanging around 
did you mean to file this for capybara webkit they have their own issue tracker 
could you submit some kind of test case 
what do you users care about status codes 3 don t use capybara to tests ap is apis http elabs se blog capybara 34capybara and testing apis 
could you please repost this to the mailing list 
can you provide a pull request with you imagine this to be worded 
maybe i don t understand what you mean could you provide an example of a test which is slow for you 
can you post this on the mailing list please i ll respond there this issue tracker is meant for reproducible bugs only 
can you create a repo with just a gemfile which replicates this issue 
did you read the readme you re not going to get an answer unless you post on the mailing list
what is invalid supposed to do 
maybe rails csrf protection kicking in 
can you provide a test case 
could you check if this is the problem 
which os ruby flavour and version and capybara driver are you using it passes consistently for me on mri 20 and jruby 178 at least 
could be that capybara manages to click the link before you ve attached the event to it did you use a dom ready block try if using event delegation helps 
did you read somewhere to do this 
do you want the warning to be printed for all synchronized methods or only for some subset of them 
when you said that you had to fix some tests was this the issue that you saw 
what driver are you using 
do you happen to be using some kind of javascript select box enhancement that is changing the page structure 
what exactly is the error and are you 100 sure that you re running it with the selenium driver and not with the rack test driver 
what driver versions are you using 
what do you mean by doesn t work  hangs does an error occur 
maybe you should report it to ruby mine rubymine for an explanation 
what are you passing to wont have selector i m not clear on how it s even possible for e message to be nil
what error do you get with check confirmation terms agreement and is the checkbox actually visible on the page or is it hidden via css for styling reasons 
what driver are you using and what is the relevant html 
what type of element is the scoping element you are searching within 
what is the actual issue you re running into having rack env not be set to rails env 
do you have an example of a real test that becomes unstable due to this you can share 
what is the subject of your test 
what library are you using to provide the dragging behavior and how are you configuring it 
what version of the money gem are you using the latest doesn t appear to support to hash on money instances 
how do you build it are you using cmake as per our instructions i see you are building it under cygwin it might be a different environment 
what happens if you type gcc v your configure is successfully finished 
could you also narrow down which option is responsible for this 
does this fix https sourceforge net p uncrustify bugs 582 as well 
can you push it 
could you manage it for us 
how to do it with clang i wanted to compare the results 
what do you think about that indent cpp txt 2txt https github com uncrustify uncrustify files indent 629572indent cpp txt 2txt 
can anybody help 
may be ubuntu project have some build farms external projects could use at least they have s x s390x in their architectures 
should we try 
can you reproduce it by altering one of the tests like align 00401align equ c 
what do you mean by skip some lines  what is your expected output 
did you tried without the before the dump file enable debug preprocessor define to get the callstacks and see which line makes that decision 
what version of uncrustify are you running i ve just tried your example and it s not crashing 
can you pass p file to uncrustify and see how it tokenizes this example 
what happens if you add braces on else as well 
why local sounds fine let us know what you have done i would like to merge it 
which language do you use 
why do you say need can you give an example 
can you make a quick pr with the fix 
could you please push an source example which is compilable 
can you give more details about you expected to get 
could you push a complete example with use of it

could you add examples that shows when an break happens including your config 
do you need it 
which one do you use test it with uncrustify p info daten txt and report 
which version is running correctly 
may we stay there and close 
what are you doing with the result note that uncrustify doesn t know what is ref cnt refcnt 
could you give more information 
who is going to maintain them 
maybe cmake should check for c 11 support of the compiler https stackoverflow com questions how 10984442how to detect c support c11support of a compiler with cmake
where do you have got that uncrustify binary from 
do you have an use case that could benefit of extra safety 
what do you expected to get 
what do you mean isn t that file captured in a test file and ensured to be passing by our ci 
can you paste some examples from what i can see http doc qt io archives qt qmake 48qmake project files html they are very different from what uncrustify is doing 
could you use some more little strings 
how should i help if you push an example above different from the debug link 
would you mind looking at our implementation of shortest path distance to see why there is a difference 
what nltk version do you use could you please paste the exception 
would you mind doing this please

do you get a warning when you try these fringe cases 
can anyone tell me how to fix it 
didn t you find anything helpful on googling your error 
did you follow the instructions on https gist github com alvations ed d d e b f 9 0ed8641d7d2e1941b9f9 instead of using the downloader gui did nltk download popular in python work for you 
did that resolve your issue 
could you provide an example input the core nlp output and your expected output 
did u try changing the version of python did your pip install nltk run successfully 
would you be able to submit a pull request 
which nltk and python version are you using 
can you please check again with a different input and if the issue still exists post back here with more details 
what s your use case 
do you really need underscore to add a function for this 
which version are you using 
what about without array undefined null 
can t it help in making uniq more effective call inverse once then just analyze it 
what data structure would you get in return i can see that it would be hard to chain a partition method 
wouldn t changing this line  solve the issue 
what about a reference to the parent class for calling super  i m afraid this is a duplicate of 45
would you mind directing further comments there 
what would the diff be 
did it previously generate a newline 
can you clarify why you chose to rewrite index of indexof instead of modifying intersection 
do you think this should be changed 
does that makes sense 
which browser are you using by chance 
doesn t no conflict noconflict http underscorejs org no conflict noconflict solve this problem 
do you think it s worth adding where with this limitation in mind 
why not normalise the array first 
maybe it needs a check on splice property to avoid that kind of error 
where is handle elements handleelements defined how are you compiling and calling the template function in question 
when would you need to unescape a string 
what are some real world situations in which you need to know if an element in the list passes the test but any will not work 
can you test the different combinations with the closure compiler and report back 
what is the use case for executing it immediately 
why not just have a single render as your bound entry point and then a bunch of helper functions which are called in your main render function 
what browser do you get the error in 
what is wrong with set interval setinterval 
will that work 
which part would you like to contest 
how s that 
should we just extend to array toarray to also accept single values that would be too much of a breaking change 
why not just have curry with placeholder support it seems like that s what this method is closest to 
what version of node are you running can you provide a minimal repro case 
why underscore s escape and unescape are meant to escape unescape the minimum required and not intended to be a comprehensive escape unescape 
does a validity state validitystate object have a number value length property 
maybe a separate library but still i can t reason about this function
can you precompile your templates https github com dciccale requirejs underscore tpl
what version of chromium and ubuntu 
why can t they cache poll by default seems kinda wasteful 
can t reproduce it links to http underscorejs org underscore js http underscorejs org underscore js  perhaps try clearing your cache 
what version of underscore are you using this has been fixed since 18 i believe works in emulation mode at any rate http puu sh ov pvo ovpvo aa png 1222153aa7png 
why are both leading and trailing false one of them should be true 
would you like to submit a pull request to improve the docs 
can you include a use case example 
what d you have in mind we already include underscore on the page for users to play around with in the console 
can you explain your use case i ve almost never seen a good reason to use an array this way 
would it be worth to add virtual desctructors just to keep the code checking tools quiet 
can you check whether zeroing the memory gets rid of the warning memset info 0 sizeof info 
can you try to catch this crash in the debugger and find out the value of errno 
do all components of you infrastructure use the same version of mq 0mq it seems like some message producer uses the older one 
wouldn t that do 
how come the error function is called in unplugged state do you have a backtrace of the problem 
maybe it uses some other shorthand for 127001
can you please whether the problem persists when using master from github 
do you have any idea of what do errors are supposed to mean i believe the multithreaded use case is used quite often

could you please send a pr to fix it 
what do you mean by established can messages still be sent could you provide a minimal test case that reproduces the problem 
how does the client code looks like do you have a minimal repro for that 
could you please share the updated code on a gist pastebin maybe to avoid excessive clutter here
could you please send a pr 
can you reproduce without using cppzmq also it s good behaviour to close sockets before contexts anyway 
could you try and report back your findings 
could you run that under a debugger and break the program when it deadlocks and share the stack trace at that point

would you please send a pr including the test for it 
could you update to libzmq 425 i think there is reason to believe this has already been fixed 
could you please send a pr to fix it 
can you try with a more recent libzmq version 423 or master at least on the push side 
did you mean 413
can you upload the code to gist pastebin to reproduce the issue 
does free bsd freebsd support wildcard port binding ie 0

did you restart ranger after changing rc conf i know it may be obvious but i m just checking definitely works for me 
which default colorscheme is no longer inherited kitty s and just to be sure you have set colorscheme default in your rc conf right or no rc conf at all 
maybe it s your config if it s not your config i d like to have more information about your setup os terminal python version and about since when this happened 
what are you using it for if i may ask maybe it s a good idea to draw documents in a different color 
does it make more sense now 
can you try the newest git version it should be fixed now 
how about xsel o instead of another echo 
how did i never notice this problem fixed thank you 
maybe we can add a check whether the name clash is the same file though that ll mean redundant moves renames if you don t change the name

what have you been doing when it happened 
does this help https github com ranger ranger wiki upgrading
can you share your config h please 
when is this happening steps to reproduce run with ranger clean and test again 
what did you have in mind for integration though mark all the files that contain a match 
what do you expect to see in a preview do you know about a cli tool that generates one 
maybe copying the file so you could paste it is possible 
could you try an equally long filename with latin characters 
what are your  os distro and version  python version ranger version and are your ranger config files up to date 
could you check whether 1532 fixes this 
can you reproduce it on 181
how exactly are you measuring this 
what terminal do you use 
did you change your terminal s colors can you run file some mkv mp 4 mp4
do you mean running it with sudo the very first time or just after already having run without sudo

does w migmdisplay w3migmdisplay work for you from the command line

maybe this could be implemented as a new command mkcdir 
maybe w shows them 
which preview method do you use ycf 83 ycf83
could you try reinstalling python then reinstalling ranger since you re running py 37 py37 you should be aware of 1255
does the preview work fine if you move from a different filetype directory to an image is it the same for all image types

could you clarify what you mean are you talking about ranger s metadata construct or file format specific metadata like a movie s title either way i don t think it s currently possible 
could you check whether 1367 is the same a similar issue 
can you reproduce the problem if you run ranger clean that should run with default configuration 
maybe check the w m w3m delay setting 
do you use any software like tmux or some window compositor 
maybe running ranger in screen tmux d suit you better setting up a systemd service that starts that session at boot

what browser is being used here 
what version of chrome are you seeing that under could you provide me a link to the running j browse jbrowse that s exhibiting that behavior 
would you be interested in submitting a pull request that does this 
would you be able to send me a link to your j browse jbrowse instance that exhibits the problem so i could look at it directly 
does that do what you need 
what web browser and version do you see this on do you maybe need to clear your browser cache 
can you find a way to reproduce it on that j browse jbrowse instance 
can you try clearing the cache on firefox i think i have seen this before and then clearing the cache made it go away somehow 
maybe you are visiting the wrong url in your browser could you paste some of the messages in the error log 
does it work for you in the 197 demo on jbrowse org 
could you provide a sample of the gff 3 gff3 file and the website url 
maybe i should make it so that will show in a popup box if you click also i could make it scrolly and sorty like the vcf genotypes too 
what exact sequence of buttons do you press to get this to happen 
does that help 
maybe it was not fixed 
can you post samples of the data files 
would you happen to have a small piece of your bam file that we could check out thanks
do you have all dependencies etc 
would that work 
do you have a setup log it seems like it works on my machine
what server are you using 
maybe filter your vcf are you zoomed in to a very small region chome seems to still be the most performant browser for displaying big data in j browse jbrowse 
what is the altered behavior 
did you load the original gff with flatfile to json pl 
do you see anything in the javascript console strange that it would fail for both if you try firefox do you get any better results 
what web browser are you using has generate names pl been run 
can you check out the setup log file and paste it here i am going to suspect that somehow it did not complete properly
does that look possible i think the bug is fixed but some older data directories might be have that issue
does that make sense or are you still trying to use the perl scripts with the desktop version 
do you have a sample gff we can check out by chance 
can you attach a setup log file please 
do you have an example url i can test against i tried to create a test case by emitting a header with no value but i cannot replicate the error

can we see the relevant code that loads information into your link object 
what platform version are you on 
why would the html be written like that if it is i expect it to parse like a href test hellowthere de both in jsoup and regular browsers 
should it be improved as a whole or just add the default value for check boxes 
can you reopen if you can find repro steps 
can you start with a test case that displays the problem from your description 2 sounds like the approach to go with 
do you have a url test case i can t repro test is in https github com jhy jsoup commit be b ce d b ed e d eafde d 5be8b081ce931865d46b49ed44e19d3eafde748d
what s the use case 
can you give me a code snippet and a site that demonstrates this issue you re having so it can be replicated 
can you provide a fuller example please i e sample code using cleaner and the input and output html strings

can you submit a test case which reproduces this failure this appears to be specific to some detail of your configuration

which version of xapian haystack are you using i m wondering whether this might be connected with their recent 200 release since it s not one of the core backends which we test

can you submit a test which fails reliably 
can you provide some log files and which exact elasticsearch versions both backend and python client

how are you determining if they ve been successfully blocked 
does that solve str tweet id 
can you change this line in your code is retweet hasattr status retweeted status or text startswith rt to is retweet hasattr status retweeted status or hasattr status quoted status and try again 
can you show the relevant code tweepy does not have a post with media method if you mean api update with media https tweepy readthedocs io en latest api html api update with media this is likely something you re including in the status itself 
can you reproduce this from emacs q works fine for me in emacs trunk and c f ce b bf d e fcda 739760229c25979f00456ce62b0bf729d6e6fcda explicitly disallows company in the minibuffer not yet pushed to elpa 
does c 66678 3c66678 help 
does pressing return work for you 
why would you want slime it s for common lisp not elisp which already has a decent built in backend but anyway this one should work http www emacswiki org emacs slime company el
should we add it you can also try to set that variable to t see if you like the result 
could try try edebug ging through company files complete to see where this completion comes from 
maybe even replace its clang completion source 
what s the use case though 
which backend it used here look at the mode line when the completion popup is displayed if it s company clang which version of clang do you have installed 
do you get the message completion needs an inferior python process running 
could you explain the following then what is 
how would you distinguish them 
can you give a minimal reproduction scenario 
what about company dabbrev code ignore case and company dabbrev ignore case 
does that sound preferable to you 
what backend is used when this happens 
do you use emacs primarily in the terminal 
what s in your custom file 
what s the exact major mode in your message buffers is it message mode are you trying completion in headers or in the message body 
does it do what you want  94
what exactly did you change 
do you mean the third party package emacs deferred i m not too familiar with it but apparently you can use it to implement the fetcher https github com abingham emacs ycmd blob bf b dab f dedf e c b a f c c 98bf913b4dab1994f2dedf70e5c9b392a8f9c40c company ycmd el l l 106 l87l106
does c m i work for you then company should too 
what s your os emacs and company versions i ve never seen the behavior you re describing can you reproduce it with say company dabbrev try a text mode buffer 
could you give an example without dependency on pos tip 
does this happen in graphical mode can you write a step by step reproduction scenario starting with emacs q 
how will this simply work exactly 
do you have setq completion at point functions pcomplete completions at point anywhere by any chance 
what does company capf candidates da return 
what backend is it company capf does c m i show you the desired completions 
where does semantic completion at point function even come from 
do you expect completion to looks it works for me in all three cases 
what do you mean offset can t reproduce seems to be positioned fine 
does it or does it not work with m x company yasnippet i can t reproduce fwiw and there s no snippet defun here only def which expands to defun 
what does m x company diag say 
does it happen consistently how does that look can you make a screencast and or describe the necessary steps 
why do you think company files is at fault 
which one is it 
what does frame background mode evaluate to in the above environment 
could you m x toggle debug on error and repeat that 
can you reproduce the bug by pressing c m i in the same context 
how about following configuration 
could you try it out 
which version of emacs did you compile it in 
how do you get to that error message 
do you have a solid reproduction scenario does it occur when the backends are not grouped and only one of them is used 
did you call company diag inside a comment as well 
how about 
what major mode anyway see https www emacswiki org emacs test emacs syntax table emacssyntaxtable 
why not do that 
what should i do to reproduce this 
what is your sequence of commands exactly can you reproduce this with one of the built in backends like company dabbrev 
what major mode is this 
what are the buffer contents and what exactly do you expect to see 
what if your exit function handles sole and exact the same way 
does it have a similar effect over a couple of hours if you m x report emacs bug you might get some better suggestions toward investigating the leak 
how do i reproduce this e g how do i get it to suggest the current file s functions at all 
which usage do you mean in company semantic doc or summary 
do you encounter this case frequently 
do you want tab to apply the current completion or for return to stop doing that or both 
does you have its executable with different names locally and remotely 
can you reproduce that with org i d rather not have to install the haskell ecosystem to try this out 
what does m x company diag say 
however it will not change the tooltip drop down menu to the proper colors have you tried filing a bug 
what s the backend 
do you have a step by step reproduction scenario starting with emacs q describing exact buffer contents and so on i ve never seen anything like what s going on on the screenshot 
which option sounds the most reasonable to you do you see other options 
do you know if apple llvm 80 is still in wide use apparently it s based on clang 39
can you set lsp print io to t and paste the response for the completion request that triggers this issue 
how do i reproduce this please provide step by step scenario preferably one that doesn t require elpy to be installed 
which such modes are you referring to btw 
could you attach the file with this problem 
does gnu global support such declarations i e includes them in the generated index 
what does m x ispell check version tell you 
what exactly isn t working 
how about using company transformers 
does it always trigger this error any kind of completion anywhere with company gtags 
shouldn t shell mode entry have more parens for grouping 
could you post the contents of clang output in that case or at least a part including the lines with correct completion candidates 
what does m x company diag say 
does it give good results in that case i can just install it permanently so to speak 
what error and what does company clang version return on your machine the versions are not equal because apple being apple it uses a different numbering scheme 
what does company diag show at the exact position where you re experiencing the problem 
does m x completion at point work fine with the same settings did you call company diag on the same position in the buffer because it shows that company capf is not used 
does it happen with any drupal project does it happen every time if you have a small example project i can try it with that would help 
what happens if you just delete that line it doesn t make much sense 
what version of resque are you using why won t resque allow any new workers to register on that host when a worker dies 
how do you want to change it you can change the queue class variable write a queue class method or control how jobs are created using resque job create directly 
can you configure the signals monit sends term is by convention softer than quit but resque flips them because nginx flips them 
where do dates show up as na n nan days ago 
can you paste the full backtrace 
what do you think 
does this happen on every job for you 
what do you think about renaming the pre fork hook to something like startup that way it s super clear it is only run once

what exactly doesn t work for you any error messages out of curiosity why are you using open bsd openbsd 
do you have a patch or at least a test case that illustrates this problem 
do you have any other thoughts on an acceptable solution 
could you help me understand your use case 
would you mind writing this up as a test case do you have multiple generated keys per row in that case 
what version of jdbi what is the type of the argument is it itself an array iterable or similar there is explicit logic to protect against this case 
should we close this issue or are there outstanding improvements needed to jdbi here 
would that have helped 
would you do me a favor and open separate issues for each problem 
what database vendor are you using have you tried using a profiler to see where jdbi is spending all that time 
what do you expect to happen if the test no annotation testnoannotation method is invoked

did you install the kotlin sql object sqlobject plugin 
could you please post the stack trace that jdbi throws maybe the default sql parser in jdbi considers some parts of your queries as comments and strip them down 
does anyone have favorite templating engines that would fit nicely into jdbi i ve used mustache a bit and it was fine but i m far from an expert 
what version are you using this should be fixed in recent releases 
can you give an example what it looks like with jdbc 
what is the usage that is causing the error when you call the dao through a dao reference instead of h dao h2dao 
would you prefer the sql embedded in the log message be truncated in isolation or are you talking about other things too like bound parameters 
why do you want it 
can you verify that jdbi core jdbi3core and jdbi guava jdbi3guava are the same version 
could you please clarify what jdbi problem you are reporting the jdbi authors recommend postgres over my sql mysql for exactly this sort of reason 
could you provide a small self contained example showing the problem preferably in java it may not be as simple as just closing a context thanks

maybe we should log a warning when generating an empty zip file 
does it not work 
do you think we should separate that code as an extra module not tied to js zip jszip but to js zip utils jsziputils for example 
does that solve well at least in ie 9 ie9 your issue 
why would you need that install js zip jszip through npm and require it 
what do you mean by unnecessarily longer  i didn t tested it but encode uri component encodeuricomponent generated replace g replace g  should give the same result

can you confirm that the data on the client is the same as the original file 
what does grunt build verbose or grunt serve verbose say 
how do you manipulate this file in v 2 v2 and in v 3 v3 
could you check the zip files object in both cases you should have the same entries 
could you add the code snippet using js zip jszip 
do you have a stacktrace for this error 
would you mind closing this issue and opening another issue there https github com stuk jszip utils issues if your problem is persisting best regards 
maybe it has something to do with the following issue https github com catamphetamine read excel file issues https 54https github com catamphetamine read excel file issues 54 for me it seems to work with version 315 but not with 322 can anyone confirm this 
where abouts do you put that code 
what slider are you referring to 
can you please post a link to your site to the page that is supposed to be disabled 
can you please send me a link to the page that you re trying to implement this on i can take a look 
when it is loaded 
maybe the error message is referring to another issue scott
can you guarantee that your function is returning a proper result can you show the code of your function maybe it has some async code which is executed to late 
does anything really work in ie 9 ie9

do you have a use case for why we shouldn t double encode in most cases we definitely want to 
what is the issue 
what s the feed url 
what are the results of your compatibility test 
what happens when you enable error reporting error reporting 1
what went wrong when you tried to build 
can you not attach the source jars to the class jars in eclipse 
how s that

would that be ok i ll also add explicit logging to the class backed by typesafe s logging lib log j log4j  david
how s this going 
why is the max norm better than the 2 norm 
what did you have in mind simple replacement of the library or a larger interface change

do you know what exact versions of each of the assemblies you are using are these nu get nuget packages zip downloads or manual builds 
do you know which one is used referenced b i suspect this is related to the parallelization logic does this also happen if you do control use single thread usesinglethread first 
could you provide a simple repro somewhere so i can have a look at it 
could you also provide the complex vector that matlab produces for comparison 
do you have strict requirements beyond ephemeral serialization 
how much precision would you expect given the limitations of double precision format even 301030 has an error of 1020 with double precision and a matrix inverse has many more operations 
maybe mono behaves differently in edge cases if needed we can handle this and skip calling binary search binarysearch in trivial cases 
what version of the package are you using we ve increased the number of iterations in v 3200 v3200 so if you use an older version upgrading to v 320 v320 could help 
do you know what mono version this is 
does that make it clearer 
does this sound reasonable 
can you send me the contents of etc exports on the master node and etc fstab on a worker node 
what config are you trying to change i ve made a patch yet to be merged that allows to reload config see https github com datacratic star cluster starcluster tree dev config fcts or pr https github com jtriley star cluster starcluster pull 162
maybe you re running an older version of fastmath so with a newer version of py crypto pycrypto s py files 
how many nodes are in the cluster how many jobs do you have queued what is the expected behavior more details here would help thanks 
can you please attach the crash report that was generated from the output above it should be at home aravindan starcluster logs crash report txt 6065txt
what instance type and ami are you using also what region are you in i ll test this and see if i can reproduce the issue 
can you check your home starcluster logs debug log for the error and paste the exception search for incompatible cluster incompatiblecluster for now you can revert back to 095 with 
do you have the same instance type for master and nodes 
what do you mean it doesn t work i use this setting and it works as i expect
what version are you using see this line https github com jtriley star cluster starcluster blob ae dc ae e e d c fab eaea ae535dc2357ae0280e50e02d1c2fab334520eaea starcluster sshutils py l 205 l205
could you do this in a fork and send a pull request please 
did you annotate the index controller indexcontroller with other than resource annotation 
what s the expected result 
how is the implementation of a user class 
did you see the qmap qnoremap commands this remapping of the e key works for me  best regards xaizek
could you also post tail of the config log file after this error i ll also check it on os x tomorrow cheers xaizek
what version are you using this was the first thing i fixed since 077 release commit https github com vifm vifm commit f db d fa c c cbeda c db b 1f16db3545d9fa9c3347c01cbeda951c00db557b so if you build vifm from repository it shouldn t be created 
did you generate this file with version of repository that includes f cb 54f65cb or it was installed with an older version i thought it s fixed see 48
what s so specific about windows 10 64 bit con emu conemu configuration does it work in other configurations 
why do you use kbd p kbd and not kbd p kbd if you don t want to move source file source file is not removed but moved 
maybe displaying attributes of interest in additional columns would do 
can you show ls l config vifm scripts or just check that scripts have executable bit set 
would kbd n kbd just cycle through 01 and 03 or go 01 03 02 and then backwards in reversed order 
how do you want to use it currently you can get it in f if command is given range e g echo f 
maybe as commented out command with a simple example of how to use it 
what s does the error message say does it appear inside vifm or in vim 
does it work if you do bat c q on some file 
how did you check this i see js files highlighted in 091 with your command 
maybe always after a preview or running a particular command you re also talking about previous screen does that screen come from vifm itself 
do you have preview enabled this can cause trouble on certain files for sure

do any tests contain a require or include if so try moving it to a before background or setup block 
does the setup work locally 
did you add the env test env number to the test database 
may be the trouble is hidden in simple cov simplecov gem that you use for coverage report i think you need to try it again without this gem
would you mind submitting one so we can get this merged 
how about this 
why do you need seeds for every group if something fails you can reproduce by running only the failed group with it s seed

what do you think 
what do you think 
does that clarify sufficiently 
would you be up for working on a pull request to add this thanks 
do you have thoughts on explicitly fixing this or do you think working around it as per the linked issues is the better solution for now thanks

what about the other workaround i mentioned to schedule a forcekill of the pids that aren t properly shutting down 
can you provide a link to the example docs you are looking at 
what is your salt versions report output

can you give that a shot and let me know thanks 
can you give that change a try and close this issue if it is resolved thanks 
can you also post the output of salt versions report for historical purposes also it might be helpful to post what distro you re running ping techhat and s undt ch s0undt3ch
