doing that results in the same error although it still seems dependent on the presence of field u and the method call to get s 
dretch you re right i ran rustdoc without warnings being logged are you referring to fn doc meta in attr parser rs that looks like it would be a sensible place to do the concatenation 
i just filed a bug because the compiler told me too if you can t re produce then i really have no clue i wasn t driving deep into debugging it 
nagisa as far as i can see that pr would have exactly the same problem generally the source of problem lies in a fact that the calculation of new capacity is unaware on requirement that it should be less than std isize max which is checked only later in alloc guard gankro the gnu libstdc works fine in this respect it seems more like quality of implementation issue than some strong requirement 
sanmai nl look
sorry i meant to include the command line i was using 
my first thought was no because swapping contexts needs direct access to the machine s registers however we already have set registers and get registers written in assembly so we could probably write the swap function in llvm if we do this can we guarantee that llvm won t turn the call to set registers into a tail call like is happening in the c version 
yep this is now stable 
i was using rust incoming from yesterday
uint u 8 u8 etc are already a big exception to the naming conventions and i don t think that s a bad thing in those cases 
thestinger you re welcome to remove it if you think it s a poor idea my primary concern is that increasing the friction required to make use of options will simply result in them not being used at all and since users can t implement this themselves this is a decision that we have to make now 
not sure why i thought str unsafe from bytes stopped at nulls it s working as you described i m don t know why str from bytes adds null bytes to the string though it says that it converts bytes to a utf 8 string and nulls are not valid utf 8 which gets back to my original point why is the safe interface even providing methods for operating on byte arrays it s not like you can safely do anything with an arbitrary byte sequence so why not be more explicit and more useful and have from utf 8 utf8 instead 
i remember myself using get and unwrap a lot and cringing every time i did though looking back on it now most of the cases could now be solved with match move to replace is some and unwrap others would be replaced with oneshot closures i dunno i m not sure it s worth more language features to track in the cases where you actually do need to be imperative about it 
that s right 
cmr yes it does work so the extern mod extra line is not ignored but i still find the error message on use misleading ill update the issue title 
i can have a look but im not one of the reviewers who can approve p rs prs for merging into this repository 
petrochenkov i think all of your example except the repr c should be zero size i dont think its unexpected that a repr attribute changes the memory representation 
expanding the try macro 
jseyfried if i understand correctly something is inefficient but what needs to change to fix it is in rustc rather than in my code 
could there a be a fast er path for trivial static borrows of literals 
all the ll size of in trans machine for one t array there are probably more i m not thinking of right now 
that makes the function compile but it makes it quite unuseful for the caller it means that any caller of scan is committing to the transaction being borrowed for as long as the lifetime of the store reference within for example a function like also the error message here isn t great either first borrow later used here isn t really pointing at the right thing because there isn t a later use of the mutable borrow it s only required by the types 
the header being included is usr include unwind h the line that is throwing the warning is inside an ifndef free bsd freebsd directive i m running archlinux which installs the headers for everything i know that other distros often have a separate dev or devel package that has the headers 
whoops i forgot about this issue i don t think it belongs into rf cs rfcs i mean its purely localized feature for the rustdoc doc generator it has no effect on language semantic or am i misremembering and the rfc repo is about any kind of feature to any part of rusts ecosystem well thinking about it again i guess it would affect how the doc ecosystem handles writing examples in general but thats still kinda orthogonal since you still would use this feature on a case by case basis 
in the second step when i test for non existent opts i ve separated the call to opt present from the call to opts present because the former fail s as expected

i pushed a branch of my project demonstrating the issue on github drbawb aqua e dc 4 8e28dc4 you only need to build the aqua web crate to get the ice which has much fewer dependencies than the main crate i ll try to work on a more minimal repro than that but hopefully it s a start 
the code compiles with no problem when i wrap the rest of the code with mod block like

i was thinking that run would be composable with other arguments since rustc test already exists the usage for testing benchmarking would look like this 
alexcrichton my rustc is only 2 days old i can try updating but i didn t think there were any relevant changes recently that log provides nothing interesting the very first reference to either foo or f is the error this is emitted immediately after it successfully reads libnative pre 83574243011pre dylib 
it s garbage it points to the call to the intrinsic which is in std cast
oh that is a very good point thanks this is not nearly as obvious as i thought i was assuming that the data pointer would be printed but if you see any possible downside to implementing that then i ll be entirely satisfied with transmuting to trait object traitobject and printing the data field for myself 
to implement this change is it possible to just add the macro syntax extension twice once under the new name and then migrate all instances after a snapshot 
i m not sure and here s the reason in 19035 today s coherence rules don t allow the correct trait impls to define addition multiplication both ways what made me react in this bug was that the trait impls are accepted by the compiler but the operator still doesn t work 
not certain how i missed the existing issues when searching for it i suspect i accidentally had it filtered to only open issues ah well i still think it should be done but this issue is not necessary 
i poked around a tiny bit last night but didn t find a repo i d imagine that it d just be link against a ton of crates with a syntax one somewhere in the middle i can try to make another repro tonight

i am using luqman s most recent build for arm linux androideabi i am just compiling with rustc timer rs timer i m not sure if it s relevant but i am using a rather dodgy cc called by rust to link the executable my toolchain is gcc 440 i e extremely old but this causes linker errors due to missing symbols in libgcc which i fixed by pasting in libgcc a and libgcc eh a from a 460 toolchain 
you re right i ll try that next time i submit a bug problem solved please close 1
alexcrichton how does the link you provided relate to the issue as for example here it is http tplex cu cc example 16513example tar bz 2 bz2 exactly the one as in the first message sfackler yes you re right its a dependency of the plugin but i don t think it is cargo responsibility cargo is not an obligatory thing to use why does plain rustc users must suffer and after all it did work previously i just checked passing c rpath to rustc while compiling the dependency did help hopefully cargo will allow adding global flags to rustc soon

nikomatsakis i would prefer to have full deref pure derefpure semantics for box we already have fairly builtin move semantics and the ast borrowck semantics are terrible in a few places 
in the code that caused the error i am importing from a library i am building but if i copy paste the library code into the file i get error cannot determine a type for this local variable unconstrained type instead basically what i have this does not reproduce the compiler error 
the workaround was to have the null field be empty string instead not very satisfactory i ended up not needing the option field in my struct so haven t worked on this issue i just tried the latest version of rustc to see how it works now but got caught in a endless cycle of compiler errors that i didn t have enough motivation to wade through 
this shouldnt be fixed by 19413 i explicitly didnt fix it because i suspect its not going to be easy and with unboxed closures will be irrelevant anyway 
i can t reproduce it either

it s because the it doesn t ignore comments there is invalid syntax in the comment 
this is an if let bug  already gives you the correct error message but for if let it doesn t work 
it doesn t exist in the standard library that comes with the distribution 
arielb 1 arielb1 of course this cannot work i have a single use case namely to calculate the difference between the current program counter and the position the linker assumed the program counter to be in os dev this can then be used to create the page tables with the correct virtual to physical address mapping the advantage of usize is that the static doesn t have to be mut because usize is sync it s not that big of an issue 
this has now been fixed i think my initial installation of curl wasn t done quite correctly i ended up following the route described here to install curl http www multigesture net articles how to upgrade your mingw with commonly used libraries 
yep i have seen it a few times there as well and have been back and forth on trying to use incremental compliation on it i d guess the frequency is related to code size though as it does not appear as often 
these are on a different machine so numbers won t be comparable to the ones above   env rustflags ccodegen units 1 cargo incremental 0   rustc nightly 1170nightly eb d 62eb6056d 20170215 so a single codegen unit seems to help a bit but it is still slower than it could be i thought about codegen units briefly when testing but never tested it as the cargo docs seem to imply that they are already set to 1 https doc rust lang org cargo reference manifest html the profile sections yeah that was just my bad forgot i had it enabled when running the benchmarks would be nice if it wasn t a x 2x slowdown still but i get that might not be possible to improve much 
alexchandel the problem is that using where it doesn t make sense usually produces an error for instance this won t compile  so it s not very coherent 
well no unfortunately i need to be able to remove flags more over i should be able to set the right flags when needed not as a global declaration 
sorry for the delay i noticed what i pasted wasn t quite right and i ve updated my first post same error with latest git version 
i think frewsxcv is right and i also think it makes sense to expose those basic unicode categories on char since its incredibly useful for tokenizers and the like

kennytm good to know i wasn t aware of that this came up in the context of another issue and the sample code provided for that issue i do think it makes sense for this lint to exist somewhere and i m glad to hear that it exists in clippy i d love to see it in rustc so that it s available by default but if that s not desirable for some reason fair enough 
retep 998 retep998 interesting question the non native path types wouldn t necessarily be compatible with the native os string types which would make it difficult to reuse the code between them doing this thoroughly might require providing non native os string osstring os str osstr types as well that seems useful as well though also all of these shouldn t take up any space in programs that don t use them 
especially since we ve already gone out of our way to prevent other ambiguities https github com rust lang rfcs pull 520
bkoropoff yes this definitely looks to be a duplicate the small code sample in 17655 matches up with the code in dckc rust sqlite 3 sqlite3 that i eventually found to be the cause for completeness though 
i have installed multirust and then nightly via it 14 has been just successfully installed 
string str or something else but after deep consideration i think it doesn t matter sorry about that 
this issue happened by mixing the bit 32bit and bit 64bit versions of rust and and gcc 
i managed to reproduce the error in the rust play pen http is gd trqc f trqc8f i will copy the snippet here anyway 
these errors are fine the idea of this issue is to just make sure the code always fails to compile more errors are fine too the const let feature has a bug where even enabling it will still report it that s not problematic for this issue can you add a comment to the test mentioning that this test should never ever succeed if you want you can additionally try to minimize the test to something still emitting the feature gate error even though the feature gate is active and maybe to something that should be perfectly fine at compile time then open a new issue about that 
yes that s what inspired this optimization idea
steveklabnik i m currently rewriting a large chunk of the fulfillment context that i believe will make this a non issue but we should probably keep this open for the time being if is okay with you 
as discussed in the core team meeting alexcrichton was testing on crates io master whereas i was seeing pretty consistent failures on https github com rust lang crates io pull 869 without the workaround commit i added to that pr that switches travis from sudo false to sudo required alex said he would redo his tests on that pr
i only hit it as i was experimenting and didnt quite bother saving the source code heres another case i just wrote up 
rilut it should be copied over along with the extern fn rust interesting average block 
primary benefit is an ability to target rustc at stuff other than the list of targets we currently hardcode if llvm is not distributed by us linked dynamically by distro or something 
im telling what im seeing on my system it only runs run pass tests on one core for me and nothing else i e only one core is maxed i havent gotten past the run pass tests to see if the test runner would even try to run the other tests because i have test failures in run pass backtrace debuginfo aux rs and run pass mod file aux rs which i havent investigated yet 
relevant line is a part of does still result in the same error  for now i just specified llvm config for 32 bit version of llvm i have which works 
amusing i was not able to reproduce this on my recent w 10 w10 vm but im fairly confident i had hit this with the more ancient versions of windows closing for now as inapplicable 
a proxy is the same type while arguments type and return type are the same thus makes it possible to write a if while both arms are closures other than if match arms can benefit from it too 
the ice that i reported above is occurring on 1230 stable which is a little different and the circumstances do not involve rustfmt but it is the same line of code that s crashing and they could be related 
didn t work
does this need anything else to be a complete tracking issue this is a relatively minor feature so there s no rfc or anything to reference 
to teach people that instead of format foo they can also write foo to string this was motivated by https twitter com yoshuawuyts status 1051394862023495680
well i was hoping that someone could tell me whether utils is required for musl builds or if its presence in the linker flags is a mistake having looked into it it seems to be the case that libutils for musl is just an empty library but is still required in case we re linking with c code which expects to be able to link to it so probably we should be including libutils as part of the rust package 
it s fixed in later nightly closing i tried on a side note sadly it improved build time in release time only from 513 to 507 which even might be fluctuation 
maybe it is a cargo issue i was using cargo build but rustc worked fn main  
hm the contributing guide https github com rust lang rust blob master contributing md suggests that running tests on stage 1 is okay i suppose that all tests should always pass but the ones which aren t run on every pr tend to bitrot definitely need to try this with another llvm version still waiting for the compile to finish 
thanks for confirming and yes my bad i must have been too hasty in checking the src dirs here

lonami i m not sure i understand the question in relation to the proposal core convert infallible is an existing type that acts as a stand in for the never type since the never type itself is still unstable core ap is apis like try from tryfrom already use infallible i m proposing an unwrapping fn on result that is specific to dealing with core convert infallible and later when it s stable the never type 
yes looking at my dropbox while i edit it s the sublime plugin sorry 
nope no warnings were generated 
i share your concerns about this and i don t know its impact into into is already inline and a one liner so i wouldn t be surprised if it is already being inlined almost anywhere anyways i don t think any of my proposed solutions is good enough though those were only some of the ideas i had that could work and i d very much prefer a solution without downsides 
the thing is const generics don t know where the usize comes from so they could try to do something with it that is not allowed if it is just a pointer address until monomorphization we can t know if there is an issue note that converting a pointer to an usize and back just to be able to put it in const statics or use it with const generics is a real pain we would be better off in this case with an atomic ptr atomicptr t type such that i can write atomic ptr atomicptr fn i 32 i32 and avoid the conversion to usize for const generics c accepts function pointers at the type level and that works just fine with clang so i expect fn bar const ptr fn i 32 i32 to work fine as well 
alex that s right i have crate type staticlib in the lib rs but it looks like that doesn t get taken into account passing it explicitly to the compiler does invoke a different compilation mode and it currently complains with could not find native static library compiler rt so obviously i have to compile an arm version of that as well will look into it many thanks 
well i guess what i m getting at there is that in contrast to std prelude std io prelude isn t a set of things that are imported by default rather it s a set of things that are useful to import all at once it s a similar meaning but it s not quite the same thing as for where it belongs in the book i m not entirely sure either maybe a short section in the syntax and semantics chapter

is it possible to use cforce frame pointers off to forcefully disable them again if so i think there s not much harm in enabling them by default for these targets at most we ll pay for a bit of stack space since lr is saved slightly more often as well as slightly higher register pressure i think 
i have to point out that i ve only just started with rust so if i get you right i should have dereferenced tests last unwrap before calling clone and that would have been a compiler error because it doesn t use the clone impl s for t maybe like so let test test tests last unwrap let test test test clone

arielb 1 arielb1 it s a totally fair question for me it s about having a mental model that s simple to explain for how ownership works after you ve handed off ownership of your data like bluss shows the current behavior is a mix of errors and non errors depending on what you re doing i think a simpler mental model might be something like after you hand off ownership any read or write to the data will error currently it s something more like after you hand off ownership any read will fail and any write will appear to succeed but will not update the value you ve handed off instead it updates an invisible copy you can not read also any update eg push x or drop will fail

i don t think so items which have been drain ed and thus shouldn t be accessible have been protected by empty bucket none of the invariants of table rs are being broken which is where any unsafe code lives just robin hood hashing invariants in map rs 
msvc comes with a proprietary tool for producing lib from def and def from dll if you re missing the prior most other compilers targeting windows actually lack this facility requiring reliance on msvc s toolchain the rationale is twofold  first removing a dependency on a specific toolchain for instance a file with the appropriate idata section could be compiled with llvm and linked with lld without needing an additional runtime or libraries  second without this the kind dylib hint is superfluous since the behavior is identical to kind static at least when targeting windows i haven t tested how the behavior is when targeting mac or linux yet 
the as parameters and as return value tabs only return results that match the whole search text exactly while the first tab also returns items that partially match the search text because of this distinction i prefer in over as

before the crate change it produced syntactically valid rust code even if the semantics were different in the case of hygiene collisions this was useful for debugging purposes as nagisa points out since the crate change it produces syntactically invalid code which i consider a bug 
if i understand correctly the explanation in https github com rust lang rust issues 49596 issuecomment 378056770 with 49597 the proc macro spacing joint is correctly gone but there is still an incorrect syntax tokenstream token stream kind tokenstreamkind joint tree jointtree in the underlying token stream which is a separate bug that should also be fixed the links in your explanation are all in the code of proc macro token stream tokenstream from internal syntax tokenstream token stream tokenstream  so i believe only the proc macro token stream tokenstream has been fixed while the syntax tokenstream token stream tokenstream is still wrong

oli obk my crate is not public it has a lot of private code but it does have these flags on lib rs  i could give you a copy of the code through private means if that helps 
alexcrichton thanks for the pointer i ve filed it here rust lang cargo 3143 you can close this issue 
the successive nightly doesn t show the problem but i think it s still a good idea to investigate 
bstrie everything in libcore is also in libstd more or less libcore is just a smaller version of libstd that doesn t rely on platform specific behaviour at all i do think that libstd should be audited for types that can be moved to libcore this is just one case of that 
ok i implemented a prototype fix it s available here https github com joshlf once fork issue i copied the once module wholesale into the repo and did the fix there it needs to be cleaned up and commented but i ve verified that it works sfackler i ll look into the pthread once t question 
i have a library which is used to safely operate on memory which is shared with another untrusted process we have to assume that the foreign process may be arbitrarily modifying the memory while we re operating on it making normal memory accesses unsound volatile allows us to ensure that the compiler doesn t make any unsound optimizations with respect to reads or writes from to the memory more details here https fuchsia review googlesource com c garnet 229382

hi alex thanks for your quick reply i expected that the number of requested threads could be parsed out of the environment variable makeflags but sadly no  yep that works just fine for me so i run configure as before and then run x py build j 12 j12
i don t know one weird thing is that i had two functions  rustc told me that sub handle needed named lifetimes i satisfied that complaint request a request but i believe i should have been told about that in handle also and i haven t 
rkruppe i ve updated to the latest nightly on arm this did indeed fix the issue regarding the non releasing lock hurray tada thank you for the quick and useful reply for other readers bumping against the same problem here s the exact version information of new rust version i m using on arm that fixed the issue 
i was under the impression that the result tuple included a backtrace i now understand that is not the case and certain error types include their own backtrace functionality 
i m not sure it s an insanely minimal environment let me try 
cjgillot go ahead 
thanks yeah i thought it was mostly my fault i am in the process of learning but still found it odd that the compiler should panic in any case hopefully i helped through my own misdirection 
sorry i don t think i have it anymore by ignores stuff i meant that x py dist install seem to ignore dist install part and just does the same what build would do 
sure thing my bad if that i filled it in the wrong place 
what do you mean expected its clearly confusing from a users perspective 
this was a clean checkout but i ll give it a try asap 
there are 4 threads always running main 3 spawned 2 optional threads if i am logging data also i start the motors concurrently which spawns 4 threads for a short period of time this was running on a raspberry pi 3 model b quad core arm 
is there a supported way of using libsyntax as a dependency without using the nightly compiler i assume the nightly compiler will be broken 3 out of 4 nights here s nightly s error  cargo build all verbose fresh serialize v 000 v000 https github com rust lang rust branch stable f d f f3d6973f fresh log v 038 v038 fresh bitflags v 082 v082 compiling rustc data structures v 000 v000 https github com rust lang rust branch stable f d f f3d6973f running rustc crate name rustc data structures home user cargo git checkouts rust dd c fc b eb dd78c2fc2695b8eb f d src f3d6973src librustc data structures lib rs crate type dylib emit dep info link c prefer dynamic c debuginfo 2 c metadata a aaf deb c 8 0a44aaf343deb2c8 c extra filename a aaf deb c 8 0a44aaf343deb2c8 out dir home user source my project target debug deps l dependency home user source my project target debug deps extern serialize home user source my project target debug deps libserialize a ea c c d so 18a6ea8c4c6023d1so extern serialize home user source my project target debug deps libserialize a ea c c d rlib 18a6ea8c4c6023d1rlib extern log home user source my project target debug deps liblog fde c f 5fde67c83969596f rlib cap lints allow error e 0308 e0308 mismatched types home user cargo git checkouts rust dd c fc b eb dd78c2fc2695b8eb f d src f3d6973src librustc data structures array vec rs 14928 149 array vec shared new self as mut  expected struct core ptr shared found enum core option option  note expected type core ptr shared array vec array vec arrayvec a found type core option option core ptr shared  help here are some functions which might fulfill your needs  unwrap error e 0308 e0308 mismatched types home user cargo git checkouts rust dd c fc b eb dd78c2fc2695b8eb f d src f3d6973src librustc data structures obligation forest node index rs 2237 22 unsafe node index nodeindex index non zero nonzero new value as u 32 u32 1   expected struct core nonzero non zero nonzero found enum core option option  note expected type core nonzero non zero nonzero found type core option option core nonzero non zero nonzero  help here are some functions which might fulfill your needs  unwrap error aborting due to 2 previous errors error could not compile rustc data structures caused by process didn t exit successfully rustc crate name rustc data structures home user cargo git checkouts rust dd c fc b eb dd78c2fc2695b8eb f d src f3d6973src librustc data structures lib rs crate type dylib emit dep info link c prefer dynamic c debuginfo 2 c metadata a aaf deb c 8 0a44aaf343deb2c8 c extra filename a aaf deb c 8 0a44aaf343deb2c8 out dir home user source my project target debug deps l dependency home user source my project target debug deps extern serialize home user source my project target debug deps libserialize a ea c c d so 18a6ea8c4c6023d1so extern serialize home user source my project target debug deps libserialize a ea c c d rlib 18a6ea8c4c6023d1rlib extern log home user source my project target debug deps liblog fde c f 5fde67c83969596f rlib cap lints allow exit code 101

that would only lock up a single thread in the two examples i gave it s important that all threads interrupt handlers are aborted there s some documentation about the current behaviour of core intrinsics abort in the panic abort docs https docs rs panic abort panic 032panic abort behavior 
predictability of the behavior in some very specific conditions when i allocate 32 mb vecdeque i dont want to unexpectedly be 64 mb the current api doesnt let me to control this cause the actual capacity to be allocated is hidden in the implementation details now the proposed api would without exposing the actual allocation logic will give me the ability to make the code allocate memory more precisely 
i ve copied the std implementations onto godbolt and added the specialization as expected it improves the generated code a lot you re right scottmcm with switched branch order it produces slightly different seemingly better code with that and usize ranges it compiles to nothing u 8 u8 still has extra code that is with constant start end and step size i haven t checked the rest yet code on

slightly changes what we re expecting from the step trait in that any implementor must be fine with having 1 more add usize call than strictly necessary side effects it s unstable now anyway but in the future it may matter i m going to send a pr for the specialization is there any way we can get rid of the try from tryfrom baggage 
siddontang higher ipc is good if we execute the same or similar number if instructions here with lto it executes x 10x number of instructions but without x 10x increase of ipc that leads to x 3x increased run time ollie 27 ollie27 just tested it solves it another correction c lto thin also solves it i didn t test it properly before

retep 998 retep998 windows 7 bit 64bit service pack 1 i have update rust nightly version yesterday nightly just build and works fine my msys 2 msys2 bit 64bit working mirror repo https github com sailfish rust sailfish009rust
hellow 554 hellow554 yes nightly also panics
backtrace from gdb 
sorry i cannot provide the codebase therefore please close the issue 
ah ha but users before 130 can t use it in core i think it should get a new stable since tag 
i can try today in the evening but i wont be successful with a 99 guarantee as i am dependant on multiple nightly requiring crates such as relm https github com antoyo relm 
modified issue description it depends on fmt macros but the error is basically the same 
hellow 554 hellow554 could you show an example as far as i can tell when you import an identifier with use you cannot create another with the same name because that would redefine the symbol so if your code has use std rc rc you can write rc and if an error occurs for that use the error message could just show rc maybe some consideration needs to be made for how imports happen within macros that s not exactly clear to me

if i understand right that ropi makes the rodata section position independent yes however we have a double indirection here references contained in rodata are not relocated rwpi does not work i e when used by creating a static mut the linker rust lld refuses to link unrecognized reloc 
i no longer see this glitch on my end my apologies 
i dont have a test case i noticed it when compiling rust analyzer master branch on mon oct 29 2018 812 pm nick cameron notifications github com wrote

good man and i edited a little to pick up own mis types 
 i was just trying to reproduce it again but couldn t apparently the issue was that changing the flag wouldn t cause proper re compilation so cargo clean solved the problem sorry so this is now a re compilation issue for some reason in release it would always re compile properly when changing this flag but in development it wouldn t i m not sure how it behaves on other operating systems but in windows both dev and release builds produce the debug info as a seperate file obviously in release mode we have to define debug true otherwise there won t be any debuginfo to begin with cargo toml

nikic the git version is 274 so i upgraded git version 2201 and build completed successfully thank you 
i didn t give this a second thought but you re right anyways what i wanted to highlight is the idea behind the example 
not sure if i did it the right way i set rustflags csave temps ccodegen units 1 environment variable here s the complete target directory i hope it is included https dev gentoo org whissi stuff fd target 720target tar 201901252245tar xz
this workstation runs f 29 f29 with ext 4 ext4 not a remote location but there is a remote authentication ldap for logging in but i don t think the compiler needs to log in as another user does it i have another workstation which is again a fedora 29 fedora29 but no ldap there i did not try this code on that computer yet so the error happened again while re compiling my code it s very easy to make it pop out it happens most of the times what is curious is that this time the code is not in my local project directory  after running cargo build a couples of time it compiled with no issues and the attrs for that file are unchanged also i did a couple of changes to the code and tried again now some files in my project directory had the issue like home myself myproject target debug deps libsimplecss f e def f rlib 18f82e94def39f38rlib or myproject f e caecc c ol y xg ywg 6f031011e6caecc527c9ol3y5xg01ywg rcgu o but the attributes are the same as the one above 
great thank you 
weird yesterday i could reproduce it multiple times now i can t and i get the set same result as in the playground 
i ran with strace but i m not sure what i m looking for i don t see any statx calls in the trace but i do see a bunch of enoent and other failures it s hard to tell which are happening normally as part of checking for things i ll work on sanitizing a trace to post 
hellow 554 hellow554 yup here it is
sure thing here s what i got 
its also rather redundant in the context of a pre where all you need to add a line feed is  or equivalent i mean you re already doing horizontal alignment with literal whitespace 
i ve uploaded to my gdrive here https drive google com file d fjz kcp ac a w p b lc e e riis r los 1fjzkcpaca6w45pblc89ee62riis2rlos view usp sharing
the not a lot of code is at https github com th 95th btrs i myself cant reproduce with the same code now i tried cargo clean once and now it doesnt ice 
the program stops before it can print a backtrace and i don t think it s panic related because upon further testing the same access violation occurs even with i 0 which should be valid and produces no error or panic when run without the flags that being said here s the backtrace for i 1 without the flags set

in the get html function before return and after the sender is sent
that file does exist i m using python 372 installed via pyenv 
it was quite basic something like removing the await fixed the problem making a syntax error fixed the problem but guessing compilation quit before the panic 
sorry i misunderstand the rust rules it not works as i expected
looks fixed on the nightly closing 
yes but calling refresh before ever index operation would have a very high performance penalty hence not really a feasible solution when performance is a concern 
it works on single node cluster for me and it recreates it consistently i tried on 2 and 3 nodes cluster but it does not recreate it please use single node only 
the search request should hit document 1047855828 there s a comment in the curl script pointing to the correct one sorry about the verbosity 
ok it looks good now i reset my entire index and ran through the testcase multiple times and it passed every time thanks

thanks for playing around i m in the middle of deploying based on x 016x at the moment having worked around both these bugs using lats and lons in js i ll make a note to go back and try the mvel version when i move up a version for my next release feel free to close this and i ll reopen if it s still an issue then 
hello s monw s1monw let me walk through the motivation here lets say i am running the following query as you can see the score by field value factor is always shadowing the score given by random score as in random score has no relevance here my motivation for this issue came from this problem one solution would be to use the weight to normalize the values and that is how its currently done but then looking into the range of values for each function and deciding the weight score for all the functions and finding them manually seems like a hard case and these weights that are computed manually might not be applicable across all documents the percentage suggestion was based on this but i am finding it difficult to pen the maths behind the same only solution i found was to find the range of each score given by each function across all document and use that for percentage influence but as scoring is per document that wont be feasible let me know your thoughts on the subject 
jpountz i know this is being debated on another issue but i badly want the ability to decide if the filter needs to be cached or not cached with me itself depending on my client free or paid  his usage the volume of data he is going to search etc we make decision for enabling caching or not on the set of keywords kept in another document and looked up using terms lookup filter he is going to search you can think this for situations like when a client logs in before he makes any search we plan to cache his filter so that when he search the performance is good when he logs out we remove the filter too similarly we have other use cases too hence kindly make expose query caching policy querycachingpolicy via a flag or configuration or something or provide the pluggability so that we can do it ourself 
the aim is immutability perhaps i can describe our use case a little bit more in detail if we change the structure of the index the complete index has to be recreated during recreating the new index we don t want that new documents are added to the old index to make sure all new documents are added to the new index after creating it one option would be to disable indexing on all our servers but we would prefer to be able to set this on the server side so we can make sure that not servers add documents by accident and we don t have these documents in the new index because of the fact that shay mentioned in the forum i assume there won t be any performance gain

karussell i think its a bug it should be minimum should match if you send minimum should match  3 for example it works as expected the default behavior i believe its how it used to work if any word matches then it is returned 
i figured it was due to caching i don t have an immediate need for different modes but i was thinking of it more for an and mode 
nothing appeared to be removed actually it s just that the indexes seemed to have issues upon restart i did initially have logstash start up with elasticsearch embedded and try to multicast join this instance i thought unsuccessfully however i built logstash with es 0192 and not x 018x you can see the patch that i applied here if you want https github com arimus log processing blob master rpmbuild sources logstash amqp queuefix amqp09queuefix patch all that said if an index does get into a corrupt even partially state is there any way to repair it or do you just need to delete it it appeared that despite the log messages with errors the index was still happily being updated and was searchable it s didn t seem completely foobar d which is why i assumed there might be something to go in and do some form of consistency check on it 
so maybe this is a group discussion instead of an issue but from what i read filters are good and queries are bad when you don t care about scores yes you can wrap queries to convert to filters but then you have to know enough about setting cache options and such also its not clear if i am an ding anding multiple things if i can wrap the bool or if i should wrap each wildcard inside of the bool i m guessing i should have multiple query filters since those are cached separately filter  query bool should wildcard wildcard vs filter bool should query wildcard query wildcard also there are already some queries that have matching filters regexp for example so it confuses me why all queries aren t also filters there is probably some philosophy or nuance i m missing but if regexp has a filter seems like wildcard should also finally it just feels wrong  if there aren t benefits to natural filters then when have them at all couldn t everything just be wrapped note i m converting user input using my own dsl to json these aren t canned queries 
not really there are cases where we may see a little blip in the network that trigger the shard reallocation i think its a pretty worth while feature to say wait m 5m for things to settle before re allocating shards this is also useful for cases where you may be bringing up more than 1 additional node in terms of capacity 
if i call to string tostring on search response searchresponse i get a very big json which i have no intention or parse it ideally i would like to get fields as string per search hit searchhit only 
yes i downloadd it from github and trying to execute it directly i want to run elasticsearch locally to index stuff from my experiment app
i m using version 0205 cluster concurrent rebalance 20 node concurrent recoveries 150 node initial primaries recoveries 150 indices recovery concurrent streams 10 unicast discovery ping interval s 5s ping timeout s 60s ping retries 5 blocking thread pool auto import dangled no
martijnvg what s the correct way to check these values i ve temporarily disabled out parent child search but can turn it back on to get them using cluster stats shows without having run a parent child query in a while if this is the right way to test i can run it again both before and after running one 
i am able to replicate with another query without no 
i thought that s what this option mapping date round ceil true is currently doing to round lte 20140111 085216 d to lte 20140112 000000 i might be wrong though as i m sure you have more context 
nice support rm rf elastics if you ever decide to document your project i may look at it again probably not tip make instructions are typically put in the readme for us old timers
should work but i would argue it s still a workaround just like in is a synonym for terms es could automatically translate the query from match to terms the user doesn t always know the values passed are numbers or that the target field is numeric hence why applying the workaround would require additional calls and effort 
i agree it s not common but a valid case nevertheless i ve encountered this in some u is uis 
elasticsearch highlighting problem 0901 i am working on upgradion of elasticsearch from 0202 to 0901 and come across the following issue elasticsearch highlighting was working fine getting results as we expected in 0202 but the same doesnt work in es 0901 type pattern steps to reproduce the issue environment jdk windows 17windows 7 elasticsearch 0901 used elasticsearch head plugin to create query documents step 1 defined mappings and settings for index test hightlight type hightlight http localhost test 9200test hightlight post  settings  index  number of shards 6 number of replicas 2 analysis  analyzer  comma analyzer commaanalyzer  type pattern flags dotall lowercase true pattern  stopwords none    mappings  hightlight  properties  document name documentname  analyzer comma analyzer commaanalyzer type string  description  analyzer comma analyzer commaanalyzer type string    step 2 step2 indexed following documents to newly created index  note the same query is working as we expected with elasticsearch 0202
yeah the queries vary quite a bit there are likely over 100 unique queries across the platform we use them both interactively based on user initiated searches and also programatically to find various objects here is an example of a query that i recently rewrote to use the elasticsearch java ap is apis  when this particular query is run we also run anywhere from 550 other queries in parallel at the same time the reason we run so many queries in parallel is that our legacy search system was not very expressive so it was necessary to use a lot of queries to express some of the more complicated queries we ll also be looking into rewriting these queries to use the elasticsearch ap is apis in the near future i can also provide our mappings if you like as well they are specified in a single json file 
i d argue that just having 0906 is still not clear enough i understand that both 090 and master refer to documentation of not yet released software imho 090 should properly reflect that fact and say something like dev 090dev ideally the documentation would be provided for every past release to a certain point back current dev 090dev and master or something like that 
works now for me too 
running this on osx i believe i only have 1 version of java installed it is 17017 client is embedded es 0902 configured to run as client only with no local data server is standalone cluster with roughly default configuration aside from cluster name 
version  number 0902 snapshot build false lucene version 431 
btw third node is doing rebalancing too can you explain how best distribution for an index could change after another index is deleted link to an issue with discussion could help too my understanding of placement policy was evenly distribute shards between nodes taking disk space into account this way if index is deleted it might be a good idea to move a some shards if some disk usage disbalance threshold is violated 
yes i do is it documented somewhere 
of course sorry for the late answer the problem is that we can have quite large several mb 100mb data for a single field in a document so passing or receiving this data with apache http async client will be a problem because of memory consumption for buffering the object apart you could run in limitation like timeouts or body size therefore we are using good ol sync client instead of async and we provide input or output streams as parameter or response so that memory consumption is way lower apart at least in our case this is helpful we can use libraries that will process such a result stream but couldn t handle a data object of that size so basicly what would help us would be an option to perform a sync request instead of async and at least get an output stream as result instead of the whole object providing data via input stream would be even better does that make sense to you and would this be useful in a more general context 
sorry david i don t get you elasticsearch lang groovy is a plugin for es to have scripts running onver es no i just want a working groovy api http www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch client groovy api preface 090preface html similar to java api it s different no 
thanks for the quick response so big shoutout to bleskes too thank you no in my case i am actually after the precise offset but typically only of a few terms say 25 to describe this in general terms i am doing a distance based scoring for things in the text can i send you a prototype privately 
probably enough to just specify which cluster to use when its ambiguous
trying to index tv shows also using aggregations   first attempt using fielddata  this will work but now i have to educate people to use tv show a for aggregations and tv show s for searching i know doing this makes it even possible to use the standard tokenizer and let the user search for words in the show however that is currently not the use case   whishes  it would be great to have the ability to specify an analyzer specific for doc values something like docvalues analyzer lc keyword  furthermore is it possible to make a search analyzer work on a not analyzed field 
yes it did help me but i think this might be something that should be made more explicit 
sounds good however the debian package does contain an init d startup already so the script could obey settings in the default file 
how could i get a full stacktrace where the excception occurs 
trying to make up an hypothetical example here looking at https www otto de you can enter both some free text query as well as article numbers e g found in printed catalogs having seen nothing but the user interface i have no idea how this is actually implemented but i could imagine systems like these to have some logic in the application that tries to identify user queries search intents that look like article numbers and use a different template for retrieving results for that from the index compared to the template used for all other queries the only way to come up with an estimate answer to the question given a random user comes to our site how well does our search perform is to sample a mix of both queries for article numbers and free text queries being able to represent those as two templates in the rank eval request should make it easier to play around with how these queries are being translated to actual elasticsearch queries makes any sense at all 
javanna makes sense to me 
thanks nik 9000 nik9000 i don t know if this is only for aggregations but according to https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch guide current preload fielddata html global ordinals so if we update the index frequently and keep merging we don t really give global ordinals the chance to build up in theory then if we extend refresh interval we should be able to see the benefits from global ordinals i tested this by setting refresh interval to s 120s there was no difference in the response times 
that the process of how nodes talk about the election but we don t explain how the election itself is done ie which node they figure out to elect on 5 february 2016 at 0835 jason tedor notifications github com wrote 
maybe the problem is that i install jdk and not jre its the official oracle jdk installed via yum localinstall jdk u linux 7u40linux x rpm x64rpm 
elastic won t necessarily be running at the moment i am installing the plugin on startup before elastic is started my elastic config is all in code so regular cmd line won t work 
the exception message contains the response body which described what is wrong at shard side i replaced the error messages by dots in the paste the problem is not what is wrong with the query the point is we do not know where the wrong query is created at the client side source i will try the 20 later 
i m running 121 the strange thing is that my elastic search elasticsearch instance crashed running this query i got  i restarted it and then the query was working properly 
the escape hatch config setting had changed name from version 63 so the previous setting name was taking no effect one setting name for 60 to 62 and a different name setting for 63 this info has been added in the pr https github com elastic elasticsearch pull 22073 i understand the reason we only use metadata to keep checks lightweight and the expense at scale of doing a search across every doc with a script or something that looks for dupe fields one way to minimise this cost might be to use a random function score query across the data it won t be perfect to ensure all docs are checked but in the cases where all or a sufficient majority of the docs are broken it will at least alert the user in the cases where the dupe fields are rare then missing them at an upgrade check step might be much less impact the fact that the escape hatch is workng as expected means the impact of this scenario is easy to deal with if a user upgrades and finds docs are affected so this check might be added to an upgrade checklist in docs perhaps it s probably also a rare edge case as it takes a custom indexing app to make the error of duplicating fields and i think many of the mainstream indexing tools will generally avoid this 
hi martijnvg thanks for reply i will try the curl call later and maybe i could describe our situation more detail first we have an index named info which includes a type name message all the content is built into info with type message now the subscribe system needs to register query into a new index names subscribe as a type percolator and this works fine when we used percolator api the api curl xget localhost indexname 9200indexname type that doc would parsed typethatdocwouldparsed percolate d doc  message  a new bonsai tree in the office  the second parameters i would regard it as the type that the doc would parsed so here we set it as message but my question is how the subscribe index know the type message which includes in index info is that means that i should build index manually and set mapping with type message into subscribe thanks and i will test curl call today 
the source transform is going away in es 20 with 12674 so this is irrelevant if the transform reappears in a plugin then i hope that it gains this feature because anyone using the source transformation as it is today should make changes on the client side to fix the data rather than writing scripts that will slow things down to fix it on the other side adding trigger like support adds support for use cases that aren t possible otherwise 
debugging with the intent to re enable 
ekalgolas i was going to start work on this issue early next week and it depends on the work done in 35765 which is not yet merged it s probably best to find another issue

dakrone will send you a sample offline i think we can choose a default and also expose this as a configurable setting 
i am using elasticsearch analysis smartcn jar 210jar https github com elasticsearch elasticsearch analysis smartcn
it is happening in embedded node i have already copied the icu installation jars from my production set up to the directory from where embedded node gets started probably the issue is that carrot 2 carrot2 is getting started even if it is not mentioned in the list of mandatory plugins 
thanks for this one idea is to create alias methods in query builders querybuilders such as or something like  etc these methods would simply forward the input to the target method wrapper query wrapperquery so they would only exist for clarity if you can tolerate these extra convenience methods it might make it easier for someone to locate the method they need or maybe there s a cleaner way someone will think of or maybe it is just a documentation thing i found it hard to locate the method i needed thanks very much matt
hi jpountz thanks for your reply i don t know if that would be the best solution there is already a size parameter for query filter the problem is the programmer is responsible to do that and some times he will not understand what big size parameter in query filter would cause in production environment a maximum size in the entire cluster or index would help avoiding cluster shutdown but i think it would be better count how many documents are available and then cut off pre allocated memory that would not be used regards 
sorry ill have to ask again maybe im just confused  my problem i have some mustache files in the config scripts directory i know how to access them via rest thats no a problem but i dont know the name of the templates thats my problem is there a way to access the available templates in my case there are template mustache template1mustache and template mustache template2mustache and i want to get the 2 avaiable templates via rest without knowing they are names template 1 template1 and template 2 template2 if this is possible sure this ticket is obsolet and can be closed 
the main use case i have in mind is performing top terms aggregations or significant terms aggregations to do keyword analysis on the text fields of the documents stored in our index we use the default language analyzers http www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference analysis 15analysis lang analyzer html for these text fields 
i m on 131
i put this in under scroll because it has the closest functionality of what i need i have a setup where i need to query and receive back a fairly large data set then set up pagination within that data set i e only display 100 results at a time for each page etc the issue is the return data is large enough to where we can t really keep the whole set in memory and sorting the whole amount of data each time you query just to get a set number of results at large from values will be taxing on the es server as well so in my effort to fix this i noticed two things that were similar to the functionality i require one of those is a filter with caching this would just about be perfect except the setup will constantly be ingesting data and if those newly indexed items fall within that data set instead of at the end the page i e from size could potentially be different that s where scroll came in it as you said stores a snapshot of the index at that time which is exactly what i need only i can t offset what i want back i e start from a certain point because it always returns the next size worth of data until the return set is empty hopefully this cleared up my issue and feel free to ask any other information of me 
ok for now to use the timeout parameter with a very low value thanks 
sure jasontedor searched for an already created one but couldn t find it 
it was mostly simple terms aggs but also one global agg with a filter iirc the query itself was that same filter being applied to the global agg 
we are using cluster routing allocation exclude ip to decommission the old nodes we exclude the old nodes and wait till all the shards are available in the new ones before shutting down the old nodes 
true there appears to be a greater percentage of the recovery time is spent in the translog stage yes it s not 100 reproducible but it does happen frequently there are no exceptions in the logs that i have discovered since i posted this i done several rolling reboots and node failure recoveries of our clusters with 134 vs 132 a full recovery has gone from 40 minutes to over 4 hours prior to 134 i never paid any attention to pending tasks it s part of my problem triage process now so i m not able to do an apples to apples comparison when cat recovery does not show anything pending tasks will grow to over 2000 tasks while its stuck on a single task usually its shard started that wasn t able to allocate to a node some times i can cancel the allocation most of the time the cancel would timeout as well and the cluster is left in a limbo waiting and waiting 
brwe indeed it does blow up without the scale parameter i guess i did something weird last time thanks 
after thinking a bit more how about a simple mutable geo point geopoint class that extends an immutable point base class since we want to eventually support 3 or 4 dimensions this would give us both the read only protection we need for query state and the foundation for extending into higher dimensions without creating a class for each dimension like other libraries do e g point d point2d point d point3d this would be very useful for coordinate reprojection and rd 3rd party plugin support 
hi dadoonet here is the complete code that i am using to reproduce the issue  i am not deleting and then creating the index 
right now 6 m x large m3x2large 1 master 5 data nodes 414 indices index day 7372 shards 9 shards 1 replica per index 208 million documents 430 gb 15 gb heap size allocated per node es 142 current yml config here http pastebin com nmdr f j nmdr7f6j
yes i evened tried renaming the logs but it throws error saying this file is in use by other process which makes sense its used by es it self when i shut down es then am able to rename the logs manually on the unc path we are storing logs on unc path because we want all logs logged centrally on one path
bleskes i switched to trace the logs are below i kept the initialization part eu 5 eu5 the machine i want to join to the cluster is 1081147186 i explicitly set in the configuration
hi thanks for the quick response but once the refresh has happened across the cluster i should be seeing consistent data right but my state is this the st 1st time i get x as value the next time i get y and x again in the next run 
hi there yes 4 queries indexed in percolator gb 32gb heap size machine is gb 64gb ram available mlockall is disabled i m not using widlcard or regexp only term queries or script type size of array on documentation i saw all percolate queries are kept in memory i think it s the problem cause i m making percolate query with 1 or 2 million documents per days thierry gmail 20150119 2038 gmt 0100 clinton gormley notifications github com 
you are right it was the rss river plugin thanks 
sorry for the delayed response i am trying to search for a given string in the content of the file say i have a file abc docx and it contains the word shark in it if i search for sha it returns the file abc docx however if i search for shar it does not return that file i e it seems to process only 3 character search strings while doing content search i checked this in the latest version 150 as well and it din t work either this seems to be working in elasticsearch 142 please let me know if you need further inputs on this 
i am using es 142 i have set index routing allocation total shards per node 3 so the number of the primary shards is almost the same we create one index per day and import today s data to it every index has 89 shards and 1 replic also no search at the time 
oops i set index store type memory as you expect thank you for your advice
zerocoolys thanks for your reply the index configuration as below we are keeping the default parameter so there are don t taken effect index number of shards 5 index number of shards 1 index number of replicas 0 and could you please kindly tell us how to check the index status thanks a lot b r lance
possibly but it s not going to happen anytime very soon 
elasticsearch is installed from the supplied debian package on ubuntu bionic annoyingly i didn t cut and paste the exception and the stack has been dropped and the logs are gone i now can t reproduce this with this config this starts up 
eskibars thanks a lot i was looking for the same 
i like the idea of splitting allthethings 
sorry about my non response i will test it tomorrow thanks for your answer 
hi clintongormley thank you for your support we do not really use here either delete by query nor bulk ap is apis we had no fail over node issues in that time period we will try with upgrade to es x 15x and see if issue still occurs would close this issue at this point of time

shards and  replicas the rule of thumb is   1 having more shards enhances the indexing performance and allows to  distribute a big index across machines  2 having more replicas enhances the search performance and improves the  cluster availability   the number of shards is a one time setting for an index   the number of replicas can be increased or decreased anytime  by using the index update

areek ah that s what s happening thanks for clarifying and fixing 
dadoonet after install  bin elasticsearch plugin list  xpack clintongormley yes in fact i used to download the zip file into the plugins directory and tried to install it from this location path to elasticsearch plugins 511plugins i will update my initial post to indicate this fact 
we have 3 master eligible nodes and value of discovery zen minimum master nodes is 2
bleskes we set minimum master nodes 2 we have 3 master eligible nodes i cross checked nodes to see if they were pointing to current master and they were the cluster is not around anymore if i can get some guidance on what additional info to collect i can collect it and report back the next time this happens 
mmm it s weird i created the folder in backup es and now i m able to do it thanks 
s monw s1monw not using any special features i m aware of it was a vanilla install both are running on different machines i ve seen the issue twice once when testing what would happen and the second one when i had just moved to work on a laptop for some time then came back with it to the same network where the original desktop was i had meant to first back up the database in case it happened again to have a repro case but forgot i haven t tested since will see about finding a time window bleskes on the logs for that day i see it on node 2 node2 i believe node 1 node1 was up before i brought node 2 node2 into the network i may have restarted it after booting node 1 node1 as iirc i was running it from the terminal 
dadoonet version 304 full details below 
could you elaborate why you don t see a reason to fix the file 
i only have a local node i used the shutdown api and then started up elasticsearch i still see the issue however also thanks for helping me out 
imotov here s our problem in more detail we have a large cluster holding 9416 primary shards each of these shards has one replica in a different az we re deploying in aws we ve sunk a lot of engineering effort into a pretty elaborate higher level allocation strategy that ensures the indices that are actively being written to have shards evenly distributed across 4 indexing tiers made up of 24 nodes in total the problem is short of actually disabling elasticsearch shard allocation and doing it 100 ourselves we have no way to control where the primary shards are allocated we re already using index routing allocation total shards per node https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current allocation total shards html but this does not stop a large number of primary shards from clustering on a small set of indexing nodes if the snapshot process randomly selected between the primary or one of the available replicas for the primary the same way queries do today then it would more evenly spread the snapshotting load across our active nodes before you say it yes i know our use case is crazy i have virtually every pm and dev at elastic telling me we re crazy maybe we are if we re cognizant of our possible craziness wouldn t that mean we re definitely not crazy though hmmm anyway you could simplify this way down let s say you have 2 indices each with 3 primary shards 3 replica shards allocation looks like this  in this case node a has 4 primary shards node b only has 2 so during a snapshot node a nodea currently has to do x 2x more work than node b 
that worked thank you 
steeve mmm good point but no same result 
some users take es as the main storage system and keep like years data which is structed as daily rolling data in es as the archieve data some old data are seldom used but they will be used one day in order to reduce the cluster s memory presure i d like this feature 
so my cluster consists of 3 dedicated master nodes and 30 data nodes when doing rolling deployments i deploy to the master nodes first and then the data node i only see that error when deploying to the master nodes i didn t realize that master election is only supposed to take 3 seconds perhaps it is taking longer than usual for some reason btw i am using elastic search 171 also i am not specifying a timeout in the write requests to elastic search but my http client will wait 30 seconds before timing out i ll look through the log files to see if i can figure out how long master election is taking

yes i ve verified this on 172
in our use case we use the main query as a blocking step to retrieve good candidates for a more computationally intensive rescore function in a custom plugin running the function over all the documents in the index isn t feasible nor can we accomplish our blocking query as a pre filter part of our application needs to retrieve all documents that score above a certain threshold after applying that rescore function sometimes the number of documents above the threshold is large enough that i assume scrolling would be more efficient than paging at least as i understand it i admit i have not done any benchmarking to verify this assumption 
thanks that actually works i thought i tried it but probably screwed up something else in the meantime 
create index with mappings the score for the above query is 20 which i think is wrong 
elasticsearch 200 and ubuntu trusty 14043
i usually use a force merge or optimize because i have many kind of heavy requests which are index delete and update by using bulk these operation create many segment files and deleted docs it is inefficient to storage and getting slower also this operation use a lot of system resources if the operation can request to shard level i could save system resources and our cluster will be stable i think the idea is very useful so i hope you ll consider try again thanks 
jpountz i totally agree i ran a lot of benchmarks over the last few days until today and came to the conclusion that kb 32kb is indeed a good value i just wanted to ensure that we don t have unwanted side effects expect a pr within the next hour 
i made some tests about the behaviour of primary shard distribution based on the other users thoughts mentioned i find that there is no cpu or ram overhead on the node full of primary shards when making query or inserting new documents on the other side the only thing i found odd is when a new node added to the cluster the only node sending the data to the newly created node is that node which is full of primary shards and this behaviour makes network and cpu overhead only on that machine 
yes of course i cleaned it up a little bit
you right murmur 3 is not loaded  however i have done bin plugin install mapper murmur 3 murmur3 to install it and i just retried and it warn me that directory already exists what do i miss 
sorry wrong project indeed need some sleep 
i checked it with elastic 233 and that works perfect thank you so much team elastic is simply awesome
hi apologies for the misleading issue above i have finally reproduced with curl i had missed something from my mapping previously this seems to be cause by nested fields in the last step outlined below there are 2 results if the mapping for entity content entitycontent is removed then there are no results this is correct n b not sure if this helps or not but this is a regression from 173 caught by one of our tests as part of me upgrading to 210 steps 
no
yes i tried without our plugins we face some other issues like below note we are upgrade the 151 into 211 i just copied existing 151 data folder into current 211 version 20160114 error 155150734error gateway es f 101 f101 failed to read local state exiting java lang illegal state exception illegalstateexception unable to upgrade the mappings for the index medzo vendor thing reason mapper for payload conflicts with existing mapping in other types mapper payload explanation has different store values mapper payload explanation has different omit norms values cannot change from disable to enabled mapper payload explanation has different analyzer caused by java lang illegal argument exception illegalargumentexception mapper for payload conflicts with existing mapping in other types mapper payload explanation has different store values mapper payload explanation has different omit norms values cannot change from disable to enabled mapper payload explanation has different analyzer  39 more
ok i reduced the amount of data in my example as you can see each aggregation of each drilldown has the same exact value of 3001 this is incorrect it should be bound to the breakdown of each bucket within each sub aggregation 
this first example is from a get query  this is really inconvenient and prone to bugs because i have to write almost identical two copies of that custom deserialization code one to deal with search hit searchhit and search hit field searchhitfield and the other to deal with get response getresponse and get field getfield and always remember to keep them in sync with each other it would be far better if both of these es class structures implemented a common interface structure so i can write one common deserization method that does not care whether the document given to it came from a get request or search request my deserialization code should not have to be tied to the type of request that generated the data or even aware of it 
yes that can be done and need to handled explicitly in the conf so was just thinking if this could be made as info as this seems to be important metrics to keep an eye on cluster 
s monw s1monw sorry i could not follow you i tried the following this created the new index in the original location also i cannot find documentation of using path data per index
unfortunately being an es federal user i don t have any way of getting the heap dump or screenshots to you i will continue working it on my end to see if i can narrow it down further 
hi clintongormley you are right logstash sends the template to elasticsearch and it works as expected if i delete elasticsearch and restart a new one logstash never sends the template again or makes sure that the template is in place although it had to do a reconnect i can reproduce this like this  start logstash it will print an error that it couldn t connect to elasticsearch but keeps running start elasticsearch logstash automatically connects to elasticsearch once it s there and inserts data the template never gets written it looks like the template only gets send once to elasticsearch and only if elasticsearch is reachable upon startup i never observed that logstash would send or verify the template at any later stage i am not sure if this is by design but i would expect logstash to make sure that the template is in place if it couldn t send it on startup and maybe also if the connection to elasticsearch dropped and it had to do a reconnect i set template overwrite to true but i guess this only has affect if the template on the logstash local disk changed but not on the elasticsearch side 
dadoonet ok we are using elasticsearch 210 so not try it on 22
thank you dadoonet that is correct at the moment i don t have any instances running in the second zone this is my current setup the problem is that when a second zone is added to the configuration file the communication between the nodes is terminated i m using autoscaling so depending on traffic i may need a new node on a different zone or if traffic is low the nodes in a certain zone can be shutdown leaving that zone empty
yes thank you that s better my suggestions  add a link from that page https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference search 23search request fielddata fields html  add an example of a result set that s in general when you give an example request it is very useful to see an example response thanks 
ywelsch i have tried deleting it before but that doesn t work either only rebooting restarting the nodes tells me which one is stuck via the defunct java process i cant find my thread dumps from before so i will have to wait a bit and i will try to get you some elasticsearch continues doing everything else while this is happening only seems like snapshot and restore are affected 
nik 9000 nik9000 i will get that once it returns to a failed state again 
surely randomization documents doesn t work
yeah i mean we have a symlink but interestingly it can create read write the indicies but can t write tmp i have tried without a symlink fails the same way have you checked the kernel dump i ve attached to the original post 
clintongormley i am sorry for being ambigue what i meant was that we have deleted some logs from var log elasticsearch because they were growing at fast rate because of the recovery process as uplex paul uplexpaul mentioned we do have the translog ckp but not the translog files itself when you try to start elasticsearch with those indices it will complain that cannot start due to reasons that i have posted previously in my first post any help it is appreciated thanks
jasontedor thanks for the clarification i guess it falls under the community maintained docker library builds of elasticsearch from here https github com docker library elasticsearch the documentation for elasticsearch image dictated that index version created needs to be set which is indeed true as leaving it unset gives the same results as setting it to 2030399 kiwionly the plugin maintainer says the code that actually does the checking is in es itself and not in the plugin source i ve grep d the source for elasticsearch image and i couldn t see any references to requiring 2000000 values for index version created so i figured i d ask here 
it does remove the old library and installs the new one but attemps to load the old removed one 
version 233 and 3 nodes
yes i do have 3 nodes and i unmount only on the one i am executing the snapshot creation the same is not true for restoring a snapshot i suppose i e even if one of the nodes has the share mounted we can restore the snapshot on a different node where the share is unmounted 
234
yes that s correct i m using my own docker image which i have used without problems up until es 551
working on it just a minute 
hi javanna for instance it might be useful when you use the bulk update api this api call might take significantly longer that what you would expect for a normal search query setting the global timeout higher is not a good solution imho in hibernate search https github com hibernate hibernate search we are working on the elasticsearch support for the next version we also allow the user to set the timeout of a query this is used to set the lucene timeout in the lucene backend and the elasticsearch timeout in the elasticsearch backend but if we are using the rest client we need to be sure the http timeout is higher than that that being said i think you re right about the number of method arguments and maybe a dsl would be in order to be completely thorough i tried to implement a backend for jest https github com searchbox io jest based on the elasticsearch rest client the other day and i found that the jest client has a lot of useful options the reaper for connections idle for too long being one but there are a few others which might be interesting i think taking a look to what is done there might give you some good ideas that being said they do not support setting the timeout per query atm either

hi guys sorry for the late response after some digging the source of the issue was one of our scripts which wasn t parameterised leading to the issue mentioned here https github com elastic elasticsearch issues 19396
hi jasontedor thanks for pointing out 20640 i think that the suggestion works i m just trying to piece it all together the docs are a little confusing because auto create index can apparently be either a bool or a string depending on context to avoid confusion i highly recommend using a new name for the new setting that goes inside the template i e avoid reusing auto create index again as it is a string now or proposed and in a different location https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current docs index html index creation says q in the example just above the aaa would be referring to is that a regex to match an index name it would help to be discussing a specific example lets ask this to accomplish the desired goal expressed in this ticket what would be the steps the precise protocol to activate the no new index without a template step 1 step 2 step 3

jaymode deprecating json should be a straightforward task i would like to have a go at it 
i can try to get one but i think it s happening because my cluster is a little under sized in relation to the ingest rate i am more concerned about why the failure renders the cluster unusable i expect to lose data nodes

hi thank you for your help here are the new elements tlrx today i waited a long time and after a lot of time the process of the remove of snapshot finished  7 minutes on the test cluster 1800 snapshot and a volumetry of the cluster estimated at 600 gbytes  on production it doesn t finished after a timeout of 3 hours aroud 50 snapshots for a volumetry of the cluster estimated to 6 tbytes abeyad i see no logs on any of our nodes on we have log at info level is there some request http or transport api that can give me the process of delete of the snapshot i see nothing on pending tasks nor snapshot api endpoints or some log i could activate 
i should point out that there are indices which were created by that template and they contain data however i was under the impression that the template should only influence new indices not existing ones 
lets say we have a bunch of alerts now i want to count the alerts bucket them on the day of week they arrive and would be pretty useful if i could order them based on the day of week like monday tuesday wednesday etc and similarly many people would like to have their own ordering logic so having option to add such features via plugins might help this becomes more prominent when you want your kibana visualizations to show up in a specific order and leads to issues like this https github com elastic kibana issues 10543 which happened because of this https github com elastic elasticsearch commit b e f d b f ec f d b 961566 b01e3f0d3b35f15032ec90f2838d51873b961566 diff dfda f e a eb d ea e r 61 dfda7f92593222e55a117eb83d3ea89er61 on top of it elasticsearch being a search engine it would be very helpful for search results to be ordered via custom logic as well because you certainly can t cater everyone so why not give possibility to define custom ordering logic via a plugin

i actually only used sense and just copied the curl equivalents here my bad i ll try again with sense and directly with curl too to verify 
no problem and https github com elastic kibana issues 33218 is created 
rjernst aaargh you re right the indentation was off i ve corrected it 
hey jasontedor the master is running on m xlarge m5xlarge 4 cores and gb 16gb memory with gb 8gb of heap the warm nodes are running on r xlarge r5xlarge 4 cores and gb 32gb memory with gb 24gb heap none of them have any memory limitation for the memory nor cpu 
i can try is there a commit you could point me to it d help me get the bandwidth to prioritize this 
hi martijnvg sorry it was just a copy paste error i had the right description for that step but grabbed the wrong json block i ve updated my issue does it make more sense now 
the folder
the original command is wget q o qo https artifacts elastic co gpg key elasticsearch sudo apt key add with ansible it should look like this 
jasontedor same goes for get 400 bad request with empty response executing both get and head via curl against the es instance did just fine switchting to the basic apache http client with the same request url resulted in a 200 ok rather than 400 this was just getting more strange as i could not reproduce this locally i will try to get some logs out of the aws service by tomorrow i cannot access the logs today 
cbuescher thanks it s working as expected at first i didn t fully understand the flexibility of filters aggregation the syntax is a little verbose but as long as it works it s ok 
hi sorry for the delay the use case is a little bit articulated i ll try to keep it plain simple the company i work in is developing an analyzer which can manage among other things named entity extractions and structured text by structured text i mean a text for which i provide explicit sections structure like  we often have tens of different named extractions i hope this will clarify my request 
the failure message is 
hi jpountz thanks for your quick reply as far as i understood the keep words is set on the mapping but my application requires to have a dynamic list of word so if i use that i would need to reindex everytime i change the list of word i try to keep which is not good 
it s my understanding we use the non issue label for issues p rs prs that are small changes that should not be highlighted in release notes weekly reports e g stuff like this https github com elastic elasticsearch labels enon 3enon issue in the course of discussion jasontedor recommended we use this label as a way to gate the changelog checker as opposed to us creating a new label the at the beginning is a convention for typeahead convenience i think

thanks for your quick response sure here you have the stack trace 
you re welcome i started with the pr but held back once i noticed that one of the make sure you do x checklist items included creating an issue first please let me know if i missed anything or need to go about the change in a different way i m new to es so i may have missed something obvious to long time users 
astefan it should take a complete backup of all the indices shards and store it in the repo so that we can restore any index from that 
martijnvg thanks for the insight while using cluster state api would work the user could potentially have a large number of indices and we will have to look through each index s xpack ccr following index setting i think the ccr api is missing a key endpoint to get list of all follower indices and their status this will make our future ui enhancement work easier and round out the ccr api ux experience as a whole open for more discussion on this let me know if a solution might be feasible for 67 otherwise for 67 we will investigate the cluster state api route and or adjust ui scope 
i can talk to the endpoint yes via other tools but elastic search elasticsearch seems to want to go to a non regional s 3 s3 endpoint which is not what it is supposed to do i think another thing i noticed that since bucket names can contain dots https validation of s s s3s wildcard certificate will fail which is why i tried http as well to no avail i shall try to get cli to do an upload for me and will get back to you 
updated stack trace
so we finally got the index working elasticsearch 622 k 122k documents 6624 fields some of them are text fields with extra keyword fields so there are actually 13251 mappings  i will explain my use case but since things work with 13251 mappings it seems like elasticsearch shouldn t impose a hard limit i can understand making the default limit 1024 but users should be able to increase that i am using elasticsearch to do faceted search on health related datasets you can see an example here https test data explorer appspot com nurse s health study http www nurseshealthstudy org is one of our datasets the nurse s health data is a table with k 6k columns and k 120k rows each row is a participant each column represents a field eg weight in a certain year menopausal status in a certain year etc of course not every participant will have every field filled out in the index each document corresponds to a participant each of the k 6k table columns is a field on the document we want to use multi match to search across the column contents of all k 6k columns for example pre finds pre never premenopause etc cc bfcrampton
they would like a deeper history of the shard movements then what is provided via monitoring currently the idea is that they would like to run statistics on how es moves shards around and then judge how efficient es is handling this balancing they would like to use this data to tweak hot warm see if they need to add more nodes etc 
s monw s1monw yes sounds great 
hi dnhatn thanks for looking into that so quickly do you still need the log file you asked is there a way i can send it to your personally and not post it here i also wanted to ask k 75k shards for 6 data nodes is 1250 shards per node it doesn t seem like a very high number i have other clusters with the same setup which are working perfectly fine for months with roughly the same amount of shards per node is it possible to increase the number of open files could this help or maybe is it a fd leak issue

polyfractal thanks for your clear reply indeed increasing the shard size parameter from 20 to 200 gives me a more accurate result i was not aware of this limitation it is present but a bit hidden in the documentation so it is not a bug after all just for me unexpected behavior i think it is more fair to future users if the limitations of elastic search elasticsearch are clearly communicated in any feature page like the readme of this repository people need to make a decision which database to choose based on this kind of information they do not and in fact cannot read the entire documentation to make a well informed decision 
well that seems unlikely then
markharwood jimczi did you reach any conclusions regarding the retry policy 
yeah it looks like the same issue this has only happened to us once we re not sure what the underlying cause was because the cluster had s 100s of nodes in it and i think was in a reasonable state at the time
whoops yeah that looks incomplete 1 create a text field with index phrases true 2 create a custom search analyzer with the synonym graph filter 3 index something and do a query with the analyzer created above i m currently on holiday away from my workstation but the above should result in the error 
uh yes this helps a lot unfortunately this block you quoted is not part of the 56 which we are still using version of the documentation is there a recommendation how to handle this with 56 besides the obvious upgrade  thanks a lot at least it clarifies the whole issue
jimczi i admit i did somehow skipped going through the transport layer link when it was mentioned in the docs do you mean something like adding another info point with the snippet see attached picture i think that would is a good idea i would be happy to send a patch but it would quite helpful for me if you could tell me where these docs reside elasticsearch docs code seems a bit overwhelming to me as a beginner thanks for your quick reply remote clusters elasticsearch reference elastic 72elastic https user images githubusercontent com ac c cef 4801628605060382ac23c009cef e e d 11e99e9d c f a a 612c0f7a055a jpg 
polyfractal thank you very much for your answer but i would like to politely disagree with you you are right in most cases the client has the interval but there are also cases where the interval is decided by elasticsearch eg auto data histogram and i also know there is a feature request to have something like auto interval histograms in such cases es gives back the evaluated interval but it is not easy to perform simple key interval calculations because the returned interval is non numeric e g interval d 1d being returned by auto date histogram you are partially right in most charting applications libraries the key is shown at the center of a bar chart and not the histogram chart there is a slight difference between the two but from kibana perspective they both are the same because elasticsearch does all the calculations whereas for something like plotly js these are two different things https plot ly javascript histograms https plot ly javascript bar charts and if you observe the x axis in both cases you will see that plotly js labes them differently simply because it is confusing or looks unusual at the first glance does not mean that it should be represented incorrectly even in my example i am working with discrete values and it took me sometime to realize that something was going wrong especially when applying filters i did clarify that previously but i can elaborate again the value 6 is the start of the bucket but it is show at the center of the bucket where it should say 65 or if you want to adpot from plotlyjs histogram it should say 67 i see only two options 1 shifting 6 to the start of the bin this is a less preferred option as this would only solve the problem for kibana but if someone is using someother charting library these libraries always put the value at the center of bin and they dont have a flag to shift the value to the start 2 return the average center 65 of the bin from elasticsearch this is preferrable as this will work out of the box with kibana and also with other client side frameworks also this will be visually more appealing except for the people working with discrete values i guess haha as it will be at the center of the bar which is how most people are used to seeing both bar and histogram charts thank you very much for your consideration and pacience in reading my long explaination looking forward to your comments 
creating a simple rollup job on kibana ui below the json 
hi tlrx thank you for your fast reply i m fine with that and create a new issue at the suggested place
the difference is the api key would be a privilege snapshot of the target user not a privilege snapshot of the user who is making the request to elasticsearch the idea is an internal kibana system user which has very limited privileges it only has read write access to the system indices it needs to operate could take create an api key of the end user logged into kibana who will have privileges to data they want to run background jobs on when they request a background job to be created and run the api key should represent the target user permissions so yes there s risk that the requesting user captures that key and now has expanded privileges that s one way to look at what the internal kibana system user would be doing but this action must be initiated by the target authenticated user with the intent of creating a background task owned by that target user in general we want users to have api keys but not require users to be able to create their own api keys cc mikecote tvernum
yes i m very sorry
sure will do thank you 
i m using kibana for searching and in the response result i see one extra which is breaking the process 
i ve attached the output if any params should be adjusted when running that endpoint please let me know thank you hot threads txt https github com elastic elasticsearch files hot 4243547hot threads txt

sorry i forgot the when trying the new version with the new version it works sorry here s the verbose output but as far as i can see there s no difference  shouldn t that be escaped for the case that signature contains percent signs s and the like 
kamil pyrkosz 97 kamilpyrkosz97 they have closed it i did send an e mail to dstftw but he hasn t got back to me as of yet so don t think it will get fixed any time soonish 
unfortunately i cannot replicate the problem 
my theory as you refer to it is a bug report that was requested by an error message in the program s output the title of the bug report is the youtube dl exe and python version s do not work the same i go on to show an example where the same command for the same video when used on the two versions of the programs produces different results it is no theory it is a fact that is demonstrated you say the exe gets a proxy set whereas the python version does not thus you agree there is a difference in the way the two programs work it you did not need to know about this that is ok but i do not accuse you of being in a conspiracy this is my first bug report here i was doing as requested and trying to help it is unfortunate that this was spam i won t spam you again sorry for your trouble to read this bye 
didn t know that thx for clarification 
dstftw no i can t but http www downforeveryoneorjustme com planetaplay com show it is up and scivee tv and dump com unavailable too

that ffmpeg thread is 7 month old i guess this ain t happening any soon i guess you can close it 
its not the url i m trying to download that is blocking me it is my dns server that blocks me when there are too many dns requests happening when youtube dl is running and trying to guess a quality for the video its downloading

of course sorry url youtube dl http www youtube com watch v brbx wo mpwfs brbxwompwfs country usa
oh yes it works fine this time 1 thanks 
okay thanks for your quick reply the goal is that once the you have extracted the video information from youtube for example in a json file there is no need to roundtrip to youtube again just to download the video file i would be a nice to have to instruct youtube dl to use a json file with the extracted video information

when i update youtube dl then it definitely works may i know the reason why does it happen same video is working before in old version and suddenly it stops working youtube make some changes at there end so you also have to update youtube dl almost everyday 
happens with every f m f4m video i have ever downloaded but in the spirit of the day i will offer this link http www nbcsports com horse racing american pharoah ends year 37year triple crown drought
i m searching for it in the google chrome console using javascript  as you can see i have sig instead of the s parameter if it s dependent on the country then we have found something good because i searched a lot of videos that are submitted in the issues about the encrypted signatures and with all of them i didn t get a single encrypted signature always the sig which is not encrypted

yes that would be great thank you 
no verbose option cant fix my problem because my playlist have many video 200 300 video i downloaded with youtube dl and i go to bed i dont know what video have error because output is too long thank you for your comment
perhaps something like  mb 5mb total bandwidth usage video 1 mb 20 page download 1 mb 20 json requests 1 mb 20 http request overhead 2 mb 40 download efficiency 20 1 mb of 5 mb estimated bandwidth usage 200 mb for file size 40 mb above are just dummy values perhaps the user can have control of what is printed would be the best option if the provides a cost per byte kb mb gb etc you can print the estimated cost of downloading the file also the play list 
just thought this might be a bug since i get this on the same files in the play list 
c downloads youtube dl u updating to version 201402221 waiting for file handle to be closed 
going through my logs the last video i saw with k 256k was this one on th 7th december not sure which version of youtube dl it would have been but definitely pretty current http www youtube com watch v fza ct ybi sm a fzactybisma as pulpe says it was the 141 itag 
yes i can load the video in my browser it s weird you can t
i have tried the 201401271 version and it works indeed the issue can be closed big thanks for the tallented people who fix services the other people made crippled 
sorry been out of town for a while it definitely works now but that is probably of no help 
http en wikipedia org wiki symbolic link take this youtube account https www youtube com channel ucc pet h gyyi lqb m arojegy a uccpethgyyi1lqbmarojegya now if i record it with just the channel id i won t really remember who it was but the channel name can change over time it would be nice if it did something like ln s channel id channel

avconv version ffmpeg version saucy 1 010127010121saucy1 yes it did work what did you do was there something wrong with the md sum md5sum or video i would like to know for future full hd tests i also noticed the file size was remarkably 97 mb rather than mb 350mb 
i just searched for examples of rtmpdump used with livestream com got the parameters off some forum post heh sorry that s all i got 
wow yes you re right after updating the output is perfectly descriptive i was sure i updated yesterday but my memory must be failing me sorry 
unfortunately i was a tad overzealous posting this bug report and actually found the other reports faq update instructions almost immediately after my sincere apologies for the duplicate issue 
thanks

yes i can https vine co v o b prl ta jk o6b6prltajk when i download it as i stated in the op it uses the description of the video rather than what it would use in previous versions if i still was using an older version it would ve downloaded it as josh peck s post on vine it 123128312831230it usually sticks in random numbers after vine mp 4 mp4 but it downloads as when haters hate ya just gotta shake it off king bach kingbach christian del grosso delgrosso curtis lepore o b prl ta jk o6b6prltajk mp 4 mp4 or is there perhaps a way to just download a viner s vines and skip over the revines if not then back to what i was saying then it was just much easier for me to delete the revines via linuxs terminal with the previous versions thanks for replying btw

win r typed cmd and pressed enter then i installed youtube dl via chocolatey then ran the command to download a video it ended up in sys wow 64 syswow64 rebooting would fix that and i guess restarting the cmd would too after closing and reopening cmd it works as expected on thu dec 11 2014 at 116 pm philipp hagemeister notifications github com wrote   best regards rory
speaking of randomly cranky software i d gladly maintain a fork of mplayer that supports ssl something like mplayer ssl but at the moment i have no idea how to add the functionality once it exists the only task would be to patch each new official release strange that the developers of mplayer haven t bothered to figure out something like this by now ssl support is worthwhile functionality to add even if it means a substantial refactoring of existing code 
same for several other videos https www youtube com watch v emc hz wzgq 2hzwzgq https www youtube com watch v y ys oqz gp yys5oqzgp o all are x 1920 1080x1920 vp 9 vp9 video and aac audio and therefore were merged as mkv when youtube dl downloads the avc version and merged as mp 4 mp4 it s ok

try this one https www gloria tv video byq r wex m h byq2rwexm9h
at line 39 of your readme md file https github com rg youtube rg3youtube dl blob master readme md 
it seems it is working today no broken problem but still only part of the whole video is downloaded for the link above the downloaded video in flv format is only 6 minutes long though it should be approx 20 minutes i put the dump files in a single gist at https gist github com shichao an e eaf fec ad a 03e49eaf02fec307ad1a
as indicated in the logs above yes i ve tried using the no check certificate option in vain 
yes i am running the latest version i did youtube dl u yesterday to update the application it failed on various videos already but here s an example of a video that didn t reliably download https www youtube com watch v i bx vdm xsi y i5bxvdmxsiy note that it might not be reproducible since the failures are quite random but big videos usually are more critical maybe data downloads incorrectly by coincidence thank you
i wasn t aware of that feature and i ve read readme md great to know many thanks 
tried multiple ur ls urls you may use this as an example http vk com video 84761705171277495
nope i am using download archive it s in the default config file for me some videos in the playlist i have are of no interest to me i want to see what videos are in the playlist and decide which to download if a video is in the playlist and in the download archive list file then it won t even be attempted and i won t see a filename for it so if i am counting filenames i won t have the right playlist index entirely separate why am i not getting notices when a response to my posts here come in 
it seems like the main difference from https trac ffmpeg org ticket 2221 and what s in embedthumbnail py is that embedthumbnail py doesn t have the option id v version id3v2version 3
i don t have a specific link at the moment but earlier on my windows machine some videos wouldn t download at the highest available quality until i was told that i have to download ffmpeg so on my mac machine i downloaded ffmpeg in order not to have the previous issue however i ended up getting that warning in my first post so i removed ffmpeg on my mac and now videos are downloaded in mp 4 mp4 again so yea what should i do in order for me to download the best video quality as well as in mp 4 mp4 format i want to avoid mkv or any non mp 4 mp4 formats while having the best video quality possible 
i ve done that and uploaded to a file sharing service i found on google here s the link http s tinyupload s000tinyupload com index php file id 50497864888814330087
apologies for the url 
dstftw yes i am a resident of the u s the only main country likely to be supported by this section of the website if any geo restrictions are in place and a windows rig i have running on this ip is capable of successfully streaming the videos in browser 
yes when you go to the website the video does play
yan 12125 yan12125 i ll close this issue and open a new issue if ac c 358 ac6c358 fails thanks 
hi yan thanks for the response it s occurred randomly like this one happened after a few videos then succeed after a few time retry youtube dl exe o y youtube title s ext s https www youtube com user kos videos kos44444videos
alex ayyy desktop youtube dl http www liveleak com view i 4801430856831 live leak liveleak 4801430856831 downloading webpage error unable to download video data urlopen error errno 8 ssl c 510 eof occurred in violation of protocol alex ayyy desktop 
yes i can both watch it and download it with the url provided by the download helper firefox addon  edit it might be a server side problem i have found a couple of downloadable urls on the site e g http www rtve es alacarta videos grandes documentales grandes documentales maravilloso mundo crustaceos 3144299
yeah it works fine for me it may be geo protected though i compared the f m f4m manifest with a f m f4m manifest from a ripable video and this element was the only major difference  the token protection probably prevents the current script from working on the video 
the physical url that points to the video file www youtube com somevideo mp 4 mp4 for example 
while the exact upload dates of the videos are not given the videos on this page are sorted by upload date as a consequence youtube dl could be optimized by checking the upload date of each video and the other tasks assigned download encode tag only until a single video is out of the date range as all the other videos will not make it it s valid in three cases  youtube dl processes the playlist from the lastest to the oldest video and the dateafter parameter is given as of the last video within the date range all the others are too old  youtube dl processes the playlist from the oldest to the lastest video and the datebefore parameter is given as of the last valid video within the date range all the others are too recent  both parameters are given no matter the way youtube dl processes the playlist as of the last video within the date range all the others are either too recent or too old i hope that i was clear enough an example url https www youtube com user mr suicide sheep mrsuicidesheep videos sorry for the inconvenience i couldn t think of a youtube channel on top of my head so i wrote some youtuber so you could swap it with whoever you want 
sure thing i ll do it tomorrow as soon as i get back to my laptop when you say youtube dl should download courses just fine you mean that it should be collecting all the videos and not just one video when importing cookies right

it doesn t most likely any example ur ls urls mpv doesn t continually get the json from youtube dl it just does a single query so it s not essential to produce fragments list at all with live content things like streamlink livestreamer or youtube dl o  mpv would be required to support livestreams there hasn t been any demand for that on mpv s side since there s still hls streams which do work fine

no but that didnt work before either thats why i used this tool additionally i never used a vpn 
i looked at the to s tos but they only talk about user submissions and what user aren t allowed to submit but nothing that strong enough to fit yt dls requirements i think so if nobody else finds a sufficient notice 
i don t know it was just an example url they have the normal dmca site email address like most other services nowvideo and a lot of other sites included in youtube dl i think the following url doesn t violate copyrights http vidbull com me gn lxm t me4gn6lxm01t html

i don t know for sure if this occurs for all long videos but the bug did occur for the two that i have listed in my original post  which videos work and which dont reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github 
nope i am calling it from my application and reading both standart output and error streams to check whether there was an error processing the request or not you can take a look at my repository https github com oguzhankahyaoglu youtube list syncronizer youtubelistsyncronizer blob master v youtube list syncronizer v2youtubelistsyncronizer youtube list syncronizer youtubelistsyncronizer youtube download exe youtubedownloadexe cs 
previous experience of downloading the entire playlist tells me that the original quality of the audio files i m extracting are always above k 192k i m wanting to limit everything at k 192k so as to preserve space on the phone that i ll be transferring these files to i understand that there ll be some loss in quality but k 192k seems to provide the ideal balance between good quality and conservation of space i may have misunderstood but isn t the whole point of encoding to convert to other than what the original files on you tube youtube are 
ah god i just picked a random video i m in a sfw enviroment right now but i updated the example video with something else let me know if there s something wrong with it 
i ve just checked and the video is still up and it is shown as being public
well i use a vpn to unlock the geo restriction and i indeed can watch the video in the browser 
the video id is the same though when i click the link https mobile twitter com hanan pak hananpak media grid idx tid 0tid https 701050373990174724https mobile twitter com hanan pak hananpak media grid idx tid 0tid 701050373990174724 the only thing opens is a video what i wanted to request is that it can use this id and download the file correctly from twitter 
i see my bad thanks for pointing that out i think it could be an useful feature specially for those of us integrating youtube dl into larger applications i d be happy to take a stab if some direction was given feel free to close or re tag and again thanks for clarifying this 
yes it works fine on a browser

i m using firefox it could be because you aren t logged in perhaps only someone with an hbo go hbogo subscription or hbo now subscription can test and set up each one

yan 12125 yan12125 absolutely i knew that in this case it seems that my question is unclear what i mean here is i couldn t find what parameters should be used to search for youtube videos using youtube dl based on filtering by features k 4k hd creative commons etc then the result of search queries are videos filtered by features only for example i search 10 videos of christmas song  filtered by creative commons license so the result would be 10 videos with cc license only i assume the parameter is like ytsearch christmas ytsearch10christmas song creative commons as i m not a native english speaker so i attached a screenshot hope you ll get it features yt https cloud githubusercontent com assets ae aa ee 1680818421277198ae1aa3ee c e e bf ed eee png c40711e692e5bf25ed11eee4png 
thank you for fixing this so fast 
my strategy according to accept quality i know the range of quality   after i know the range of quality just loop   what s the difference in the resultant video if you set type mp you mp4you just get one quality json data so you just can download one quality video in this condition result video s format is mp 4 mp4

i have problem i have not centos learning i should compile python files for youtube dl i dont undrestand extractor folder should copy in usr bin what work 
on disk the original downloaded audio file is stored with correct unicode glyphs characters on prompt and arguments passed to ffmpeg the unicode characters are converted and shown as characters i imagine the ffmpeg cant localize the file because this translation of characters the output went to clipboard with correct unicode characters but as you see on the print screen its printed with characters image https cloud githubusercontent com assets f fdd c 2525207122159621f83fdd2c df e bda cc png df2811e692718bda50cc6714png 
today i had to download few videos from hotstar and found this in a forum this has been around for over an year but everyone suggested manually modifying the link and using ffmpeg to capture the stream i tried modifying youtube dl and it worked so i thought i would share it here 
thanks for the help removing that from the path seems to solve the problem strangely enough i can then download episodes just fine so what is actually the problem if it solves removing that path from the path environment variable 
tony il capo i couldn t find any way to download the individual files other than going to the weekend page sources and then manually craft a tester page for a single race file as i did above i was hoping there was a way to parse the weekend page and get at least a playlist that may individually be fed to youtube dl for individual download but this issue was closed and i couldn t find any parser around as a semi automated workaround 
the subtitles are in this order english french italian german i want german to be the st 1st subtitle how do i do that 
how send account to you 
this is the extension http en savefrom net sorry for the ad 1 youtube dl has downloading opus but just in some videos doesn t download it with the proper size 2 just to be sure i try to download the opus of the same video with that extension and i download it correctly 3 the video that i have problem with downloading the correct opus file is noted above 4 i tried to download the source as best not opus and youtube dl download ogg but still if this is the best audio why the browser extension can extract opus

it takes forever to do and slows the download for me by extra 11 mins to the mux afterwards where as direct from source ts parts to mp 4 mp4 default is instant with the fixup never command soon as the download is complete that is it on to the next download no wasted time quick and easy need mkv only for the fixing all the timestamp errors in the mp 4 mp4 no tool other than mkvtoolnix so far has been able to fix the mp 4 mp4 i have tried ffmpeg mp 4 mp4 to mkv and that doesn t fix the mp 4 mp4 timestamps errors either or maybe it doesn t use same default settings as mkv toolnix bit 32bit is there reason why youtube dl cannot be coded for direct ts parts to mkv as a default option mp 4 mp4 default with mkv as the option please do test mkv doesn t have the timestamp errors that the mp 4 mp4 now have mkvtoolnix as default does well to fix correctly ffmpeg doesn t 
no do i have to download it and how i use it 
dstftw what do you think about this problem can you explain to us 
ok i see what you mean on the faq that s not the way i asked the same question because the binary file in the tarballs is a big no to me the answer is related since it somehow reveals that this process can be bypassed altogether with main py may i propose a pull request with a clarification of that question on jun 3 2018 1518 sergey m notifications github com wrote did you even read faq you are receiving this because you authored the thread reply to this email directly view it on git hub github or mute the thread 
yes there are as there used to be when this worked very many streams for each url with a predictable pattern of names and one is declared by youtube dl as best in this example 
no i live in us so that i can watch that video without vpn no geolocking error
no same error program gets metadata before to log in dailymotion has a strange behaviour if you use embed url explicit content can be play without error but youtube dl gets info from metadata page which returns an error 
hm i took another random link https d tube v steemsistershow bw svqm bw35svqm that plays well but throws the same error when trying to youtube dl is youtube dl working for you with d tube so that you can send me a link to try 
can youtube dl actually output that instead of error last message repeated 1 times 
yeah i spoke a bit too soon recode does indeed re encode it s nice to have capability in there but unless i can precisely control the encoding configuration then i rather to it separately but it s getting complicated just maintaining an archive already a chore quite a bit more than i thought what i meant to say is that the values are misleading then it should be recode to x 264 x264 or hevc or stuff like that encoding is a bit more involved to fit into one simple command so that could be a bit though out and redesigned but i don t have strong opinions there as i want to preserve the video quality first and foremost even tho i know youtube uses the worst chroma subsampling but it s about archive integrity

yes i ve seen this but there is also somewhere a spec that describes how to use profiles i cannot find it any more currently i found https www w org w3org tr activitypub retrieving objects and in deed they wrote the client must specify an accept header with the application ld json profile https www w org w3org ns activitystreams maybe it s a bug in their test suite i m not sure if the profile spec tells us something about using quotes 
in spring data we support annotations and meta annotations that are annotated with jsr 305 jsr305 annotations to discover whether a package class or method has opted in for non nullability we do not express a limit on meta annotation nesting so one can use either directly jsr 305 jsr305 annotations spring framework annotations that are annotated with jsr 305 jsr305 or further composed annotations that s why we are using annotated element utils annotatedelementutils nonnull s when attribute expresses non nullability or allows opting out to express that a particular argument or return value may be null

rstoyanchev thanks for reply my controller is simple it just takes string field as path variable and uses reactive mongo repository reactivemongorepository to find document from mongo db  get mapping getmapping connect id connectid public mono response entity responseentity user eligibility usereligibility get customer by connect id getcustomerbyconnectid path variable pathvariable connect id connectid string connect id connectid  try return service get user eligibility getusereligibility connect id connectid map response entity responseentity ok default if empty defaultifempty response entity responseentity not found notfound build  catch some exception someexception e  log info error during retrieval of customer  e get message getmessage  return mono just response entity responseentity status http status httpstatus internal server error build  i did go through the 22332 but i need some more clarification i see in 22332 issue reporter ultimately increased the mongo driver wait queue size to pass the tests i tried to do the same by using wait queue multiple waitqueuemultiple 100 but i see that webflux implementation used more cpu and memory than tomcat container i am using docker for windows to containerize and used docker stats to watch the usage i tested both mvc and webflux with concurrent users of k 10k with wait queue multiple waitqueuemultiple 100 i see the below resource usage webflux for a duration of 16 sec cpu utilization was more than 100 and highest being 197 memory spyke was from mb 534mb to 617 mb 83 mb mvc 22 sec cpu utilization was more than 100 and highest being 179 memory spyke was from mb 643mb to 669 mb 26 mb if i increase the concurrent users to k 15k even with wait queue multiple waitqueuemultiple 100 reactive mongo driver will break with com mongodb mongo wait queue full exception mongowaitqueuefullexception  so increasing queue size is not a solution for this issue i see that tomcat runs fine even with k 40k concurrent users just that it uses more threads to fulfil the concurrent requests how to fix this issue is it like my application can only handle k 10k concurrent users that too at the cost of more memory and cpu utilization i might be missing very basic please help me understand how to achieve do more with less tagline of webflux 
lgxbslgx thanks for considering this issue i will give you a step and also some snippet of code i used but you have to provide create a sample api that produces 403 response code 1 create a restful api that produces 403 http code any response body of your choice eg  message 403 forbidden sample  and any request body of your choice eg test sample body 2 request via post request via rest template resttemplate below is my sample function to create a post request via rest template resttemplate
snicoll you re correct that it s blocking but jms sending and receiving both seem to map pretty well to a stream of events much of spring integration is also blocking but has provided support for converting to and from a flux since its domain matches the same event stream model for example given a jms template jmstemplate it d be nice to be able to do something like  both the receive as flux receiveasflux and as subcriber assubcriber methods would obviously have to defer to a blocking threadpool and i m sure there might be a better way to provide that functionality than adding methods to jms template jmstemplate but the core idea is to mimic spring integration by adding convenient functionality for listening to jms messages with a flux message and for pushing messages to a broker from a flux message while it might be blocking we can still have a back pressuring stream that easily integrates with other reactive tools 
yes sure 
i have a subclass of javax servlet http http servlet request wrapper httpservletrequestwrapper  class http servlet request wrapper httpservletrequestwrapper extends servlet request wrapper servletrequestwrapper implements http servlet request httpservletrequest see below  in fact wil caught a exception java lang illegal state exception illegalstateexception current request is not of type com keynes newlife common request yjj http request yjjhttprequest org springframework mock web mock http servlet request mockhttpservletrequest i found that servlet request method argument resolver servletrequestmethodargumentresolver have a high priority to handle it and thus mine http request handler method argument resolver httprequesthandlermethodargumentresolver have no chance to executed so throwed this exception from servlet request method argument resolver servletrequestmethodargumentresolver because servlet request method argument resolver servletrequestmethodargumentresolver and http request handler method argument resolver httprequesthandlermethodargumentresolver supports the same parameter type in other words when default argument resolvers and custom argument resolvers supports same parameter type custom argument resolver always no chance to executed thanks 
as far as i can tell it was to mirror the change in spring projects spring session 1308 the problem there was that they use a once per request filter onceperrequestfilter to wrap the request object and set a request attribute later code when it saw the request attribute assumed the request was wrapped but it wasn t since an error dispatch needs to be done with the original request and response objects in this way an error dispatch differs most significantly from a forward dispatch 
there is already code in the issue description to reproduce the problem

thank you for the quick and thorough answer i realize now i should have given more context i stumbled upon this once migrating from spring boot x 21x to 220 i am bound to a custom enterprise error model where basically each exception thrown is mapped to a json array in the http response i had this test where once zipping multiple exceptions like this  i was then catching them as a composite exception compositeexception in a controller advice controlleradvice like this exceptions unwrap multiple unwrapmultiple exception then serializing to json according to my input i would expect 2 elements in my json array but after migrating to spring boot 220 got 3 instead in fact what i meant by configurable is that i do not want this extra even though stackless exception i tried to get rid of it but on assembly exception onassemblyexception isn t public so i couldn t leverage reflection to filter it out had to rely upon hardcoded java classname instead i also tried spring reactor debug agent enabled false and spring reactor stacktrace mode enabled false without luck i have set up a reproducer for my issue available here https github com beltram spring debug backtrace reproducer if you could pinpoint what i m missing here or provide a cleaner way to get rid of this exception it would be highly appreciated thank you very much 
the use case is running some code that checks some stuff and throws an exception if requirements are not met before each request mapping requestmapping in certain controller s other options for implementing this are not as clean for example interceptors or filters i m calling this inconsistent behavior since in my example check c checkc and check a checka methods are called in the expected order but check b checkb is left out and i m calling it a workaround since the new object in my example is just a dummy object unnecessary garbage to make the methods get called in the expected order two solutions come to mind 1 fully support void type for model attribute modelattribute s 2 do not support void type for model attribute modelattribute s and document this and throw a runtime error during startup check b checkb method was silently being ignored in my project for a long time and perhaps create another annotation for such use cases 
sbrannen here is a stripped down example of the controller 
rstoyanchev upgrading to 2110 did the trick i think there was a bug in 216 version with direct memory leak closing the bug 
yes a custom bean name generator beannamegenerator works perfectly thank you maybe this would be a good enhancement for the spring boot project they could supply a property to choose a custom bean name generator beannamegenerator so i would save me the boilerplate code 10 lines in my main class for completness and to help others this is my current solution 
to help you better understand this problem i wrote a simple demo spring framework version 510

ummm if i restart the instance then that would get rid of all the progress i ve done on it on retail you don t have to restart the instance or anything you just kill each boss and when you have completed this task majordomo executus will spawn after you kill him ragnaros will spawn da hitman dahitman can you confirm this 
just try it and you will see we talk here about phase 3 infernal summon not phase 1 or 2 for some unkown reason in phase 3 fps goes down to 15 or so
it could be 10871 but i m not sure because even if it is alliance human only it should still be turnable in even for the horde because the turn in npc is the same as in the correct quest but at the moment the turn in npc does not have the question mark above his head

when i was googling about this crash it was presented in cores like mangos arcemu and tc 2 tc2 so its not in core it may be in db or something other no core mustnt be in db but its not in core
as i said blackrock grunts blackrock outrunners blackrock shadowcasters i haven t test them all but i believe all blackrock ones have this issue x
unfortunately i do not speak english but try to explain the problem sometimes maybe there are exact cases but they are still unknown for me after teleportation eg after entering instances battlegrounds arenas or leaving them character can not move even turn around but when you modify your movement speed eg gm commands or getting on mount etc character can move again also re login helps so is there is a problem related to the movement of the players when a player moves it constantly bounces but it is not linked to poor internet or lagan server 
example value ranged mod range rangedmodrange for range weapons it must be 100 but that value is 0 your range should be 534 yd range with gun throw bow etc but because the value is 0 so your range is vanish then you can t attack sorry for my bad english

jackpoz rushor wow i didn t know this was bugged in blizzard too o o the supposed behavior maybe is that the server kick you for being afk instead of spam you a message that does nothing every 003 sec with lot of people it might cause performance problems if you are afk but you can logout the server automatically kicks you for being afk a long time but if you can t logout aka you are in a duel it doesn t kick you yeah is blizzlike but maybe we want it fixed just in case 
when i call it in the water it swims behind sometimes but mostly it just stops if i call it from the water remains just stand there on the edge if i then go to the other side it suddenly comes out afterwards is there a fix for it i see this comment https github com trinity core trinitycore trinity core trinitycore issues 9331 issuecomment 16829658 is this the fix sorry for my bad english

ok i will look on it and report if still the issue thank you for answers edit instance template thank you 
sry for that have bad internet connection added revision db
i have sniffed this it is not like there are a lot of waypoints what i also notice is when it happens the npc is not clickable and there is no name when she is flying around 
could this have something to do with unit flag immune to pc as ovahlord said

nope unfortunately not 
no this quest works differently in legion and wotlk
wut those vehicles are common vehicles with accessories something like this  and when you spawn 55918 its orientation will be 0 same with those np cs npcs i mentioned in description 
nothing just unit npc flag gossip in this npc https pastebin com nsj d z 8 nsj0d8z8
what blizzard does is some validation of the parameters checking if the velocity value is correct and the fall time matches in relation to the timestamp difference between when you started the fall and when you landed so to answer your question no if those checks are implemented properly you can t cheat but my point is fall damage should never rely on the actual distance that you have fallen sometimes you end up taking wrong amounts of fall damage in some situations because of this exiting a vehicle or dismounting from fly mount  i can t tell for sure why this happens only sometimes but changing the fall damage mechanic to work like i described here should fix it

i m not sure about that cataclysm and beyond changed too much about the way gossip works i think a lot of them aren t even shown anymore on legion i don t know if it was removed or just hidden maybe someone that knows legion in and out can answer that

they do massive damage jackpoz plus they hit super fast so it takes under a second to wipe the script summons the clones and they are not performing it s functions correctly like killyana said it should be spells 5750057504
i know that this quest was worked on several times already latest in 20853 what i hope for is that this is a general sai logic problem and not related this specific quest and that someone with more in depth knowledge than me i tried to debug it a bit but didnt found the exact problem looks like that you can create a situation where the death of a creature does not increase the script related counter correctly and therefore it can happen to all scripts that use this script mechanic

it s not a failed build after all the exception is thrown before nose is called in ci script sh while testing locales started 2 months ago with https travis ci org pydata pandas jobs 12304585 via 5073 only on the locale override builds cpcloud any ideas what s going on 
here s a comparison of memory use for a series of 8 char strings stored as dtype o ragged strings assuming int 32 int32 used for the level index value since being in memory means we can t handle billions rows anyway i used pympler to measure the memory footprint of python string types  for n rows with n distinct values and s being the mem size of a single value storing it as an index ndarray takes n s storing it as a catagorical labels and levels factors and index values takes n sizeof int 32 int32 n s again we don t treat categorical data as categorical and for string data in particular the memory hit is huge since s sizeof int 32 int32
i don t understand your question about rescaling the data first as for the labels of pd cut that would be a decent solution if duplicates were possible i e if i could do and have anything falling into the first or last bin given the same category but as it stands that isn t possible and so doesn t change things

that fixes this case although there are still a lot of test failures on my 32 bit machine i ll close this since there s issue 1125 open for those 
i agree that there are two changes but they stem from common underlying concerns i was also confused i thought a general shift to allow disabling regex compilation was enabled in pandas core strings but for example str replace still uses this logic  i agree that the behavior of read csv is well documented and the error mesage is appropriate for e g read csv that said the docs are a bit hard to navigate for newcomers but that s a totally separate issue but the reasoning about efficiency and least surprisingness applies just as well here i think in particular a single multi byte unicode character triggers the switch to regexps which is inefficient and confusing to a newbie the auto regexp conversion logic seems parallel and seems like a high level design decision that should be applied across the library and as you can see from the above the high level discussion ends up being more far reaching than i thought there are several functions like str replace that still only have auto regexp in particular i absolutely do not want to change str contains to stick with string matching by default while other core string functions continue to auto convert patterns to regexps consistency is more valuable than one function being more efficient less surprising but let me know if i should split the issue as i said these aren t hard changes and i m happy to do pull request s

oh that would be a bummer we have only 3101 in debian unstable https packages debian org sid python pytest and even older ones x 3x available in other releases of debian add ubuntu that would preclude testing on those platforms i guess i will need to check if there is anything easy way to regain compatibility with older versions of that is the case will update via pip later today to see if that is the reason

i m not sure which issues we were after that have been fixed in master but i do know that if you could provide x 32 x32 bit windows builds we will use them i m using the suggested for x 64 x64 but there seems to be a lot of contradictory info around windows builds i ll try with sdk v 7 v7 as that worked on x 64 x64 but have not seen that referred to for x 32 x32
deliberately
sure i have various monkey patches on the group by groupby i use a downsample monkey patched function that replicates the behavior for resample i m requesting so something like this works  i also may want to send the group by groupby to multiple functions while resampling is fast it makes more sense to do the grouping once and pass it around 
i need to join data frame 1 with data frame 2 and sometimes data frame 1 has 1 row and sometime more than 1 when it has more than 1 the join operation leads to na ns nans and therefore a type conversion of the int columns of data frame 2 when joining them after they have been joined i need to store them in hdf files during an parallel processing for later joining them into a big hdf store but for that the types need to be consistent so i need to avoid the automatic conversion to float for the case data frame 1 has more than 1 row which i prefer to the solution of concert the whole data frame 2 to floats even so it s storing integers conceptually sent from my i phone iphone
i tried to set up a dummy example but it does not fail 
i don t know you think something changed on their side not in pandas 
the use case is the following we are using the boost date time library in our c application timeseries created in our c application can be queried using python and we are looking into using pandas for the timeseries objects returned inside python instead of some bespoke python timeseries classes we are currently using in the boost date time library jan 1400jan 01 000000 is the minimum timestamp and dec 9999dec 31 235959999999 is the maximum timestamp as such our timeseries can have any timestamps in between in principle although our main use case of crazy where crazy means very far away from our current times timestamps is due to constant timeseries which have a single timestamp jan 1400jan 01 in most cases with crazy indices timeseries have a single timestamp on jan 1400jan 01 and then a big gap until more reasonable indices come along out of interest is the limitation in datetime index datetimeindex documented somewhere in particular what are the minimum and maximum timestamp i can use with datetime index datetimeindex 
pandas 073 let me try it with master 
well sort of i tried to reproduce and discovered another strange behavior here is the code for the strange behavior  i realize it s convoluted but i hope it helps the original program is more complex and so far i haven t been able to simply reproduce the behavior i observe but i did find another puzzling behavior 
pandas 0100 python 273 windows 7
i understand well in most cases the reindex operation results in the object that uses the index object passed to it i e the index of the returned object is identical to the passed index object but in this case it is not i thought that pandas would work more efficiently if idexes are identical not just equal trying to optimize cpu cycles here 
afaik the correct way to do this is to state closes 2781 or fixes 2781 in your commit message in which case git hub github will automatically add a reference to this issue in your pr and will automatically close this issue when your pr gets merged into upstream the reason this isn t being done is because you re missing the  symbol in front of the issue number i think it would be a bit premature to close the issue before pr is merged but i m watching the pr am happy to close once it gets merged 
while not larger project i noted this used with https requires io github xmlrunner unittest xml reporting requirements branch master letting us know which dependencies are to be bumped keeping up with latest patches from those projects 
looks like i was inaccurate about the error message thrown the above throws an index error indexerror version 0100
you are correct sorry i missed that one more question though what threw me was the fact that it works with the option delimiter but fails with delimiter i still don t understand that since i thought the two should be the same but anyway you can go ahead and close the issue thanks for the quick feedback 
awesome thanks for the quick response and i lust learned something new pd options display width 200 solves my real issue with the wide data frame column wrapping for anyone using wide screen monitors smile thanks for the great customization 
i was just trying to avoid computing any percentiles median because that often involves sorting which could take some time depending on how many columns of data you are looking at i suppose the median 50median makes sense to have in describe as a default still i would think that passing an empty list would not compute even the median 50median 
no i don t think it does maybe i am misunderstanding something the tests i see in this commit don t expose the ordering issue the default ordering of dicts seem to be more or less alphabetical or numerical depending on the indices in the code above i am reversing the indices from their natural order and i would expect the dataframe to have the same row ordering as the keys list however the dataframe has the normal ordering of the strings i m using the columns orientation for the input data anyway maybe i shouldn t expect the indices to be in their original order then this is an interactive session to show the issue 
thanks jreback i just refreshed from master still having the same problem 
oh thanks tom augspurger tomaugspurger i m on python 35 in os x 64 el capitan 
pandas version 10 platform linux get info is a huge huge dataframe that is indexed by a timeseries i think we should be fine without fyi if i use match price get info get info index 0 i get the same problem and error
i ran a few tests w timeit like as a slow test or w vbench 1 1 https github com wesm pandas blob master vb suite frame methods py
when i used pip install pandas it tried to install numpy as well since it s a dependency however that build seemed to fail when i subsequently issued pip install numpy numpy did install correctly i unfortunately lost the pip log though i can probably reproduce it if needed this fixed the problem thanks a bunch 
so let s discuss this over at 3479
it s similar df groupby apply applies the function to the underlying data frame dataframe in each group so the function should take a data frame dataframe this pipe implementation would act on the groupby itself so you pass it functions whose argument is a data frame group by dataframegroupby so with this you could do

to build pandas i used the command pip install pandas to install the virtualenv it was so long ago i cannot remember i just followed the simple instructions they provide to create the virtualenv i run the command source users rmschne virtualenv rmspython bin activate is there a right way for pandas to work i did not notice anything special in docs update i looked in my records and i used http docs python guide org en latest starting install osx html for how to install virtualenv pip etc 
how would you use replace for the parenthesis bear in mind that the value then needs to be negated 
under the hood that is essentially what would be happening imho the proposed alter method would just be less typing and more readable 
ts ts 111 ts111ts111 that is substract 1 from the timestamp ts 1 ts1 to obtain 30091999 and then subtract 1 again to obtain 30061999 however the frequency information is lost along the way and this generates an error 
my previous comment about my bug was confusing the bug occurred when there was a non empty index intersection and i therefore expected to step into an if block since bool returned false my code did not step in 
if i weren t overcommitted at work i would sorry  i m creating a workaround for my specific case not sure how to generalize 
i stumbled upon it because i do a merge and then create a new column which is a copy of the index for further manipulation sometimes that merge leaves me with an empty data frame dataframe more generally i might want to create an auto numbered column with df foo  range len df with the recent code change i either have to change that to df foo  pd series range len df or do a check to ensure that df is not empty 
this is from 0140 but i have experienced the same on master yesterday update tested again on current master still the same 
this will trigger the segfault as well numpy 171 172 pandas 0130 note that the print df is required to generate the segfault 
i d like to help but i m just getting started with cython if i get better i will chip in 
my search turned up issues 3041 3043 3552 and 3555 whoa github s auto complete on those issue numbers seems totally unrelated 
pandas 0120 numpy 171 and python 332 i will confirm the issue with pandas 0131 and numpy 181 in few hours the x series xseries is simply defined as in the example above 
after some playing around one hypothesis is that the bug has something to do with int 32 int32 vs int 64 int64 dtypes so initially i exported it to csv and tried it on another computer and i got the right answer i then saved it as an hdf 5 hdf5 file and i got the wrong answer looking at the dtypes 
sinhrks yes of course apologies how about this  jreback apologies i should have used loc should i treat ix as deprecated and avoid use i guess we could have three different indexers depending on how you want missing values to be handled xx union bar ba  xx intersect bar ba  reindex bar ba or a parameter that specifies how to handle it eg xx missing error intersect union bar ba perhaps reindex could accept an error intersect union aren t reindex and loc fundamentally the same thing or am i missing a key distinction one distinction would be that loc accepts boolean series but instead the indexing values case 
tom augspurger tomaugspurger yes that s the trick 
when the table is in the test schema  when creating a table in sql server if a schema is not specifically designated the table will be created in the user s default schema perhaps this issue could be fixed if pandas specified a schema for sqlalchemy to use that the user could potentially override 
i posted an answer on what works for me in the first question installing from source but for some reason i cannot get to install it using pip 
ideally i would have either wanted the cast to work as python unicode function that is returned object are always of the unicode type  unicode objects are left unchanged  numbers are stringified into unicode strings  str object are decoded using the default encoding and a unicode object is returned does that make sense in pandas

ack i think i might be misleading you by convoluting 0141 with the dev version however the problem does stand for rolling apply when the aggregating function will likely be naive about the presence of trailing na n nan values my apologies i first noticed this with rolling apply and then i started working with the latest stable and thought i had discovered that the problem was more general i ll re state the issue this evening when i am able to get in front of my dev box again 
actually i asked why x cased doesn t behave like what you call the mutated case not the other way round also i m returning a series when i get in a dataframe in the apply function how is x 2 mutation while x foo is not if it s impossible to disambiguate when the return types are different well i don t know what you mean the docstring for group keys is  what i m trying to do is to get the group keys included in the index when i call apply i already have a workaround it just seemed like a bug if you re sure this is all just fine feel free to close 
mhh because i need to compare all the dates one by one sent from my i phone iphone
don t have a strong preference on how it behaves or if we keep as index just want to get rid of inconsistent behavior 
sorry the silly question but where i do issue this command pd show versions 
kawochen have a look at is list like  it does almost exactly that https github com pydata pandas blob master pandas core common py l 2329 l2329 the headline of my suggestion is that we consolidate encapsulate the list checking there rather than do it differently in different places definitely agree putting iterables list like objects in an index is not a good idea 
yes i ll do that but it might take some time 
sure in sql server management studio if you double click on the table and expand constraints you ll notice the duplication of constraints if you right click on the table and do script table as create to new query editor you ll get the following code which also shows the duplication of constraints 
i don t have a pandas 0191 installation if you can get someone else to test this out feel free to close it
kawochen using as delimiter solved the problem i got the following output  jorisvandenbossche i understood the mistake in trying to use as the delimiter since one of the fields was already having in the data field hence creating the difficulty with csv quote none thanks guys 
they re id values bucketed by year but with enough head room to allow millions of users in the future so they re not datetimes and they re stored in a server as floats 
in the above i would think of t as present and 0 or n in my suggestion as the start here is an example what i was wondering was if it is possible to add a window such that there is n exponentially decaying weights and the rest are 0 so for the above data with n 3 for example for the last element of the series we would have eq https eq3https cloud githubusercontent com assets bfc e c 2401026104198965bfc3e8c e e b f fbe 705311e581e4572b544f5fbe png 
can do tom augspurger tomaugspurger just to confirm when you say link to those docs is the general practice to put that in a see also section or actually add a hyperlink i e 
tom augspurger tomaugspurger i m trying to finalize some things i want to get isoparse in there and possibly a few improvements to the time zones i am hoping a new feature release before the end of the year i usually finalize a release on master and let it sit for a week or so i can ping you when that happens so you ll have some notice

hi in both cases i have latest numpy 1101 i don t know if it s related or not but i actually got to this issue because i have a series where values are frozensets in that case not only fails but there is also an exception maybe the traceback helps you to know if this is numpy or just pandas related
jreback so i have something that works fine with python 3 but python 2 presents a problem because in python 2 round class doesn t call class round  in other words you can t easily override the built in round behavior in python 2 i m not sure of the best way to handle this i could just avoid the round test in the testing code when doing a python 2 test and we don t worry about supporting round data frame dataframe with python 2 other suggestions welcome 
tom augspurger tomaugspurger i did that i get the setting with copy warning settingwithcopywarning error jreback here s a copy pastable example  the error seems to be when including inplace true the opration works fine when doing df 1 df1 df drop df1drop orig axis 1
jorisvandenbossche in my computer this code example will cause an error import pandas as pd import numpy as np from rpy robjects rpy2robjects import pandas ri pandas2ri from rpy robjects rpy2robjects import r a r iris b pandas ri pandas2ri ri py ri2py a pandas ri pandas2ri py ri py2ri b 
tom augspurger tomaugspurger thanks for the interest snippet can now be run as is and will trigger the same error 
i set locale setlocale locale lc numeric  and want floats to use local decimal point symbol this can be achieved with n format value but pandas uses formatting for strings inside to native types function which doesn t support n format as of python 34 x 64 x64 win 7 this works df to csv buf sep t header header index false float format g these don t df to csv buf sep t header header index false float format n python formatting doesn t know n format df to csv buf sep t header header index false float format n pandas uses formatting p s maybe this refers to python issues and this issue should be closed 
thank your for the hint to use rot is there a similar parameter which prevents pandas from only showing every second label on the x axis 
my versions pandas version  0162 numpy version  192 python 2710 the code is just chunk to hdf all data h 5 h5 df mode a format table append true chunk is dataframe it appends a couple of times until crashing
yes it does indeed look like a duplicate and yes if this is the intended behaviour what a weird choice though then the docs need to be fixed which i might pr but nobody should hold their breath over that thanks for quick response 
yeah just trying to adhere to the contributing guidelines sorry if it s unclear basically i d like verify schema code https github com pydata pandas blob master pandas io gbq py l 476 l476 to change currently it takes the schema of a big query bigquery table which will usually have name type mode and possibly a description the generate bq schema code https github com pydata pandas blob master pandas io gbq py l 735 l735 takes a pandas dataframe and creates a big query bigquery like schema that only has name and type not mode or description i think that verify schema should only compare the big query bigquery table s schema fields name and type to the dataframe s schema i just submitted my pull request here https github com pydata pandas pull 13087 although i haven t completed all the checkboxes that might explain it better 
it s different to downcast which concerns narrowing maybe inplace strings or direct strings support for downcast in to records would be handy too but that s a separate issue 
can confirm it works in 0242 thanks tom augspurger tomaugspurger closing
confirmed that the above example now works on 0202 conda distribution however i now get a different error if i try to update an existing record even with identical contents  i suspect this is an entirely different kind of error so it might make sense to close this one out and start a new issue but i ll leave that call to you

i just updated to pandas 0181 sry for not trying with updated panda version now both of my plot calls hide the data on the first axis sorry for my bad wording by strange i meant just that is looks different
well this is just a reduced minimal example i am analysing some web log files with each line having a user id userid as one of the columns for each user i want to extract set of sessions i e from event login to event logout so i group by userid and then apply to each group the method that finds starts and end times and returns a dataframe of them the method works fine unless there is a user without any complete session i e the apply method returns a column with none s only actually this example is even more compact  it seems to me quite a natural way group by apply to each group get a dataframe back for each group that gets combined into one big list of sessions 
i will work on getting a compact standalone example but you can see an example of the errors and inputs here http stackoverflow com questions new 41729212new error during set labels in pandas valueerror 0192valueerror unequal label lengths 41729634 41729634
the types are very closely related and they have the same output count unique top and freq perhaps the bigger issue is with the wording of the docstrings it literally uses the word categorical maybe there could be an addition of a new word for category like data which would include object category bool and datetime 
thanks for the quick fix guys
 the syntax is much cleaner if you want a mix of columns and row multi index multiindex levels with the added bonus it is 20 faster than selecting columns before calling itertuples
gfyoung i ve been seeing this warning for a long time the earliest version i ve used is 020 i think 
yes i have scipy version 0181 installed on both environments python 36 and python 27
tested with master it is still failing with the same error message pandas dev 0210dev gd f d 7 8gd50f981d7
i m building it now but python setup py develop is super slow runs only one process 
here you go 
in 4988 jreback requested needs to be in a separate pr from the deprecation change my original pr for 4988 was to change the keyword from parse cols to usecols to match other read functions and implement this functionality this issue was created to separate the kwarg change from the functionality change 
personally i found myself rewriting this function over and over again putting it in the cookbook won t solve this problem i can understand why this is not a good fit to the core of pandas but i m wondering whether one can find a better fit for example a pandas utils library 
fixed it thanks rik
no this code is a part of a big project but i can try to reproduce 
confirm that the above snippet does not raise with 0202 fyi i think that 0192 comes down with anaconda 431
for example i want to have background gradient colors for 2 columns ctrl and test in a data frame dataframe but the background gradient colors are decided according to the difference of the 2 columns i achieved it as below  image https user images githubusercontent com c ba d 824507456032887015c580ba5d e af c ed png 11e8816038af1c8ed142png

yes the ddof parameter in data frame dataframe std is similar setting it to 0 would indeed be equivalent to bias true actually i just realized that numpy cov also has a ddof parameter and it definitely seems to be a more flexible parameter i ve changed the issue name to reflect this 
gfyoung i added the plots the day i created this issue any follow up since then 
gfyoung here is the output as the code stands you ll notice that the output of the variable transformed all at once near the bottom of the printout is missing the groupby key which is typeid however when the iteration by groups is looping the returned dataframe from transform includes typeid the output i expect from the transformed all at once section should also include the typeid column which was the groupby key is this not the correct expectation thanks 
hi i can confirm that 0202 fixes our problem because it does not see next method in 0201 but in general it is not the first time we got surprising breaks due to some changes like this do you know why we start changing this logic since 020 isn t duck typing rule sufficient here 
first step is to report the bug logistically it seemed smarter to prompt discussion about the issue rather than just attempt a unilateral fix 1 should the behavior change or should the attribute error attributeerror be documented 1 if the behavior should change does the community prefer none or as a return value for stata files that don t support value labels  my vote is i ll happily submit a pr for either of the proposed behavior changes but as a pandas pr is more than simply a diff to a single py file i wanted to determine which fix if any before putting the pr together

sorry for troubling you when using sqllite 3 sqllite3 it s no problem and then cause overflow error overflowerror long too big to convert
no i just wanted to raise the attention in case this is not on purpose 
sure i will give writing a pr a try 
this is a sample scenario which comes common in scd slowly changing dimension there are work around for it but it would be better if there was some temporary variable scenario 1 select a list of columns from source data frame natural keys col 1 col1 col 2 col2 2 apply md 5 md5 function after merging all columns as string and add to temp column the source dataframe source df cdc 3 select same set of columns from target data frame 4 apply md 5 md5 function after merging all columns as string and add to temp column the target dataframe target df cdc 5 compare the cdc column between source and target data frame and set a temp column to specify flag like values matching nc no change value not matching u update value matching na ignore target cdc is null i insert in above scenario step 2 4 and 5 needs to have a temp variable and no point in saving its value in hard disk i hope it clears everything 
sure 
of course you can recreate with this zipcode example xlsx https github com pandas dev pandas files zipcode 2825182zipcode example xlsx 
yes you re right thanks no need for me to use drop at all 
sorry for so late replying you can have a try with operating cassandra database any select my code have no any special setting thank you 
sorry i didn t provide more context i think it is inconsistent because of the following example creating an instance of the lib tslib na t type nattype class directly does not register as null for pd isnull 
the user given dictionary updates current key value file metadata if user gives pandas key then it overwrites pandas metadata but warning warn is issued purpose user metadata is very needed when 1 processing is done in several stages and you want to keep information about version algorithm used on each stage so you can debug it later 2 processing is done with different parameters and you want to keep parameters used with the file 3 you need to add extra custom information e g sometimes one column comes from one source and sometimes it is calculated from other columns and you want to keep this information and pass to later stages of processing 4 you have certain very high level aggregates that are costly to compute and you do not want to create columns for them for me it is a very important feature and one of the main reasons i want to switch to parquet

i get an error on python 365 freshly installed with anaconda on a linux it works well on python 2714 which was also installed with anaconda on the same system 
i have been poking around through trial and error the best that i can come up with is that 1 it is for dates only times seem to be unaffected 2 it seems to work when the frequencies are things like w mon which means it just works on anchored offsets i came across snap when i was looking for a round floor type method that can handle time changes i still don t know if snap would work but i know that it doesn t seem to do what i expect based on the little documentation i can find 
i posted the one on so then after jezrael commented there i posted on git thanks for taking this forward on mon jul 9 2018 at 1248 am tom augspurger notifications github com wrote  kind regards martien martien lubberink ph d phd m blucap gmail com h 64 4 232 9495 m 64 21 134 7500 m 316 8155 8570 m 44 774 558 4224 no need to hit the send key just talk to me 
gfyoung thank you for your answer by implicit i mean  i consider that a na n nan value in an array is a value  that value counts is asking for counting the number occurrences of each value  thus since na ns nans are value they should be included in the value counts output the function is implicitly without clearly stating it dropping na ns nans  moreover it is opposed to my expectation in terms of behaviour what s your use case of value counts  doesn t the benefit of having information about na n nan values which is very informative about the structure of your data and leads to potential error findings in a data munging use case outweighs the cost of having an additional na n nan line in the output 
i ve got a data frame dataframe and a collection of functions expecting series of various lengths each returning a series of potentially different length i want to chunk the data frame dataframe into various columns apply the appropriate functions and then rejoin the data frame dataframe for the most part this works fine but it gets confused if the function expects a series of length 0 that said even without the above reason it seems odd to me to treat the trivial case differently to all other cases it s just bound to cause weird behaviour in edge cases

thats fair i get your point but im expecting at least the 0 1 3 indexed 4indexed integers being converted to date times and 99998 can be left as is is that something i should be anticipating

certainly there are plenty of ways to avoid it but many users often prefer to use single line implementations of pandas rather than wrapping in more python functionality and i d probably default overwrite to ignore to keep behavior typical again the use case here is a typical pandas using data science project in a notebook where a cell may be errantly executed without thinking the value add is certainly not enormous and of course someone wishing to be careful could write the check themselves still would be convenient

from a pure csv perspective i would expect the field to be completely empty since it is a missing value the two signs are making the parsing harder  is also an na representation 
ok i tried one more time all dependencies are satisfied 
i guess the source data frame dataframe is expected since an empty sequence is just empty and there is nothing to append like this
yes still happens even if i put the column name as a hard coded string in both sides 
thank you what do you mean by the code i have provided is all copy paste so it is 100 accurate i e with that code in my system i can produce this issue i tried just now in python and ipython on the same env error comes in notebook and i can t reproduce either so i think this is somehow related with jupyter notebook i will report the issue there 
i think this would be perfectly fine after all the complex numbers is still a float in this case and when you have the dot zero format you immediately know that it is a float and not an integer complex number its the same reason why you have the dot zero format for plain float numbers 
that does help i think it might be worth calling out explicitly the potential side effects like locks so users are clear on the potential impacts 
sorry my mistake it should be a series 
i have almost halved the lines of code i hope it is not too much now since i am not sure what more to delete and still express the problem sufficiently would you consider the asserts too much i put them there because i think they showcase pretty clearly what the issue i have found is 
cannot comply the machine i have for this has no access to the internet i did used the latest release on a clean venv python 364 anaconda inc and the error is there 
json value 34 converting as mar 4mar in csv instead of 34
i am not very well versed in profiling methods but i am more than happy to figure it out do you have any recommended methods if it makes a difference i am using google colab also i would be happy to provide the notebook i am using it is self contained and downloads the data directly from my google drive so all you have to do is press run and then go to the final cell to check the sql code 
you mean profile this script only or profile its calling from within pandas source code have never heard used snakeviz before will check it to thanks 
i thought i included a minimal example i included one section of the dictionary and the code that created the dictionary entries i m pretty sure i did fill out the issue template is it better now

i find the problem my code is like 
i ve uploaded the information requested 
i think i added the lines that can reproduce this behavior not sure if it is missing here it is  sample residual pcts residuals pct e 00445160010031137117106758e 640003522454006517148600603375100132551400056207990006225719004571382500392807860000531307 creating a dataframe with residual percent d pd data frame dataframe residuals columns residual pct  shifting the pct 1 row down d residual pct shift  d residual pct shift 1 calculating the adjusted residual pct d adj residual pct  d residual pct shift rolling 3rolling window mean 3mean 
tom augspurger tomaugspurger i don t actually know how to find that pr thanks for the suggestion dsaxton i have indeed worked around this issue so my question is maybe more philosophical  if i take a sample of bananas is it okay to return no bananas this feels wrong to me but i can not articulate what the problem is exactly 
in case its of interest i used chardet as suggested in the below which uses it if encoding is not specified reading the first k b kb to determine encoding this obviates the unfortunate situation wherein reading a utf 16 as utf 8 does not generally throw an error but will munge up the data 
ill check for that thanks 
if you can reproduce the problem at 0253 but not at master i think we can call this closed as already fixed if not i m going to need your help on how to build the master version as i ve not done it before 
thank you for the quick follow up tom augspurger tomaugspurger running your suggested code conda create n pandas rc 0 100rc0 c conda forge label rc c conda forge pandas rc 0 100rc0 pandas rc 0 100rc0 installs okay then trying to install jupyterlab to run pandas in a jupyter notebook fails with 
0253 thank you for yr advise and i will try other version later 
confirmed fixed in rc 0 100rc0 thanks for the quick response 
zzapzzap i m using pandas 101 as shown in the output of pd show versions the problem is definitely with df 2 df2 and int 64 int64 because that s the one throwing the error 
i dont think it is a bug but it is a new request 
updated with reproducable example
hi tom augspurger tomaugspurger thank you for the advice the tests really helped me for understanding the code design closing this issue cheers 
actually it is a numpy problem because i cannot import numpy anyway i have solved the issut by using pandas from conda forge channel i don t know what is the difference but now it works

yeah setting it to a new dataframe or using inplace true works idk why that didn t occur to me i have to keep header none because sometimes i get the same file with a weird header like because they wanted to make it pretty and othertimes not thanks very much 
ok https github com sensio sensio generator bundle sensiogeneratorbundle issues 86
yeah i wasn t sure if it needed to be reviewed as a patch first i ll make a pull request for it instead

thanks after fixing my code and use the set last modified setlastmodified function of response it works fine i forgot to add gmt as dmaicher said thanks for the hint tobion 
i m using php 7083
tested 21562 there is now a behavioural difference with respect to the previous released version using my own example a null account id accountid and a non null tenant uuid tenantuuid used to always pass validation even if in the db there was already a record with null account id accountid and the same tenant uuid tenantuuid the same scenario now fails validation i m not sure which is the most correct behaviour but merging this will cause a small bc break 
schmittjoh fails with same error with both pre providers in memory users 70 password pass roles role user  pre and pre providers in memory users 70 password pass roles role user  pre if you look at prototyped array node prototypedarraynode it checks pre if isset v this key attribute keyattribute  is int k  pre so its always true for numbers and throws exception i don t see a good reason for checking is int thanks 
i haven t know about this option can you please suggest how my code should be changed to use it 
fabpot i ll give a try tomorrow maybe thx
good catch i can t test now but i think that s it i ll confirmed tomorow 
exactly throwing access denied http exception accessdeniedhttpexception is correct but this should lead to a 403 response 
ok i didn t find the similar issue 6866 blame it on me i used the search both google and github  browsed opened issues and failed to find it i apologize for being part of the human species this being said as bendavies said the comment posted by tobion was not very helpful now back to this issue which really actually was 6864 it was supposed to be fixed fifteen days ago and merged into 22 so it could be a regression or perhaps the thing never got fixed properly in the first place i ll link to this issue in that discussion 
not really on specific pages for example it also appears on the profiler ajax request fatal in firebug we deal with a lot of sub requests 1020 and odm orm queries 1010 queries per page max i don t think it s a doctrine 2 doctrine2 related problem as i got the same error in a propel symfony 2 symfony2 project which does not have any sub request btw the next hit after the fatal error is ok maybe an environment related problem i m using a vm with cent os centos php libs up to date xdebug

it s still buggy with it but breaks a lot of my other stuff as well will try to extract some example code could take a while though 
php 568 in my composer json i added and ran composer update symfony phpunit bridge to install it then the errors occured when running phpunit c app removing the bridge afterwards makes the tests pass again 
nicolas grekas after a discussion on slack i ve tried what you recommended without success 
stof and fabpot understood the problem let me try again to clarify but tbh my brain is wrappled into a lot of problem solving in another domain so not sure i can remember exactly check this one https github com braincrafted bootstrap bundle pull files 362files i think if you install the bundle and use 27 you will see the exception and errors 
i m building a bundle 1 that allows a user to authenticate against atlassian crowd and use it s single sign on ability if the user is logged into crowd at the point the firewall is triggered and i have to create my token to pass to the authentication provider authenticationprovider i don t have any info about the user not even a username so i have to create a token with no roles 2 if i continue to extend abstract token abstracttoken i seem to be stuck and will not have any ability to add roles to my token once i discover who this user is alternatively i could simply implement the token interface tokeninterface myself but abstract token abstracttoken provides 99 of what i need after looking at the code a bit more after i created the ticket i believe overriding get roles getroles is not the correct solution instead i d like to add a protected set roles setroles and then i would override set user setuser to call the parent pull the roles from the user object passed in and then pass them to this set roles setroles 1 https bitbucket org asa ayers asaayers crowdbundle 2 https bitbucket org asa ayers asaayers crowdbundle src f c a 876f60c9336a security firewall sso listener ssolistener php cl 40
i had to refactor some code for a different issue which solved this issue as well maybe i overlooked something since i cannot reproduce this anymore i ll close this issue 
i have several usecases i need a parser where all numbers and strings are parsed trough some function of my own i also would like to tweak the parser to allow strings without quotation marks as in some of my use cases i do not need variables i might want to add my own operators the first 2 use cases can be achieved easily if one could overwrite the parse primary expression parseprimaryexpression in the parser i understand my use cases might be rare however being unable to change anything in the current classes makes nothing of those use cases possible 
jupp give me some time until tomorrow evening got to work on those other two tickets i wanted to create pull requests for too 
i use this forms via javascript ajax submit to api controller wich expects to see single form
i think this behavior is not intuitive maybe some warning must be given 
michelsalib the use case is simple i update some translation file for example slovak after some time a new validation feature come to symfony this feature request new translation messages but the author of this change update only some language files i m not watching those files because i m interseted in languages that i can translate other xliff files miss new messages as time goes a lot of messages are not translated and are missing it would be easier to see the changes it those new messages will be added to every translation files in default english format stof fallback feature is not working as a whole if i have location set to slovak and the slovak translation file is present will be some messages displayed in french and others in slovak because slovak translation file miss some few translations it will be displayed in english because this language is a base language for each translation so the idea is to add these english messages into all current translation files it will work same or i m wrong i saw the proces of adding defualt messages to translation files in sonata admin bundle sonataadminbundle https github com sonata project sonata admin bundle sonataadminbundle another option will be to create tool to show missing translations for example kc finder kcfinder has some http kcfinder sunhater com lang editor langeditor el or some notification system to all translators 
tobion yes i undestand your point of view i m pretty sure that this is the first time that the options resolver optionsresolver blew up on my code i don t think that there are lot of normalizers on sub options yet i d guess that this could cause heah dude heahdude yes i already implemented a workaroud as we ve got some further code to handle select 2 select2 in build view buildview of our base choice type extension choicetypeextension i moved the attr resolving into that block i don t know if where the options resolving for form types is documented adding a hint on this issue could prevent users from stumbling upon this 
here is my code simplified  i had no exception thrown i m using testing smtp configuration i assume some smtp server may return an error in that case btw this command would be nice in the mailer component i think do you want a pr of it 
i agree without a ldap in hands to work with what i say may be a little bit too much abstract so here is an example sorry for long post https files nekland fr potato sorry long post webp let s consider this fixtures  but my user entity also contains first name firstname and last name lastname fields which are not retrieved by the default ldap user provider ldapuserprovider besides it s kinda standard to use gn and cn for that purpose here are solutions i see with the current implementation of the ldap user provider ldapuserprovider  copy pasting the whole code and adding mine also returning another kind of user and maybe removing the custom ldap provider that i write before  adding a new decorator that calls ldap again with same query stupid but working but what looks best here would be to be able to extend the ldap user provider ldapuserprovider to me especially because there s a load user loaduser https github com symfony symfony blob bfa adab c f b d ca b e a 9bfa25869adab00162c246f4b76d65ca3b78e41a src symfony component ldap security ldap user provider ldapuserprovider php l 149 l149 method protected which is great but all attributes are private  understandable adding final keyword should be considered then it would indicate the way of working with this provider and the protected method should be removed as well 
stof the commit was where i was in the codebase also my ad for not readin the upgrade instructions mvrhov thanks what was the reasoning why it was removed 
in fact this case appear when you click on the button to switch to other user right and you back immediatly on the previous page by clicking with your mouse or the back button of the browser and change for an other user because you wrong 
just to be coherent with bundle resources folders nothing more 
honestly i m not sure i will have the needed time and skill i don t know findstr at all for instance to work on this i opened the issue mainly as a feature request and for discussion i d be glad to help when if i can though 
for example with such an entity  a restaurant can decide to automatically assign a level to its customers based on their number of reservation if so it can set different levels bronze silver and gold so if is cutomer level auto iscutomerlevelauto is true i have to check that level bronze levelbronze level silver levelsilver level gold levelgold i put a constraint on the restaurant to check this and add violations but because this constraint is added before property constraints propertyconstraints i don t know if i have valid integer for each level that s why i would like to choose the priority between the different constraints but maybe i do it wrong is there another way to check this case 
no i tried adtype image file row as well as adtype imagefile row but no luck

hi tobias if by an upgrade you mean php composer phar update i did it 1 hour before modifying autoload php and making this error so i was at last commit of x 28x dev i deleted the dev folder but blank page stayed then launched the command line i mention in my post and it displayed the error in my cmd window when i solved the error no more blank page cheers 
hi jfsimon https github com symfony symfony standard pull 215 hacfi yes i am using apc but not php fpm but somebody suggest me that could be a problem with apc so i will make some test today and let you know thanks
i am not sure pdo is the problem in this case simply adding the statement did the trick in my case at least the schema create command could do it s work after that 
example  if the myprop field is set to e g 123 the above constraint does not catch as it is supposed to 
bschussek i think not really the way the guessers work is that there is the form type guesser chain formtypeguesserchain with several guessers registered the guess with the best confidence wins so we have only the option from the guess winner i am not wan t hook into the form type guess wokflow i wan t modify set some options for the type and in my view the required min and max options should not depends on the guess process there are not relevant for that they should be moved into a post event or into a post process 
i highly doubt that class name can include space or new line the method that throws an exception explicitly checks for class names and not some arbitrary parameter 
hello vicb it s my fault i ve defined the fallback and default locale as the same 
i didn t an in depth analysis but for what i saw i think not 
x 22x imho error suppression is suitable here
i know this is not something very important and there are very few cases where this is necessary but i think it would be great to provide a standarized mechanism to give the bundle another name instead of picking without giving any choice the class name in the end it s a matter of choice and i think that when i develop for a framework i should be given any possible ways of customizing it whether it makes sense or not

phansys yes i checked through lang parameter in the layout and running the command you leave get this error stof does not work means that it works for a few translated strings but for the rest it doesn t for example this translation registro natural panel titulo paneltitulo trans works but this one campos tipo tramite tipotramite trans doesn t both are in the same messages es yml file i have no translation domains created or something else furthermore i m using js translation bundle jstranslationbundle https github com willdurand bazinga js translation bundle bazingajstranslationbundle blob master resources doc index md and the same issue happens some strings are translated some not

stof there are getters for quite a few of those properties having a rather long statement like the one you suggested in order to have defaults which are specified when creating the request instance by the way is another argument for a short getter in my eyes at least for such a rather common use case

stof good job  ini set xdebug max nesting level 100 bad ini set xdebug max nesting level 101 good
the problem is non obvious behavior to me it seemed that by default all should be escaped no matter tag or filter it turns out that the trans and trans doing a few different things why do i need to translate the executable code for example the trans h foo h3foo h 3 h3 endtrans as stated in the documentation in real life most likely would have been h 3 h3 trans foo endtrans h 3 h3
for field image required is set to true but if i don t fill this field in form then is valid isvalid return false and form render error message 
ok i see https github com symfony symfony commit c b a df ad d f f f fe ad d 8c6b7a49126df8ad7d54f88f9f397fe403ad891d i use 212 version and i don t have this bugfix thanks for your answer 
yeah i think it is master
problem is fixed with https gist github com 3607658
i m working on the fixes for different branches the 22 branch is over did the pull request now is time for the 23 since intl date formatter test intldateformattertest was written differently there 
i m not sure exactly what xabbuh is referring to so hopefully he can provide a testcase demonstrating his concerns all i could provide is a test case showing that the setter is called over the removed adder 
i ment the concept not really then lets say em persist this get security context get token gettoken get user getuser em flush same story have done this since the start of symfony 2 and suddently it does not work anymore but i will make a fork and replicate the bug 
not yet for whatever reason a very simple example doesn t do this which is what i would expect i just can t see why its happening for me if this happened all the time everyone would be filing a bug 
iltar i was thinking about other places where this feature would be useful so i checked other symfony bundle configuration files and atually i couldn t come up with any other examples from other bundles that s simply because security bundle securitybundle configuration has very deep structure http symfony com doc current reference configuration security html it is mostly easy to decorate in other places because it is usually obvious which services it s i ds ids belong to the default functionality so other examples from my applications are again from security bundle securitybundle btw this is just a simple login form when user logs in he is redirected to a page he came from i don t use http referer header because for example when you refresh the login page the previous page is lost i don t use sessions for storing the referer because that could cause problems with caching like when using varnish so i just simply pass the referring url in a query parameter and then using target path hidden field cool but suddenly a bug arrives when the user tries to log in using bad credentials then the referring url query parameter is lost so i decided to specify custom failure handler i wanted it to decorate the default one because i try to prefer composition over inheritance but symfony suggest to extend default authentication failure handler defaultauthenticationfailurehandler there is a docblock saying can be optionally be extended from by the developer to alter the behaviour while keeping the default behaviour notice the triple be  that s actually not a problem just an example where decoration could be preferred  another related example since the referring url is passed in the query parameter i decided to prevent the application from redirecting to other sites than those from my application ur ls urls matched by router is a solution good enough again i decided to extend default authentication success handler defaultauthenticationsuccesshandler but composition would taste better  another example is the one mentioned in the linked issue decorating the entry point if the decoration of this default behaviour would be as simple as it is when implementing other decorators the decorates feature of service definition then these issues would be simpler to solve and classes like custom authentication success handler customauthenticationsuccesshandler and custom authentication failure handler customauthenticationfailurehandler could be deprecated favor this approach 
i have tried 214 and master
hi i m using the 214 release from symfony website downloaded couple of days ago i will pull the latest commits later today and check for this issue and update this ticket thanks 
javiereguiluz that is great thank you for referring to that feel free to close this issue 
sorry i haven t responded fabpot i had this issue on a finished project and haven t had time to revisit it i was using 217 if it comes up for me again i will try to track it down and try to give more insite into the potential issue 
to my great shame it was my fault the date was modified because i was calling date add inside a repository those methods modify the passed object by reference and return it it is to note that variables seem to be passed by reference to repositories while debugging i encountered another issue an array was returned and not some datetime however i was not able to replicate it later 
hi i think choice loader has priority https github com symfony symfony blob c cf e b a ea d fec e b dcd src 5129c4cf7e294b1a5ea30d6fec6e89b75396dcd2src symfony component form extension core type choice type choicetype php l 411 l411
stof yep i meant returning another element of the array returning the full array would be done by solution 1 which adds a completely new method avoiding the current method s signature to change unfortunately from what i ve understood of 7312 it does not seems to fix my issue because i have no idea of what kind of i ps ips will be in the x forwarded for because of the multi cdn structure in place there s not even a range of i ps ips i could filter on they really are unknown and non guessable so i can t use the trusted proxies option i don t know all the history behind the security issue that has been solved by the trusted proxies option but is the array pop a part of the solution to it if not then it shouldn t block the second suggestion if it does then i don t know how i could solve my issue without touching this line and any other suggestion would be more then welcomed about the th 3th option is it really a bc break to add a new optional parameter to a function i thought it wasn t we could have something like this https gist github com gnutix 5144860 i m not very used to closures so the code example is probably not perfect or even working it s just to give you an idea 
don t know why after updating some bundles this error disappeared thanks 
thanks for quick reply tobion and stof i don t think we ve made any significant configuration changes i did a grep over our code base and outside of symfony core get route collection getroutecollection is only called in allowed methods router loader allowedmethodsrouterloader php of fos rest bundle fosrestbundle version 0100 we did implement a custom router for subdomains but it does not alter the behavior of get route collection getroutecollection at the moment we re wondering if this misbehaviour could be related to subdomains anyway in which case using symfony 22 should solve this maybe 
i ll try to create a symfony project reproducing this bug will be back in a few minutes 
stof i cleared the cache now can reply you later javiereguiluz is not my case dont use http cache use render esi to render blocks but not cache http properly no doctrine cache this is a large system 253 tables 23 proprietary bundles but is used by few users around 300 and few external daily accesses it s worrying me because soon you will have a lot of external access
i ask for a absolute path and the component returns a url is not a bug 
o kthanks okthanks symfony running under nginx linux the nginx config  log format my symfony com remote addr remote user time local request  status body bytes sent http referer  http user agent http x forwarded for server listen 80 server name my symfony com index index html index htm index php default html default htm default php root opt case symfony symfony web 
only fos user bundle fosuserbundle 
of course i m just not sure about the wanted behavior can we just accept null values in set message id setmessageid method 
i m not too great with colors myself and just throwing ideas out here but if you want to have a theme that is similar to the symfony documentation you could use this on the very right is a set of colors i found in the css file vardumper theme https cloud githubusercontent com assets b b e 22444804817744b7347b0e eeb 5eeb e c a 11e48c6a f c f png 8f6813c76f81png 
that s why it s confusing because after comes command name when i do help i expect help on the entire console app not help on help i would expect to get this with the following syntax symfony help help see also previous point that using help i expect information on the app help should give information on which commands there are and a short description of them otherwise it s pretty useless help that mainly seems to give help on itself see previous 2 points i see also you can also output the help in other formats by using the format option no it doesn t because that information should come when you do console help not console list 
migrating from 21 to 23 updated bundles a minute ago problem still exists 
ok it seems that i m not the only one with this misunderstanding but yes i m already switched to content location although i don t think it s always the cleaner solution for caching in a distributed system i attach a version number to the entities which is changed if someone writes to it so i would like to respond to patch put requests with an location to the entity with the new version number or with an 409 conflict and an location header if the client uses not the current version number i think it s quite annoying that i can set the headers in symfony but the client get s a modified result from php but ok i no one else has a problem with it we can close it 
hacfi we are using fos user bundle fosuserbundle for user management our session is cached in memcache 
it happens f e when  the fos http cache bundle route used to generate a user hash is protected by a firewall rule and sf http cache is on which then will trigger the subrequest to fos user context hash when the user visits login  in an e z publish ezpublish application one of the controllers used for subrequests tries to load a content from the repository which the user does not have access to
this happened in 2 custom bundles so it s easy to fix as far as i can tell the exceptions are 100 legit just shouldn t break compatibility with with 33
master but if you look well the composer json in src symfony component http kernel httpkernel is not in sync with the composer json in which is actually fixed in the pull request running composer install dev or composer update from the src symfony component http kernel httpkernel means that the templating component won t be fetched and thus the tests will fail when running phpunit i suspect that there are other similar issues with the other components but i don t have the time right now to fix every composer json file in symfony symfony
sure as composer i m using this one symfony symfony 23 minimum stability stable let me know if something 
don t really know insight support told me they use symfony yaml parser component 
symfony 233 full stack 
nicolas grekas yes here is a broken app https github com nykopol broken app you just have to go to the default controller i noticed that this only occur if the listener depends on doctrine orm entity manager 
sure i ll give it a try the only thing bothering me is how the twig service should be declared though if there is no bundle declaring it locally to the profiler more specifically for its configuration cache  but i ll try to figure that out 
one must override get cache dir getcachedir and get log dir getlogdir in app kernel appkernel to set the cache log directories the only way to use this with memcache would be to write a custom stream wrapper additionally in the filesystem component one of the methods utilized by the cache https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony component filesystem filesystem php l 451 l451 calls the app engine restricted tempnam function https developers google com appengine docs php php disabled functions rendering it useless 
i dont know what went wrong but after i cleared the cache complettly i checked it again and the error was gone as i already described it happened for a simple collection with more than one field in form type after i added asserts to each field so if someone have the same error in the future clear the cache 
i wrote a simple unit test that triggers the same bug and almost the same fatal error call to undefined method closure get wrapped listener getwrappedlistener in the symfony version i m using i have to figure out which versions are affected after that i ll send a pr
no as i don t want to touch license file which are very specific and imho should only be handled by project leaders

i am currently using the ldap firewall with a database provider the provider checks if the user exists in the database then ldap firewall checks if he exists in the ldap my problem is that it seems to not be possible to check multiple dn strings on the ldap 
i am trying to create a test but i am not able to make it working in symfony component form tests extension validator constraints form validator test formvalidatortest i would like to create a form with a single field and submit it a blank value in order to check if the not blank notblank constraint is properly working then we should have to change the submit by form submit array false to reproduce the issue 
it was a twig extension to get the locale full name can t exactly remember how i got it but worked on my computer i ll check 
point taken although it s a shame similar code has to be written a few times i actually found a use case for it outside of symfony in my application code but didn t look into the subtleties 
cordoval it was in a function definition so technically a parse error that couldn t evaluate to false jakzal i m no longer able able to reproduce the error and i ve changed my xdebug configuration a few times since i reported this so if that may indeed have had something to do with it i ll close this for now and re open if it ever shows up again 
unfortunately i coudn t find any study saying what portion of production applications are deployed in a debian like environment i think a large part is the 2012 study concentrates on the development environment the production environment would also be interesting maybe but this is not only a disk full of inodes problem also a security one because a session that is never garbage collected can be reused anytime correct me if i m wrong but i think there is no check of the file mtime when the session is loaded my sessions are reloaded without a glitch a few days later with the famous well this is embarassing firefox page the session save path is redefined why not also define a default session gc probability this can and should of course be configured and a cron task might be more appropriate in environments where such small optimizations are required 
i ve solved it i had an error creating the form assigning the events thanks anyway 
with patch fdfbb 46fdfbb https github com romainneutron symfony commit fdfbbdef ae a d d cba e a 68 46fdfbbdef430ae98a458d581235d4cba0e42a68 is ok 
i ve just got reports that the cache is not invalidating properly i m afraid that the tags are indeed not saved possibly the warning is correct although i ve yet to find out why the cache entries are written correctly but the tag cache entries are not perhaps one of the caches is not able to process the null byte u 0000 u0000 perhaps the bug description is wrong but it s a bug in saving tags instead i ll try to further debug this later this week

yes e s us is not a valid locale i found the problem from error log of nginx it means that client can send the invalid locale may it cause some issues 
pr done https github com symfony symfony pull 11697 info my first pr on symfony 
hi jakzal thanks for replying might be that it is because i use yml files for translation also i think that this problem only happends on 2318 version didn t do much special to my project sorry don t have much experience reporting bugs i ll try to fork the 2318 and reproduce the problem 
weaverryan no problem this is my authenticate function in a class implementing simple form authenticator interface simpleformauthenticatorinterface  it s pretty much a copy and paste from the docs with a few tweaks that flood shield soon to be renamed simply logs errors and handles brute force attempts 
hi jakzal yep i solved this using custom data transformer 
the library https github com klaussilveira gitter blob master lib gitter client php l 69 l69 builds the command line itself and passes it as a string to the process constructor 
hi javiereguiluz thanks for your answer if it is a standard to add a dot at the end of exception message then this should be a requirement 
thanks webmozart for your fast correction and i confirm that it is working now 
ok maybe it would be best to specify passing case as valid on http symfony com doc current components console console arguments html page right now just from reading the docs i can t tell that required argument means argument presence is required but value can be empty wouterj i haven t found any examples of validation on command level extending argv input argvinput just to override validate method doesn t seem like a good idea other ways to introduce application wide validation logic change 
only yaml v 253 v253 via composer 
according to http www ietf org rfc rfc txt rfc3986txt we should also respect host ip literal i pv address ipv4address reg name reg name  unreserved pct encoded sub delims  unreserved alpha digit    
iam using version 253 yes intl is installed and works correct the exception throws only at currency validation 
fine pr updated 
timglabisch your question is the exact issue i was asking about why does symfony try to connect to the database apparently it s because symfony doesn t know what version of the database server you re using and it s connecting in order to find out 
iltar i updated the previous comment with the whole destruct method for review can you explain what you mean with write stream you mean the handle is it possible to unlink the file before releasing the lock as in the second so example that would prevent race conditions maybe even a blocking lock  the moment we get the lock we need to check if the inode of the file on disk is the same as the one from our handle 
code 
here is a rough example hope it makes sense https gist github com pharman d b eb ed 58 d5150b997eb87257ed58 i appreciate that it s possible to define a factory service but to me it feels like it could be provided at framework level 
jaytaph i would gladly provide it however there is nothing added to dev log
sure here is my firewall config 
i persist the form components formcomponents date and time in sql as date and time so there is no timezone information needed stof is right doctrine will translate me the date or time to an php datetime object because php could not known do better i think this object will be created with the server default timezone with commit 1 https github com symfony symfony commit fb d e ecf f cc a 53 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53 my form looks like this builder add utcdate date array required false is always utc the form will give me back a datetime object with utc timezone now i have the problem that for doctrine the entity has been modified because of the timezone offset to fix this problem a add two new doctrine dbal types ut cdate type utcdatetype  ut ctime type utctimetype witch will translate the database values to an php datetime object with utc timezone this solution worked perfekt for me no more problems with timezones for time date components and the server default timezone can be changed at any time with the changes of commit 2 https github com symfony symfony commit c a a a df e be bddaafc daf 98 1c4a75a00a86df3e17979be86bddaafc108daf98 the form will create the php datetime object with the server default timezone again and the timeoffset ist back again should be no problem with commit 3 https github com symfony symfony commit c a a a df e be bddaafc daf 98 1c4a75a00a86df3e17979be86bddaafc108daf98 i will use the option view timezone to get it back in utc builder add utcdate date array required false view timezone utc but this did not work i am new to symfony so i am realy not sure i think the options model timezone and view timezone are missing in f e line 6061 in file https github com symfony symfony blob src 26src symfony component form extension core type date type datetype php before commit 1 https github com symfony symfony commit fb d e ecf f cc a 53 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53 the two options are present with options model timezone options view timezone  and now https github com symfony symfony commit fb d e ecf f cc a 53 849fb2998485639d253e2438ecf78f62cc833a53 null null  hopefully i am not totally wrong and sorry for the bad english 
could be solution and should technically be possible but do we want this what do you think fabpot 
if you create a single checkbox e g i agree privacy policy and set it to non required in template  you will see how odd it looks like as i said form errors form  must be removed from bootstrap horizontal 4horizontal layout html twig to avoid duplicate error message printing for it i did not check other templates 
looks like using uri http serversforhackers com over rode the http host and thinking about it now that makes sense my test is not an accurate portrayal of what an http request received behind a proxy would look like creating my rest request like this request request create http localhost tag 8888tag proxy get server over rides serveroverrides null generated fully passing tests it seems i broke the request class by not implementing http correctly or as a real world case would be in my test request seems reasonable that the request class shouldn t cover http being done wrong on my end d thanks for pointing these out to me really appreciate your time 
yeah if it s configurable in some way that is fine or maybe declare queue on publish 
you are right i mixed up menu name and menu name menuname thus i added menu name into form i was getting no error since no menu name property existed thanks guys 
v 306 v306 and dev master 
ocramius very naive and overly demanding comment on my part i don t feel right that i have to be wary of using the final keyword just because of the way my class is registered to a dic i ve already faced this issue several times when using doctrine i always felt very annoyed by that 
thanks for your feedback i ll try to get my hands on it probably not before july th 8th if the timing is ok for you i ll update the test suites and then try to fix it the router being a complex component maybe i ll ask for some help thanks
nothing s finished but i began this https github com symfony symfony compare master guilhem n guilhemn tags i made a class per tag and it resulted to 
ro nl ro0nl i don t think it s a problem everything that worked before will still work 
xabbuh run the method in a loop  ceil 6160 will produce 2 the method should be using floor but doing so is still incorrect since the loop iteration has already passed the singular form 
no i ve checked 264 and that version is fine also i ve checked x 27x dev and the same error occurs there although the output is slightly different with 2 exceptions shown instead of one btw forgot to mention but all of this is using php 5511 on windows 81
so the problem probably lies in the fact that the supervisor processes still look at the old container folder in memory problem 
i can t reproduce it yet so my explanation must be wrong still investigating 
xabbuh yes but that sounds like a workaround too i can t think of a use case where it s useful to merge fallbacks thinking 
you want some reading have fun and thanks a lot 
not on this field here is the field on the form 
sorry if bad explained i validate with group electronic register what happens on properties only assert containing group electronic are triggered not blank notblank on program name programname is not validated because it has only register group expected all assert containing either electronic or register group should be triggered 
i agree that ignoring an error is quite fragile but when you already know about the well known errors in one of your dependencies be notified stopping the execution through a context error exception contexterrorexception about these unfixable errors everytime doesn t help please note that i m not proposing to not collect those errors but just not throwing an exception for them not really sometimes old libraries seems to become abandoned and have very old p rs prs trying to fix these kind of issues and there is nothing i could do about that at least not without maintaining a fork with the fixes by my own 
no i don t no data transformers and no listeners subscribers however the primary key of my entity car is special
stof actually there was something really strange because composer show symfony was saying my symfony http kernel is 411 but i ve found out that in composer lock i had 411 in symfony lock i had 408 and symfony component http kernel httpkernel kernel version was 408 and it was displayed on dev welcome page i had removed both lock files whole vendor dir run composer update from scratch and now it s ok 411 is displayed on welcome page and profiler works really really weird 
tobion i use symfony 271 i don t have a custom form theme and i don t want to use one the disadvantage is that the whole form label widget has to be overriden if symfony changes the logic i have to change it too it s too much overhead and i also don t override any existing form block the current form label widget contains the logic for not rendering labels if label is set to false so an extra condition to translation domain false is enough for all labels choice translation domain false doesn t work because it will only override the original translation domain in the form view the template logic is not affected 
xabbuh symfony version 283 jakzal yes it seems to be the issue 
correct i have not been able to recreate the bug in native so far but i will be running the servers on native for a few days to see if it shows up for anyone 
sure the hardest part is actually providing unit test for this since now i know exactly what is happening i think the shortest example which can be included in test suite is this  wdyt

dmaicher yes i did it works fine with command tester i need the same for application tester 
i had to re read the docs a couple of times i think it isn t clear at all about this i added the class name classname so my group sequence groupsequence always returns an array with this group and all works i think the docs should be clearer about this that when using group sequences groupsequences and not returning the class name classname simply doesn t validate the asserts without any group assigned to them if i have time ill try some rewording myself 
hi thanks for your time and comments actually i was thinking of this feature when i was working on my project and debuging my app with my log we have some specific monolog channels cart where we log the cart add item or cart validation during the checkout process and finding the actual cart channel was hard indeed i do cmd f for that hope my explanations are more precises
nicolas grekas that has indeed fixed the issue is that expected behaviour then 
aitboudad yup  15527 fixes the issue for me
i know this cannot be solved with code but it can be clarified in the docs which is a bit vague at the moment and i know it isn t symfony s job to tell me how to organize a webserver but as i read the docs it doesn t feel like a proper solution now 
nicolas grekas i will try to check what i can do the project is huge with so many public and private bundles it does not give me any option to expose the whole thing i will try to reduce everything to a single 1 file bundle and see if i can reproduce the error from there best of luck is that i can which means the issue is due to only long running if not then it will be one hell of a task to try disabling each bundle one by one with all the configs that go with them to see which one is the culprit for sure though this does not happen before 3419 simply switching back to 3418 fixes it 
hell it s deeper that i think thank you for pointing so i think it s easier for now to workaround than wait for fix 
not per se the issue as the error describes is that the parser thinks the current context is an object node when it should still be the same array as the previous item was declared in an empty line should not affect that 
iltar the route annotation is not working either the same happens when i put them on class level 
i expected this was a symfony bug but it sounds like you re suggesting it s a laravel issue this selector is generated by laravel s crawler trait crawlertrait https github com laravel framework blob b a src b83830a551src illuminate foundation testing crawler trait crawlertrait php l 1044 l1044 while the id is invalid the name selector is the correct name of the form field so i d expect it to match

perfect that s exactly what i wanted 
i meant return contract object with the value of quantity with 3859999999999999875655021241982467472553253173828125 where contract is the entity with quantity if i do dump contract  the value in the entity is good with 386 if i change the type with string in the entity i have 386 so the issue is with decimal mode
structurally that looks right i can easily understand the syntax ooi the reverse order option is input option inputoption value none in my example would it be necessary to have a new command class that suggests input processing is done in the command class maybe a better option would be to have an input processor inputprocessor that returns an object obeying input interface inputinterface

i spend some time with this removing vendor and do clean install helps probably something wrong with update sorry to bother 
it is a fresh installation done via composer nothing added nor removed 
i need to install symfony in version 28 because of an old php version 5317 when i do this via composer the bundles are installed according to composer lock at least the reference for doctrine orm in composer lock is faulty and does not return the requested version which would be 248 but the actual one the actual version requires php 54 but symfony 28 requires 539 i hope it s clear now 
i ve checkout git master and run composer update to be able to run unit tests so you have the composer json on your own 
ugh yes it is a version problem build phase lied to me thanks folks 
sorry did not realize this is dupe of https github com symfony symfony issues 21549 yes https github com symfony symfony pull 21556 does fix the issue do you have a recommendation how to fix this temporarily until the new release with this fixed comes 
because php requirement will be fixed in these versions composer doesn t install dependencies for which you don t fullfill platform criteria 
i think that the only use for this enhancement is when you don t dump the url matcher urlmatcher if i m not mistaken sf group routes when you dump right 
the form should render like this imo screenshot 20160411 10 43 https 53https cloud githubusercontent com assets ac f ffd e ba c a a db e 165154144215135ac58f28ffd211e59ba2c13a2a62db2e png these are the form types used but i not sure what side effects that will cause 
alexander schranz y that s exactly what i was thinking 
i ll try
container of debian gnu linux 99 stretch 
well i suppose one of a there is a way to clear a requirement either null or something else i m not aware of the docs should be fixed to mention this b there is no correct way to clear a requirement but using null works to clear a requirement but it s an unintended effect this should be adopted and documented c there is no correct way to clear a requirement using null works but should not be relied upon this is a missing feature 
i do not but maybe i have something weird in my config i ll double check it edit nope i used the standard config from symfony standard so no issues there 
thanks a lot i forgot to uncomment the config 
xabbuh uploaded sample project see https github com jguntenaar symfony issue sample 19209sample project for code and procedure to reproduce in readme md file 
xabbuh that fixed it thank you 
i assumed it was part of var dumper vardumper is it not here is the dom screen shot 20160728 at 1 31 48 pm https cloud githubusercontent com assets bd e dde 8735617226654bd7e1dde c e c d ee png 54c711e68055c5d6491ee629png if this is not apart of var dumper vardumper i apologize 
jameshalsall but the code i used above returns header 301 and i m here to discuss if the example above shouldn t be in success class edit i meant instead of returning 301 the route component return 200 bhavin nakrani you meant foo root if so all u gotta do is use only in route annotation above the action sorry be this short but type code using tablet is a pain hehe just add this method to the class example i created in st 1st post 
sstok i was just coding up a pr to introduce a new parse flag parse exception on duplicate
i just checked in on dev 41dev and it is still reproducible 
the use case is that i consume from a kafka topic and might have to retry the message due to other messages still missing before i can process that very message so a retry is needed as kafka is write ahead it doesn t make sense to produce the message to the same kafka topic again as this can screw things up in an event stream therefor i would need to store the messages to retry somewhere else than in the original kafka topic unfortunately i m currently tied to version 43 so i can t use the latest x 44x dev branch of symfony messenger any other workaround which works for 43 as well 
i could open another pr for that but if i am reading it right bugfixes should go to version branches only perhaps they merge 31 back into master from time to time 
the difficulty for me is that i dont know where to start or look i code in phpstorm 20163 and i even cant put breakpoint to stop before redirection 
today latest i think just checked out from teamcity work dir here is a dac c f b bc d abae d d a 28a00dac0c396f2880b84bc33d7abae698d4d94a
the session was not enabled in the framework session config with everything works as expected on 34 beta 2 my fault but with flex you have to be much more attentive not to forget to enable things i was testing other stuff so far and didn t think of the session at all 
let s take the example of a controller event listener for example  public static function get subscribed events getsubscribedevents return kernel events kernelevents controller on kernel controller onkernelcontroller  if i add a wrong argument on my function let s say i put public function on kernel controller onkernelcontroller filter user response event filteruserresponseevent event  inspite of public function on kernel controller onkernelcontroller filter controller event filtercontrollerevent event  in that case the error code is regards epixilog
the submit type submittype works without problem i fixed my problem also by writing this into my fields html twig  but i just thought that the behavior i encountered is not the desired one so i opened an issue 
i had a problem installing http foundation httpfoundation v 32 v32 alongside http kernel httpkernel v 28 v28 though it looks like i m able to upgrade the http kernel httpkernel component to v x v3x after all 
hi after investigate more in depth i see the problem come with the file response you can found my project here https github com nunopress sharex hosting uploader the problem working with export symfony env prod and use the app php file when you try to see a files after cache created with return this file file filename inline  https files nunopress com view png 211120161479725953png i tried too with return new binary file response binaryfileresponse file 200 but the problem still 
thank you for super quick response yes it actually fixes the issue i will open a pr
dmaicher thank you for response  after you send body content at the price of slowing php s output layer a bit this is not that case because headers are sent before the body content headers sent function returns true only when headers were sent for instance when i do echo text before i output anything it will return false i have output buffering off in php ini in my case what is happening 1 header content type text html charset utf 8 2 headers sent  returns false 3 header content type text html charset utf 8 4 echo some error as a result header content type is duplicated i get fcgi error 
nicolas grekas i ve just created this repo that illustrates the problem excuse my code quality i tried to do it as fast as i could https github com vlahanas url generator testing urlgeneratortesting you can also see an online illustration of it here https url symfony testing herokuapp com as you can notice althouth the url is https the generated url is http 
i tried to do that in the extension and it works but i want to keep warming the templates only if the form extension service is enabled and i cannot check it in the extension because the service isn t available there but if it isn t big problem with warming the templates when the extension is disabled we can do it in the extension 
lmasforne yep that error in one of my test i m testing user creation for that i need one user who is creating new user account second user who tests the actual creation by logging in and in the end first user deletes newly created account could this error be made not to trigger under test environment at least 
nicolas grekas i ll try that tonight currently at work so cannot test that now 
rolling back the changes from 21053 fixes it for me 
yes related to both commented in https github com symfony symfony pull 21556 sorry for the duplicate 
i was only able to reproduce it with this java jar call actual result it throws an exception after 60 seconds expected result either receiving an exception that the stdin pipe went away instantly after it happens or the class checks if the command is outputting data to stdout or error and handles this optimum output in this case would be application pdf 
i tried to replicate the issue and it seems that you have found the solution eg wrapping call into profiler dump helped output for profile getcollector request requestattributes get controller  is would you like to fix it or should i fix it and create pull request 
jakzal when i make default on annotation work but no in yml xabbuh i don t no where is problem
nek that would be awesome dmaicher no it s not jakzal they are two seperate applications just think of a reverse proxy setup symfony rproxy setup https cloud githubusercontent com assets ab d b d e a 73740124097560ab9d96b40d6611e7982a cc bdf b png 72cc30bdf1b0png since the servers don t have their application in the root directory but are in a subdir and there s nothing like x forwarded path the generated ur ls urls are wrong so my intention is to only generate the app path in this example image small 4711small like mentioned by nek and yes this is kind of a workaround for a missing x forwarded path header hope i could describe my problem 
found the relevant issue there https github com symfony symfony docs issues 7526 thanks 
str 1 add on kernel response onkernelresponse listener 2 in this listener add csp header to response instance with directive style src self 3 load index page in dev mode with web profiler bundle webprofilerbundle 4 open dev tools in chrome go to console tab actual result error message from op expected result no errors also i confirm 20963 isue hash value in nonce hash directive is not the same as in html script tag that loads web profiler bundle webprofilerbundle maybe this is important in my case 
dmaicher looks like you re right i disabled cache in the chrome s dev panel and it works fine with disabled cache any ideas how to deal with this 
so i looked into writing a test and potentially fixing this if it were a bug but actually while looking at the tests surrounding this method it is clear that what i expected this method to do and what is actually does is different i expected that when using use attribute as key useattributeaskey name false and supply this  note that the key that key was added to the body array even though i didn t manually supply it anyway after looking in to it i am good with closing this although i think the above might be a good feature potentially the documentation around the method especially on the site should be clearer 
nicolas grekas it s dumped correctly but it receive itself what causes to infinity loop at runtime get chain populator service getchainpopulatorservice php 
i have to run the compiler pass with the definition decorator definitiondecorator at the pass config passconfig type optimize stage so that it has access to the doctrine s entity manager is there any way i can make it work in this case 
xabbuh yes it fixes but with composer update or install i ve the same file with bug i think it because a tag v 332 v332 points to previous commit 
step by step from zero 1 download from symfony com installer 2 do setup 3 manually configure db at asd app config parameters yml 4 do rapid install 5 add manually to test php 6 try http localhost asd web app dev php test edit 1edit 7 see error something like that p s http localhost asd web config php shows only one notification
tobion you are right i just re read it and it does sound confusing i wanted to explain how this site works and why it is so fast i did it because nicolas grekas was interested in that and i don t have a blog so i am closing it and when i make this as a bundle i might create new rfc with link only however i think the idea of autowired service locators for tagged services is still something very usable and would like to see in the core 
xabbuh i added just a normal registration form with email user name username password field and locale select and a register button i entered normal data nothing special no german umlaut or special chars i couldnt really figure out a logic behind that error it seems to fail random 
hi xabbuh i am currently not on my main developer machine unfortunately i tried to reproduce the error on another machine but it failed everything works will try again next week on my main machine in the meantime if i can not reproduce the error locally can i conclude that its source may be the environment e g php config instead of symfony i am wondering because i didn t use stderr myself 
sorry i totally confused the versions i was working with version 328 and downgraded to version 326 both showed this problem image https cloud githubusercontent com assets d c e b da aa a b png 2657385264198755703d27440c111e780b185da1aa0a5b9png i have some files in the tmp directory which are not readable the file permissions are somehow scrambled this probably will be fixed as soon as the hoster cleans the tmp directory so i would expect a fopen permission denied error indeed when i uncomment the silencing of the error reporting on line 72 i get a few of these error notifications since i cannot open read chmod this file although it exists grafik https cloud githubusercontent com assets aba e d f df png 2657385264389774298aba6412611e79d9471982f74df05png but the silencing of the error reporting triggers a mistake when in this section 7282 the error reporting is silenced the errors are not handled when there is a file permission problem the handler this handle would not be set this is checked on line 84 here it throws an error which is good but the message is crap a critical notice  this notice using the contao request token requesttoken class has been deprecated and will no longer work in contao 50 has nothing to do with the error which is triggered this is since the error error get last on line 85 fetches the last notice which is not important at all and not the true error which was silenced due to shutting down the error handling in the few lines before 
ro nl ro0nl no right now it s in a private repository i m not too familiar with php doc extractor phpdocextractor but i d assume it only parses the php doc phpdoc blocks and not the type itself i m not sure if i understand your question
xabbuh i still work on it i ve started the stof solution there s some good evolution but i still need to do some refactoring of the old code
yes i am using  and i was not be able to pass kernel interface kernelinterface could write me a clear example that will be very helpful and kind of you regards 
nicolas grekas sorry but i tried to configure that but i still have the same problem  i tried to set the prod and dev monolog yml file to default by does not work 
dmaicher i think i told you a way how to reproduce it run few ajax at the same time if i add some delay then it works so this is apparently a problem with reading session files at the same time this behaviour i have on 4 different servers and only after upgrade to sf 41 sf41 i use native symfony session i didnt introduce nothing by myself romulus ed 69 romulused69 i didnt have that section in my framework yml file at all but i added it and it was the same then i uncommented it and again the same 
i copied your code and paste it into symfony 332 works well no longer displays a warning 
hello the error is trigger when calling client request  the parameter entity is the expected entity the article object both properties exist supplier and reference supplier is unchanged compared to the fixture reference is set to null as no data is provided 
that s why i used the generate function mentioned in the docs so the casing and placement wasn t the issue i created a project with 330 and did the same steps without any problems 
yes too long time in empty controller why 
the exact order in the template manager templatemanager s template exists templateexists is  if the loader implements twig loader exists loader interface existsloaderinterface then the exists method is called if the loader implements twig loader source context loader interface sourcecontextloaderinterface then the get source context getsourcecontext method is called if neither condition above is met the get source getsource method is called this is only present in twig x 1x it was in that last condition that the linked sylius issue was filed from

yes i am sorry basically this question includes all the translatable components of symfony but the particular issue i ve stumbled on was with validator s messages in the form component 
great thanks for the link i saw the php 708 in the composer json file resulted from running the commant composer create project symfony skeleton after it breaks because of the php requirement i will use the slack channel 
thanks for the help you were right the problem came from the autoconfigure to true by default i found a really specific solution to my problem the ultimate goal is to overwrite the get user getuser of all controllers i use get subscribed services getsubscribedservices to have access to one of my services without using di in the constructor i can remove the declaration of this abstract controller from my services yml no bug
curry 684 curry684 thanks for the response however after composer req symfony flex i m still not getting the desired phpunit any thoughts on what i should do next thanks 
yup the same issue closing 
xabbuh i added priority like this pre services app bundle fosuser redirect class app bundle appbundle event listener eventlistener fos user redirect listner fosuserredirectlistner arguments  request stack tags  name kernel event subscriber priority 1 pre but result is the same as before the project pre git clone https github com tony fenton tonyfenton analyses git cd analyses composer update php bin console doctrine schema create pre and on the bottom on the page will be error call to a member function get locale getlocale on null 
xabbuh stof thanks for your help you were right it isn t used so it doesn t cause any problem the problem was another bundle nico haase nicohaase yes i saw it and i didn t say that i m using it thanks

hi i updated the issue with the code it s always parsed as an assoc array so i think it s not a yaml string problem thanks 
nevermind i tried using the latest bootstrap 4 released and it works correctly
yes that the solution thank you 
after thinking about it the behavior actually makes sense if there is no templating engine you can not define error pages to be displayed so the fw doesn t know what to return in that case but the issue of showing the error in the output of phpunit after adding templating still remains 
curry 684 curry684 thank you you are right extending from controller makes full container available never thought about this 
does 25398 work 
apparently the filter only applies to values fetched from env but the argv array is already present in env from the line env getenv line yes i ll provide a reproducer today 
ok its right date time datetime create from format createfromformat works fine but new date time datetime 1212201 throws an exception i m not sure if this is intended behavior or a php bug my assumption straight from the docs was that i could pass a validated string to the date time datetime constructor 
when we install the bundles to create a basic symfony application into some subtree of project the symfony flex https github com symfony flex copy create update files into project dir files such as bundle php and configuration files in case of a test application the path is not the same of the compose json file where they aways create update copy the files specified into the respective recipes https github com symfony recipes bundle 
config  and my bad duplication only appears if field has validation error 
sorry after more digging it seems to be my mistake caused by template inheritance inside my custom template

i don t know exactly configuration of reader servise required on compile phase i m not shure about details of this process i ll try to create same issue in doctrine annotations tracker on next week thank you
painreign the boot method in your app s kernel you can add the method in 
hi xabbuh i ve tried to reproduce issue on small example framework templating doctrine the bug isn t reproduced looks like some another third party bundle in my project failed while warmed and console command just silently stopped i m think this behavior was introduced with 25117 while i was trying play with composer dependencies broken lib was updated and fixed and bug no more reproduced 
i am actually going to close this issue out after doing some more digging i realized that when i initially installed the security bundle it was not installed using composer req security instead it was installed with the lexik jwt lexikjwt package this did not fully implement all the necessary classes resolved the issue by making sure to run composer req security and composer require doctrine doctrine bundle i can leave it open if it makes sense to understand why the packages did not play nicely with eachother
yes
hello i also tried to reproduce my own problem without any success at first time digging it deeper it might be a sign of some another bug the error only happens in php 71 php71 with xdebug on it s ok in php 72 php72 with or without xdebug and in php 71 php71 without xdebug hope it helps 
it happens on a bigger closed source project i am working on i m currently trying to figure out the cause by updating each package individually i hope to be able to give more details soon 
thank you for your information  i removed a directory and installed packages again rm rf vendor  composer install then i have just confirmed that it is normal
xabbuh i expect a pdo exception pdoexception because in this case that s a pdo exception pdoexception that is thrown which the authentication service is catching then rethrowing using a new exception type linaori i m fully ok with your statement but authentication utils authenticationutils get last authentication error getlastauthenticationerror does not use a name explaining that it s an exception that is returned authentication utils authenticationutils get last authentication exception getlastauthenticationexception would do for example also my code is not ready for production environment and we use it only on dev env to check all errors we can currently encounter thanks anyway so how can i do if i want to test what kind of exception is thrown to create a custom message do i need to do something like that 
yes i will submit it today thanks 
consider a delete button which should do a delete request you do post to article 35 using a form perhaps even spoof the http method to delete using form component yes you could do a js asynchronous call but i am talking pure html way of doing it then your form is pretty much
tobion first i wanted to dispatch a new message inside consumer that became possible with the last update dispatch after current bus middleware but i still have absolutely different middleware stack for sending and receiving messages in case of one bus i have to use if in every middleware to check whether it is sending or receiving imo it s better to put ifs into configuration of different buses 
this one will resolve my problem i do not know is the best solution 
never mind somehow a public folder was created within pdutel src and in spite that mamp server was directed to pdutel public it still threw the error 
please find it at this repository https github com bernard a bernarda skeleton 
indeed there is a deprecation warning when i use this private service i was suprised to have an exception without compiler pass compilerpass and no exception with it this is definitely not a bug thanks for your answer 
simply install skeleton remove vendor packages then replace composer and install again clear cache see error have tested with https symfony com doc current setup html and composer file provided in issue description error always for
ooops the error was in a customized template thank you very much 
here it is created test project with simple form that user bootstrap 4 horizontal form https github com chepainais sf bs file sf4bs4file field did not used tested on earlier versions
since i don t use providers i don t but i m guessing that they can t give you this information in real time since they probably don t send the message synchronously well running your own smtp server is certainly the more professional way so why not have some convenience methods or bonus features that only work with smtp 
i have  an if in my base template to display the user a link to their personal page  a success message in the response generated by my on logout success onlogoutsuccess you were logged out displaying such a message is the core functionality of a success handler i would say result since the response is created when the token is still there the final page says can it be that this bug is the very reason why the target option was invented https symfony com doc security 44security html logging out cause i can t see any benefit in redirecting the user other than postponing the creation of the final response until the token is gone for sure if i m right about this the target option could be dropped then maybe the token could be passed as second optional argument to on logout success onlogoutsuccess in https github com symfony symfony blob src 44src symfony component security http firewall logout listener logoutlistener php l 95 l95 this would make everybody happy 
no it does not the two comment blocks need to be there 
i just commited everything on my repo https github com lebadapetru learning symfony learningsymfony the form rendering takes place in templates setup wizard html twig the data is sent to the view through the setup wizard controller setupwizardcontroller php where i m using the form class setup wizard type setupwizardtype php to build the form 
my non shared service represents complex s operations on third party api with a session these operations are used by some manager who determine how to send the request in our tests we only want to check if the complex s operations are well craft but the operations depends on other services with no need to mock for testing 
no it doesn t work quotes are not stripped from the value the value is shown with quotes in php environment and xdebug fails to process that this value is read by docker compose and passed to the container with the following option  so i guess it s docker compose not stripping the quotes 
no i didn t change anything to vendor i just deleted the directory and made a composer install to generate it again same result yes i pasted it in plain text here is a screenshoot and yes i get it on the exception page no debug toolbar no profiler just the plain error page like on the screen and i get it for every type of exception here is a cache problem i was installing it but i get it for 404 errors routing problems etc my problem is the exception message i s always about this previous property of error i i really want to find the real problem i need to check the hanfle exception hanfleexception line of the debug trace in the screenshoot i have a cache exception cacheexception for example image https user images githubusercontent com b b e 339398041474950b2010b7e bd 70bd e e b f d d png 11e88e729b408f6d37d2png 
yep i can give a try
have done https github com symfony validator pull 23
however i think there is a problem the command is only executed by the developer to have the info of his environment
i would is preferred solution to skip authentication of already authenticated user 
actually  in https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge php unit phpunit bootstrap php l 38 l38 will only report environment variables from the shell at that moment parameters from phpunit xml are probably not parsed yet as far as i understand the code and i might be completely off on this the problem is that in https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge php unit phpunit deprecation error handler deprecationerrorhandler php l 104 l104 the mode parameter is reset to 0 because of https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge php unit phpunit deprecation error handler deprecationerrorhandler php l 57 l57 not recognizing disabled as a valid value for mode trying to parse an integer fails and falls back to 0 in consequence mode will never be set to disabled in https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bridge php unit phpunit deprecation error handler deprecationerrorhandler php l 105 l105

xabbuh sure i thought the bundle is handled as a symfony component i have re submitted the bug to https github com symfony webpack encore bundle issues 31
i m not sure we want the pid file to be deleted when running cache clear do we the server will keep running after the cache has been wiped but we would loose track of it this pid file holds server state and in the linux philosophy this would belong to directory run https refspecs linuxfoundation org fhs fhs 30fhs ch s html ch03s15html i guess but there is no such run or var run directory in symfony s default directory structure any objection to use the project directory as the default pid file location 
hum i did not in my config folder i have a bunch of maybe i m wrong but it seems to be related to this bug 29461 contracts extract locale aware interface localeawareinterface out of translator interface translatorinterface nicolas grekas 
ok done hopefully i got the paperwork mostly right 
it seems i can only simulate it in my private repo as well what i do notice is that the route that is not working is located in the regex list regexlist of src dev debug project container url matcher srcdevdebugprojectcontainerurlmatcher php do match domatch but i don t know what the reason is for a route to move there instead of the initial switch statement and can t simulate it with a test app 
hi nicolas confirmed dev 34dev fixes the problem
i thought the same i don t know what was the exact problem but i have updated composer from 172 to 186 and the problem is gone no errors now 
will do 
debug autowiring tells me so in total four router default class router and one router request context class request context requestcontext url generator interface urlgeneratorinterface url matcher interface urlmatcherinterface router interface routerinterface request context aware interface requestcontextawareinterface will all give back vendor symfony routing router php why not only router interface routerinterface chalasr yes you are right
xabbuh done while creating it i discovered a connection with a custom twig extension in which the same non shared service is injected if you remove the prismic extension prismicextension the test environment shows no error the application is set to test in env change it to dev to see a working one zip 29628zip https github com symfony symfony files zip 269484329628zip 
hi i m sorry for being late i made an example application that has an same error you can checkout it here https github com xaro forum xaro93forum
yeah i m embarrassed of course it s about the php version to someone else who could fool himself with such issue i was using docker and i was using the php fpm dev 73dev image which was not updated for some time once i ve upgraded to the latest stable 732 version everything is working as expected 
nicolas grekas yes it works also i work in docker on windows if it matters
hi sorry for the delay when responding this is the field 
yup i realized it was exactly that when everything started working after deleting another voter which tutor used just to explain something it was a file with function but no return in it surprisingly in his case symphony 404 there was no problem 
this is a sonata admin class which is rendering the form protected function configure form fields configureformfields form mapper formmapper form mapper formmapper  form mapper formmapper add name null array required  false add binary content binarycontent file type filetype class array required  false  hope this can help you 
yes i tried manually deleting the cache on production and the problem still occurs i also tried setting env prod on my dev system but i still cannot duplicate the problem i can t do much testing on the production server or people quickly start complaining so i m a bit stuck i ve never had any problems with symfony updates up thru 4211 they only occurred when i tried to upgrade to 43 as soon as i roll things back to 4211 production works normally 
derrabus simperfit that change will be to offer the possibility to only check e tag etag or last modified if you only got one of them maybe it is not needed or it is a kind of micro optimization but imo this would stick more to the http doc and so getting the things less complicated when looking at the symfony code have a good weekend 
nicolas grekas i will try 
no i don t know if this is an issue or an assumption when programming the problem is that template email templateemail generates the text of the message when the object is forwarded to mailer interface mailerinterface send where then body renderer interface bodyrendererinterface is launched based on the message event messageevent event the problem with signing such a message is that the method does not return the class that entered the method s mime signer smimesigner sign but we only get an instance of message that is not parsed by body renderer interface bodyrendererinterface and all context and html template htmltemplate are dropped so signing a message in this case has the wrong path because just after signing and sending a message with empty content goes to the given e mail account 
our form type has no any special configuration and date time type datetimetype has defined just the labels 
no it seems like both environmets have this behavior i logged this data 20190514 1158 dev 122 ms 20190514 1212 dev 1140 ms 20190514 1217 dev 119 ms 20190514 1236 dev 4091 ms 20190514 1236 dev 161 ms 20190514 1236 dev 125 ms 20190514 1237 prod 83 ms 20190514 1238 prod 77 ms 20190514 1241 prod 80 ms 20190514 1242 prod 77 ms 20190514 1244 prod 81 ms 20190514 1255 prod 78 ms 20190514 0108 prod 3431 ms 20190514 0109 prod 70 ms 20190514 0117 prod 3560 ms 20190514 0119 prod 79 ms 20190514 0128 prod 77 ms 20190514 0130 prod 82 ms 20190514 0138 prod 3216 ms you can see that cache updated only after 78 minute idle

i had some problems at work so i didn t work on in go ahead and thank you 
dmaicher pointed out the right solution for me i imagined that a simple approach should have been enough but i didn t find that page in the docs informations provided by cfoehrdes are also useful and i m sure that in the future i ll make good use of them so really thank you

namespaced attributes are very useful but imo a bad code smell so long as we get input from the wider symfony community so this is a bottom up and evidenced decision and not imposed from the top i support deprecating them

xabbuh here it is https github com o alquimista symfony test i grabbed the latest symfony demo and applied the necessary changes to src entity post and src controller admin blog controller blogcontroller php at the new method 
xabbuh i m just using php bin console server run which usually does not trigger symfony when requesting an existing file like styles css or images located in public calling controller actions works like charm just requesting sym linked assets does not work copied assets work 
nicolas grekas thanks for short response time symfony support rocks not working for me profiler shows content length to be empty string  by the way i observed probably unrelated behavior when trying to access response get info getinfo debug of the curl http client curlhttpclient i got uncaught type error typeerror argument 1 passed to symfony component mime encoder eight bit content encoder eightbitcontentencoder encode string encodestring must be of the type string resource given called in vendor symfony mime part text part textpart php on line 120 and defined in vendor symfony mime encoder eight bit content encoder eightbitcontentencoder php 31 while accessing debug info of native http client nativehttpclient was just fine 
nicolas grekas it doesn t help it just creates connection with incorrect parameter edit sorry it works i stupidly let there instead of if this is expected behavior it can be closed but redis localhost dbindex 6379dbindex 5 works with revisions made for symfony 4
yes and these didn t change
apparently there used to be an abstract class or just a class then the situation changed and the interface appeared it became necessary to implement session at user class but it needs to be checked on several versions of symfony in my opinion a strange mechanism has been preserved in the new distribution artifact  try to search by vendor there in many places get session getsession is used this raises the relevance of this method to version 43 but in the documentation this session set as far as i remember this code was automatically generated with get session getsession authenticator thank you for understanding 
it seems that the option row attr isn t add in available options of form type formtype class like stof mentionned i m currently working on a pr some tests are failing for the moment 
ok will provide this tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
my specific case is 
thank you for your response i ll give it a try the action called is called undo lost and found action undolostandfoundaction with a capital f while the to call action given in the routing is undo lost andfound undolostandfound with a small letter f the routing component manages to translate undo lost andfound undolostandfound to the undo lost and found action undolostandfoundaction action however it does not inject the translator interface translatorinterface translator 
it s one app but it is running on several ec 2 ec2 instances yes it is a similar request but a little different 
yes problem fixed 
lyrixx thanks for triggering me on that i didn t notice that my proxy configuration already set the x forwarded proto it was just a case of trusting the internal proxy and it worked d
yes we could save the time when the last email was sent with the transport and then compare this with the current time before a new email is sent only if the difference is above a threshold the server will be pinged however i think 10 seconds is still way too low the default timeout is 5 minutes according to rfc https rfc5321https tools ietf org html rfc 5321 rfc5321 section 4532 with a threshold of only 10 seconds it is much more likely that the connection will still be dropped due to too many noop commands than an actual timeout xabbuh this is a bug not a feature 
thanks for your quick reply i d simply extend the workflow yml configuration as follows  of course the fallback would be to not pass an object but a string no translation in this case what do you think

xabbuh i ve checked yes you re right i use tetraweb php docker image that s why my php version was 71 maximum that explains the error message i get nicolas grekas i agree thank you all for participation i appreciate your time 
ah i have been trying to update to 44 and come to conclusion it is working yet then i downgrade to 43 so the config is not removed on downgrade which is right 
here is the example
https github com docker library php blob bac b ca ab de a b e d a ca d bac7b0ca07ab28de2a3b3e8d9a052084ca98937d alpine fpm 72alpine311fpm dockerfile https github com docker library php blob bac b ca ab de a b e d a ca d bac7b0ca07ab28de2a3b3e8d9a052084ca98937d buster 72buster fpm dockerfile seems not to have such configuration
sample application ist here https test pilatusmail ch there is the home site and then there is page 2 that throws an exception due to an undefined twig variable both pages allow access to the profiler via the symfony bar and in both examples navigating within the profiler is not possible sourcecode can be found here https test pilatusmail ch downloads demoapplication zip
sorry i just saw that it s the same issue than  35916 i rolled back to v 444 v444 for now waiting the fix for the next release 
thanks lyrixx i would love to submit a pr do you have any suggestions on how i would approach this do you have a preference on whether the optional config item should be a which events should be fired or a which events shouldn t be fired my current thinking is to add a new method into workflow php called should dispatch event shoulddispatchevent which will be called within each event function such as completed and announce where the event dispatcher eventdispatcher is checked  should dispatch event shoulddispatchevent will be hooked up to the config item mentioned in the original comment events thoughts

your examples worked correctly i was unable to give you access to our stuff as it is subscription based i have found that the problem was being cause by fast click fastclick https github com ftlabs fastclick i removed the fast click fastclick library and the high stock chart legend started working correctly for now i will leave the fast click fastclick library out of our project 
sorry for the slow reply i ve reverted my changes to core and moved them into stock chart stockchart js gim nimble if you need my changes now i believe you could copy them from bmatcuk highcharts com e fe e d ecd c e e a bca 5 e2fe88e9842d703ecd43c983e0e801a14056bca5 into a separate file and then include that file directly after highstock js since my changes just override axis prototype get plot band path getplotbandpath it should work 
having a comment at the top of the file with the settings used to create that file would go a long way but ideally there d be a way to have a config file locally that could be modified a json file text file etc and then a command to build just those modules on the command line similar to the custom build example https github com jquery jquery custom build examples section in the j query jquery docs grunt is useful for this but there are other ways as for the actual download page for example i generated one with pie series pieseries checked but then got highcharts error 17 as if pie s weren t in my file full version works fine then i tried to rebuild it and got k 0k screenshot 20140423 09 24 https 14https cloud githubusercontent com assets fcc fa 976122780170fcc728fa cb e bc cb0311e380bc c a png 14c3a9362461png

sebastianbochan that does seem to have worked i haven t had a chance yet to watch the android device logcat as the code is executing in the web view webview which is how i knew for certain that the onload handler wasn t being called but i m fairly sure that it s doing as it should now so in your own tests on android x 41x with no external resources required externalresourcesrequired parameter you see the same issue i was seeing i e onload not firing but in android x 7x it is firing and with external resources required externalresourcesrequired set to true it works on both if so i m satisfied that it s the same issue and that your solution fixes it furthermore it seems to me from playing with this in chrome desktop and looking at the network tab that setting external resources required externalresourcesrequired to true does not have an effect on caching i was worried that it might force the external resources to be fetched again each time even if cached locally that doesn t seem to be the case let me know if you know otherwise i love it when the solution is straightforward btw are you testing this in an emulator browser stack browserstack it would be handy to know and be able to roadtest this stuff quickly on various versions of android i find the emulators in android studio to be a complete pita to use would be far nicer to test somewhere else especially considering what i m doing is basically just running stuff in a web view webview

highslide software not reliable the animation length varies depending on the data in the chart which isn t static sometimes you get flick either because the duration is too short or too long technically speaking its also a wordaround hack there should be a callback which executes when the animation finishes and this is possible from higcharts end since it does use j query jquery mootools for animations 
already did no changes

i did some research it seems it s error on my end since erase function in hc compares entire object before removal and in my code i first add new y axis yaxis then rebuilding title for it title should contain name of each series axis is assigned to assigning series to new axis and in the end cleanup and redraw every operation is without redraw pretty big dataset and each point usually has additional properties also i tried to remove axis manually but title remains visible
that has worked thank you very much

ah interesting my use case is in my react library that wraps highcharts a highcharts chart in my library would look something like this basically all the components inside highcharts chart highchartschart watch for their props to change if a change occurs they call something context appropriate like this axis set title settitle new title false my use case is that to prevent an excessive amount of redraws i call a debounced redraw function https github com whawker react jsx highcharts blob master packages react jsx highcharts src components base chart basechart base chart basechart js l l 109 l105l109 that tries to limit the number of redraws

hi yes i am sure that i am using settings i ve sent the navigator that you can see is separate chart with it s height set to 0 so only navigator is visible it is not using boost module so it s not important here i can reproduce this issue even with navigator removed i am having troubles reproducing it in fiddler but still not giving up i can t reproduce the case in gif that happened when i zoomed out i will cut this part out

we have requirements to have fixed height and width of a single element and align the chart on the bottom left corner in our case we potentialy have max 50 rows and if there are less than we calculate margin the chart is drawn correctly but print is failed in case we have 1 to 5 rows

kacper madej kacpermadej you make a valid point i wasn t comparing apples to applies i modified my example and found that when navigator is set to select full range disabling data grouping datagrouping on the main chart has approximately the same impact as disabling data grouping datagrouping on the navigator https jsfiddle net sk uy 1 36sk9uy1 see console output the reason i didn t notice that disabling data grouping datagrouping had the same performance impact on a main chart as on the navigator was that when i applied it to main charts i was able to compensate for the performance hit by turning on the boost module i have several charts with no navigator the same height and width as a navigator showing the full range of their data k 10k data points with data grouping datagrouping disabled and boost module on for clarity i m making an ecg viewer with large chart no navigator range of 10 seconds of heartbeat visible scrollbar for scrolling through 1 minute zoomed out view of heartbeat range min 2min to min 1min data grouping datagrouping disabled boost on zoomed out view min 1min to min 0min data grouping datagrouping disabled boost on hidden chart with navigator showing min 0min to min 1min with selected range of s 10s and event handling to update large chart with range selected here zoomed out view min 1min to min 2min data grouping datagrouping disabled boost on zoomed out view min 2min to min 3min data grouping datagrouping disabled boost on however the boost module seems to have no effect in speeding up rendering of just the navigator perhaps that s really the issue for me boost has no noticeable effect at improving rendering of navigator after data grouping datagrouping is disabled

we can we used different name already with transient setter getter for back compatibility which works fine i created this issue because this was allowed in previous grails 242 maybe this should be stated in upgrade guide also error message in test is not clear let me know if i can help further or just close it thanks

i come from a lamp stack background and am fairly new to groovy grails servlets web logic weblogic so i apologize if i am misinformed here or don t totally understand what is going on i am having difficulty finding the stack trace i can t seem to find any stacktrace log or see any in the stdout like i do with j boss jboss or tomcat when there is an error the only information i can find is the server logs for the deployment  and in the access logs i see a report of a 403 error without any more information i am thinking that this 403 is returned by the server and not the applciation because the servlet is not initializing and the server thinks that i am trying to browse the file structure if i change the settings to allow browsing the file structure i no longer get a 403 and instead see all the files from the war at this point i d cry if i saw any sign of life from this application even if it were just a stack trace from an error i have successfully deployed an example war provided by oracle that i can visit and use in my browser on this server but it seems to be built using an earlier servlet specification and includes a web xml file i have also created two other blank grails apps using 3014 as well as 311 and both of them behave the same as my current app they deploy and have a status of active but when i visit the url i get a 403 i will keep researching and trying to find a stack trace but any assistance with debugging techniques would be greatly appreciated i truly appreciate your time and effort in helping me look into this

yes the same thing happens the id must exist and its value must not be null for it to work if the object is embedded proof of this is that the main object that contains the embedded ruta has a null id and it manages to reach the rest endpoint

m and n are non negative integers should i have made that more explicit they were declared to be such when i ran the computation it s a finite sum if a convergence condition is returned then something has gone wrong the second sum is x y n but it is expressed in the form 1 t n if meijer g is causing problems then should the code be changed so that gosper is tried first

thanks for checking this submission i verified i could copy source code from the preview version into a source file and execute it correctly apparently you retrieved the source code by getting into edit mode in my original entry thanks for the backticks suggestion i ve now edited my original version as suggested the didn t get copied into my windows source file but the program ran anyway i m in a steep learning curve at the moment 
same result though i don t really think that should be a problem since x could certainly be imaginary in that case 
the characters are the values of the coefficients of the dirichlet series expansions of the respective l functions l chi s  sum n 0 chi n n s the characters are functions of integers n but the l functions are complex domain complex value s like zeta s  sum n 0 n s sympy has zeta for symbolic manipulation but provides dirichlet l functions only numerically through mpmath https github com sympy sympy blob master sympy functions special zeta functions py l 308 l308
in sage you can create a polynomial ring polynomialring object and use the corresponding variables to build matrices both implicilly as well as explicitly by specifying the base ring 
i agree i m actually super perturbed when a lambdified expression results in a sympy expression rather than some numeric answer if sympy was removed from the defaults this wouldn t happen it would be a breaking change but i doubt anyone uses lambdify to manipulate expressions both it s docstring and the prose docs discuss only numeric cababilities asmeurer what are your thoughts on this if this turns into a lengthy discussion i ll revert my change in the pr and add this later perhaps that would be best anyway this does make the deprecation slightly easier to deal with though so i d prefer this solution 
that s a nice thing to think about i ll read about it and post my thoughts here if i ll have something productive 
your patch passed the travis build are we supposed to close the issue only after the patch gets merged

my mistake i assumed sympy gamma had the latest installation of sympy turns out it s using a version from april of last year http gamma sympy org input i solve e 281e x 32x 29
true but still 
cython 022 and sympy 076 both installed using pip with the user option os is bullx 62 i will try it at home later as well later tonight edit i should add that theano function also works there is no particular reason why i want to use cython but i just saw it during testing 
this is embarrassing i should have investigated more this is not just happening with sym py sympy but with any matplotlib plot i note that if i start the repl with ipython gui qt everything runs great i ve changed my profile to set i apologize for wasting people s time i should have been able to figure this out myself or at least not have blamed it on sym py sympy 
here are my thoughts on this topic moorepants if this is indeed a c compiler limitation it is surprising that gcc didn t issue an error or at least a warning when it encountered a function with too many arguments note that i have verbose true in the code example above so i can confirm that gcc did not issue any such error or warning moorepants i m fine with my generated code abiding by the rules of c but if i was actually writing the c code myself and i needed to pass in more than 32 arguments i would wrap those arguments into some kind of struct there is no interface to do anything like that in sympy so i am left with this severe limitation my intuition is that it should always be possible to generate code that lumps all arguments into a struct passes in the struct and then retrieves the arguments from the struct inside the function into local variables before doing anything else these local variables would have the exact same scope as the function s arguments my intuition is that this approach could be implemented in a way that doesn t interfere with the rest of num py numpy s ufunc machinery although maybe i m missing something asmeurer my feeling is yes the code generator ought to work around this somehow defining a struct whose members match the argument list for some to be autogenerated function filling in the struct passing the in the struct instead of the long argument list and then retrieving the arguments out of the struct into local variables seems like a reasonable approach to me in the meantime i ll try working around this issue either by hacking in a compiler flag or setting an environment variable that being said i consider this approach to be suboptimal although 127 arguments would be enough for me i think it would be better if sympy natively supported an arbitrary number of arguments 
when i print sympy version i get 10 as output 
i had to add a a term to my u ind since i couldn t generate a list of velocity constraints without a coordinate st 1st derivative this was the obvious thing to do in retrospect and so the failure to run the linearisation is a good sanity check i m closing the issue thanks 
mine veersion of sympy is dev 077dev with python 276 python276 giving different error when using the installed sympy  the error above mentioned is the one i got when used the cloned sympy and this is the error when i used the sympy i installed via sudo apt get 
hi mm i prefer talk as a user i have some tchnical knowledge but don t is enough so i ll replace the explanation with my little experience i use sympy thx to the pkg symbolic of octave to realize the symbolics calcs in this case i found a way to optimize the product of matrix in octave using cuda https stackoverflow com questions converting 17493270converting octave to use cublas so i think if its posible optimize in that way the sympy functions too it can be very helpful then i m here cya d
d thx posting here for the record 
yep can t replicate in dev i was using the latest version via pip install ing will close sorry thanks 
first had to edit the original post in its simplest form  gives arg exp i w but just w should do it 
because in 1 from sympy import in 2 x symbol x real true in 3 a tan x cot x in 4 a is constant out 4 true in 5 simplify a out 5 1 in 6 a subs x 0 out 6 nan domain of a isn t s reals
kritkaran 94 kritkaran94 you can look into pretty printing module and figure out how to print singularity functions in the case of use unicode false 
i would think it should be something like this it can be hard to read if you have huge expressions and tiny brackets i feel like the brackets should be the same height as the expressions it looks better than the one with tiny brackets 
that already works and and has nothing to do with sym py sympy or i fail to see what the connection should be as it only uses plain python it yields which is the same result as for 1230 because thats how the multiplication of iterables and integers works in python 
what i put in i e x oo simplify x oo i can still substitute x with a non negative value other than one so its not clear that the result is nan right now we have 
arif ahmed 1995 arifahmed1995 does fixing it in mpmath fixes it in sympy 
i think one would expect the output to be similar to the following except for the expression returned by cse being a matrix where the individual elements are terms as defined by matrix multiplication that is unchanged by cse 
satya prakash dwibedi satyaprakashdwibedi yes both of the two math expressions that you gave should be s 1s vedarth n 2 is incorrect e is an identity matrix the total sum should be the same as the number of diagonal elements which is n 
gladly with the caveat that i m quite new to programming in general and sympy python specifically so i might have no idea what i m doing with matrix 
for me using pypy instead of python fixed it 
no don t put try except block this needs further investigation why does the test want a f inite field finitefield of nonprime order what does it expect to do with it 
yes you can 
indeed i tested in the branch of 14158 and got correct result false instead of the this error 
no idea for now i have not dug into it 
returns installed using macports 
basically yes but not necessarily imagine i have a set of some elements that cannot be expressed one by means of others atm i can t invent any concrete example when they do not form some vector space then i want to know if some other formal combinations of elements can be represented via this set that is actually representation in a basis now solvers make a logical assumption that a and b can be in some way connected e g a b tau 0 tau0 for linearly independent elements this is by definition impossible i see two possibilities here 1 an assumption say lindep false that prohibits non additive combinations a b a b a b etc with other linearly independent symbols which doesn t seem to have many applications in general 2 some general function that given an arbitrary basis and an element represents a function in that basis if i m correct something similar is implemented in quantum and polynomial modules 
i wrote a convenience wrapper for sympify for the users of my library that accepts something like a i here is the shortened code 
my apologies i was integrating with respect to z from 0 to a symbolic variable b this was then going to be replaced with a couple of different values specifically 10 100 and 1000
i can t see an automatic way to handle ambiguity but could suggest either that an option is provided to parse latex to switch on off the implicit multiplication or that a list of reserved words is provided to parse latex as an optional argument such that this list of words are not expanded as part of the implicit multiplication a combination of both of these strategies would hopefully catch all circumstances 
yes that is working in this case i ll just change the test which i mentioned above 
they form the domain set of distribution and used to derive expectation variance ie use for integration or summation oscarbenjamin do you it would be good idea to look into it 
don t know i have added pycosat in the dependency matrix for asv but still it failed

i have an ati with asus eah 4350 eah4350 chipset running on xp cheap but works great with games like hl 2 hl2 at full specs and all the testing is done in the latest chrome dev i rarely user firefox now but i ve just seen that on the latest ff b 7 ff40b7 the lights pointlights gl demo works fine on the other side the spheres i was moving around with fox and textures on ff they are completely black can see them because the backgound is dark blue you can take a look here if you wish http www omiod com test game fk htm fk2htm i used webglrenderer sandbox webglrenderer2sandbox html as starting path and now i see that it is very choppy and lacks textures in ff while in chrome it is nice and smooth 
i mean i couldn t modify it right because i don t know the right way i have a plane in my scene and i want when i click in a point on the plane at that position to create an object let s say a box and then i want to be able when i click at the box to select it the dimensions of the renderer that i use is 1300 x 700 it s not window inner width innerwidth window inner height innerheight can you please point me how this can be done 
ok it is a front camera and i want to make it a perspective camera how will i rotate the x vector of the camera 
i can try to update it i m happy to take your suggestions patches some comments before you do the only reason people should arrive at that page is because web gl webgl is not running for them so there is not much reason to put a fancy demo there are versions with a spinning web gl webgl logo instead of the green square but another issue is keeping it small because again basically only people that can not see web gl webgl will arrive there so for example at first someone sent in a meg 4meg demo with a spinning web gl webgl logo then another that came in at k 400k currently it s just planned to have a spinning cube with a web gl webgl texture on it keeping it fast and simple so the user can get back to whatever they really wanted to do in the first place so  it mostly needs better page design less d 3d as for the troubleshooting page maybe i should just make it redirect to the link it provides rather than display it thoughts 
that a cool option too but there s still the question of why always attach to window if you attach to scope dom element domelement instead then users can work around the rest and it seems like you get the same behavior as your currently getting but still let users work around the issues
hi chandler i realized the flaw of my method it is a recursive pipeline where lo d lod chunks are organized in a quadtree and selected based on view distance by managing the visible attribute it also meant making sure everything starts at invisible and only the relevant chunks are marked to rendering this first step to mark everything as invisible meant traversing the entire quadtree to reset the attributes i ve hacked my way into the immediate rendering pass so each object is rendered as needed without the need to maintain these flags providing the speed boost i was looking for do you perform any sort of out of core rendering for your terrain engine where you only maintain a subset of your tiles on the gpu 
i ve sorted that out thank you its just box collider boxcollider mesh property is added dynamically in another place and initially is not a member of box collider boxcollider object 
thanks hayfield subdividing the plane solved this and was far less expensive than my earlier attempts to make 400 little plane tiles mrdoob it would be great to be able to put a value of something like z order zorder that when set will always be drawn before or after something else for instance if i set something like this board z order zorder 1 this cursor z order zorder 2 then regardless it will draw all of the z order zorder number 1 items first then all of the number 2 items etc forcing the board to be below any content again thanks for this hopefully i ll have something worthy of showing off in a couple of months 
yes i set tried to set this in constructor set this dynamically  one result nothing 
no i can t it s part of big project that you and others can see soon i mean imagine you move mouse up and your camera moves up when it reaches 90 degrees it rotates now we look back but when you again move mouse up your camera moving down and when moving mouse down your camera moving up it means y axis inverted 
well i found my way out of it i didn t know that when you create a face the given arguments are the number of the vertex i was giving the vertex itself as the argument and that was creating the error thanks for answering so fast i am eager to learn three and collaborate with you misandov

hi mr doob sorry for late reply but i had to step off threejs for a bit yes you are correct in most circumstances for objects in d 3d space but i am simply rendering walls so it is assumed that all the walls are perpendicular to the ground so they can be represented as lines in this context with their surface parallel to the floor each floor has a fixed height applied to all walls each wall then is to be displayed as a plane this is not ideal in the long run but it is currently the way we are mapping information from d 2d cad our current java open gl opengl software already displays like this and i was hoping to do a simple mapping to web gl webgl we got an example up and running using triangle polygons in web gl webgl but there were issues with the normals and then when we tried to incorporate fonts into the rendering we realised we needed more powerful libraries and threejs looks like the best bet out there at the moment with a good collection of nice examples ideally we would like to be rendering d 3d building information models bim in web gl webgl with import functionality for tools like google sketch up sketchup that way we can use surface models for certain types of views but also have a more hardy underlying solid model like ifc to incorporate more domain specific data about a building for things like simulation so this is where we are starting and all help is very very much appreciated kris 
hi mrdoob this works better but i think this is still not a orthographic projection same as general open gl opengl theory for following code it works the fifth parameter still have a range requirement if i change it to 1 it will not display also the z position of the camera affects the result if i change to 10000 it will not display in theory the z position of camera will not affect the result of orthographic projection  by the way i am a fresh man of d 3d graphics i am not sure about this you can try to update these parameters to analyze whether it is a bug or my understanding issue this is not so urgent for me since i am just learning three js threejs i can skip it to continue and maybe orthographic projection is really not so generally used but if you have time you can try to look into it to see whether it is a issue to make three js threejs more perfect sorry for my poor english thanks shenghong

hi mrdoob can i zip its contents and send it in an email i won t be able to make the link public because its on an internal server and currently i m just working of my desktop 
thank both of you very much for the quick reply i really appreciate your awesome work zz 85 zz85 just regarding your code your answer seems very logical  i created a very short example to test it but it fails  so get point getpoint works and the get tangent gettangent method exists but runs into an error i was using r 45 r45 do i need a more recent version of three js if there is one or will the code need to be fixed  kind regards and thank you again 
thanks very much sorry i do not know how to link with the my page i will see whether i can send the folder 
i gave it a shot the newer dev version has the same issue as the one i was previously using 
humm i don t know if i can do that it s a building s final modeling i will ask the permission to the liable company  but seeing the code i think the shader var isn t mandatory right what i did here for testing was just add an if to the code on line 621 as below  the load code run with no errors i ll try to render now to see if will work 
well i have simplified the model because our customer doesn t allow us to share it here you have the url http www megaupload com d n uj w 5 n7uj84w5 although i m on vacation time for a week i ve done some kind of research by opening two models of rims and found that rim that loses spokes spokes are done only by one single edge each rim that doesn t lose spokes spokers are done by one cylinder each doesn t matter if you use three js exporter on blender or the convert obj three py script the spokes disappear too thx 
my mac os version is x 106x i tried in all browsers from chrome x 15x safari x 5x to firefox x 8x but it s always hang or very slow when open the example if i install safari x 5x in window 7 it works fine so i think this is mac os problem 
i just had to use perspective camera and raise the far value
what kind of collisions there are i want to check the collision of the camera vs any of the objects in the scene so instead the cube in the example i consider the camera as a cube and check if any of the sides collide vs any object in the scene so if i want the character to be of 100 width and i walk on the front i would check the left and right side of the camera what would be camera position x 50 and camera position x 50
sorry here is the code for it it worked on the orbit lines that are circle like so i thought i will work here too
i meant i will put this file to the package https github com mrdoob three js blob master license as the license of three js which is i should do because of the license itself the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software 
ahh i figured it out that is used for repeating textures i had a stone texture that was repeated along the face of the wall over and over i think that s what v 0v values outside of 01 mean no update was required on the python convertor all i had to do was add some values to my texture  i found this on another post but i ll put it here for any future visitor with this same question 
no below is the source thanks 
sure should not be a problem since i have already implementing this stuff in open gl opengl c in my open source project open cloth opencloth http code google com p opencloth so it s just a matter of translation of code from c to javascript 
source is both your dev and r 47 r47 version client browser all safari chrome firefox opera 12 and ie 9 ie9 canvasrender server works over mac osx 1068 and fails over iis 7 iis7 over windows 7 and over windows server 2008 r 2 r2 how can i check what is happenning probably some differences on 
i needed to tweak three material parameters instead of creating a new material like this 
i have a bunch of materials each one has a pair of shaders with various features that i want to enable disable occasionally i don t want to do the feature enabling at runtime with uniforms it would be too slow every material in the scene to be executing unused code in the gpu however i do want to be able to pick on a per mesh basis a shader pair with a certain feature enabled when necessary this is a pretty common thing to do in game programming i d rather have all the shader compilation done upfront or at least be cached so as to reduce the overhead of effect transitions so is there any efficient way to do this 
thank you you guys are great the code in dev branch resolved my problem just for reference here s a code demonstrating the original problem click a couple of times on y or y buttons http www wingooli com homam three js tests rotation rotation original htm and here s the same code using the dev build http www wingooli com homam three js tests rotation rotation dev htm
the issue with the z order if that s the correct term appears in all browsers but in safari the texture seems to be corrupted too here is a screenshot showing both renderers http www phunkei de canvas issue jpg
the ability to add target is it there in directional light or anything other light 
i m sorry but i can t show more than this partial screenshot with a red background to see the holes http i servimg i40servimg com u f screen jpg f4013208997screen10jpg these holes are not always visible depending on the camera distance angle the camer target is x 538711 y 5742553 when i move near the world origin there is no issue nb i didn t change the webgl renderer precision still highp 
zz 85 zz85 that s a really good point i m not sure whether my version is doing too much magic read it s abstracted too much away from the end user mrdoob s version is nice clean and minimal and maybe that s what s actually needed personally i prefer my implementation but that s only because that s the way i like to work put the complications behind the scenes and have a hopefully simple api to use instead if i weren t me though and i came across my version i daresay i wouldn t actually learn what is going on behind the scenes because i simply wouldn t have to care about it and that might be a problem the most pertinent question is what the majority of three js users preferred working style is 
sure i ll give it a shot got my hands a bit full converting from geometry buffer geometry buffergeometry but would make a nice break 
i like that sphere controls spherecontrols zooms on mouse wheel events but the trackball controls trackballcontrols rotation feels more intuitive for example i don t fully grasp why the y axis flips in this example using sphere controls spherecontrols  http jsfiddle net jcarlile nrt cp nrtcp what i ultimately want to do is create sketch up sketchup like camera controls that allow zooming dragging and orbiting around a scene i was thinking i would start with a camera that could move around a hemisphere always looking at the origin and never goes below the ground plane and control the radius of the hemisphere via the mouse wheel would you suggest that trackball controls trackballcontrols is the right way to go about this 
gero 3 gero3 update the world matrix worldmatrix i don t know how to do that can you give me an example i think maybe this can solve the problem
yes i m exporting them from maya 2011 with default settings tried it with a simple primitive sphere and a unwrapped and fully textured model with more complex geometry result is the same 
you are a legend thanks worked perfect
this is my code thanks 
ahhh i see what you mean a separate vertex and fragment shader with code from web gl shaders webglshaders js in my first post i used the original code from the example  the fragment shader fragmentshader is nonsense i have no idea for the correct code it s more a quiz for me 
here is a screenshot http dl dropbox com u screen 563937screen shot 20shot at 202012052320at ce 2012051920ce bc ce bc png as you can see i have many issues the most important is the texture coordinates the flags you see in the back have baked texture i use cinema d cinema4d so they apear correctly i was about to bake all the surfaces in my scene but i haven t done it yet another important issue is that the faces are not double sided doublesided so they are visible from one side only the easy solution for me for this would be to dublicate the surfaces and reverse the direction but this will make my file much bigger s 
i can try to create a jsfiddle to show the problem by tomorrow but it s probably my lack of knowledge of the repository as well ass euler angles that slows me down if you had three sets of coordinates and three sets of angles in space where the second set is relative to the first and the third set is relative to the second how would you do these transformations with euler order eulerorder zyx if i ve understood correctely geometry position x value  positions the geometry relative to the global coord system geometry translate x translatex value  positions the geometry relative to the local coord system is there a similar technique for rotations 
no it s dynamically generated throughout the duration of the piece 
i used the console logging in webgl camera html and confirmed that the keycodes are as expected ascii character are mainly unchanged in european keyboards same problem with that programm cannot use o and p always opens search i also tested with all add ons disabled firexfox 120 confirmed on two other computers 32 bit and 64 bit 
done https github com mrdoob three js pull 2051
i used a model named seymour anim dae anim2dae from http collada org owl browse php sess parent 0parent expand 131expand order 0order name curview 0 it should have a skeletal animation that makes the model jump in the air and move its joints but i have not succeeded animating the model with three js 
why do the extra math sqrt as far as i can tell it s completely unnecessary 
it s a laptop dell inspiron r 15r with dual video card ge force geforce gt m 525m force ware forceware 26830 and intel hd graphics 3000 815102361 i tried to force chrome to use either of the cards but nothing changes anything else you want to know i take it that the example program behaves correctly on your machine it is really bizarre because other geometry renders just fine i thought the particles are not different than other polygons in the scene apart from maybe using a different shader 
right morph loop is more informative than morph clamped loop clampedloop actually there s now two kinds of information about the animation 1 which direction it is playing 2 what happens when the animation finishes the second point can with this suggestion take on three values a stop the animation b start it again from the beginning or c reverse the direction and continue playing this can be either implemented with the two flags morph loop and morph mirrored loop mirroredloop or with one variable that holds one of the three enumeration values a b or c first i thought using the enumeration would be the more correct solution but i am not javascript expert and it would probably break the existing api so i ll leave that to you 
http jsfiddle net wsg w wsg7w 3 note i didn t add the font java script javascript file because the code breaks before it s needed 
sure as long as someone double checks i don t comment anything wrong i ll close this since i m doing it 
because i didn t find any other way to change size of mesh or geometry during animation process i used tween and scale to disappear mesh gradually new tween tween mesh scale to y time 0time easing tween easing quadratic ease in out easeinout start

yes i m actually using three dart i ll first make changes in dart and after make them to three js the idea is to not use steps blindly but with some heuristic on straight line d line3d always have just 1 set for curved lines spline closedspline etc use the step number for composed curves curvepath multiply the steps by the number of curved lines and add 1 for every straight line this will make it necessary to have specific u array with all the steps as they will not be uniform especially to create the frenet frames frenetframes an option would be for the step argument also be able to receive an array with u s so we can know them in advance and be able to create our own frenet frames as we go into the future may change from step to angle tolerant what do you think 
after digging through the bulk of threejs code i doubt that it would have much impact on performance it would certainly help in transforming normals tangents and binormals which should be manipulated not by the direct matrices but by their inverse transpose matrices important when generating worldspace based nbt frames mixing normals etc

yep thanks have issued a pull request 
i think that specifying those options in the parameter list should assign them appropriately in the constructor i don t see the use case for auto clear autoclear and it s brethren web gl renderer webglrenderer render should clear by default and an optional parameter should disable clearing for that draw how it is now when is auto clear autoclear necessary all it does is override the user s own parameter of false to the render function now case 1 i want to clear each frame  call render without specifying clear parameter case 2 i want to clear some frames  disable auto clear autoclear and specify clear parameter after removing auto clear autoclear case 1 i want to clear each frame  call render without specifying clear parameter case 2 i want to clear some frames  disable auto clear autoclear and specify clear parameter as you can see the auto clear autoclear flag is just plain useless now the only thing it adds is the undesirable situation where you specify to not clear in the render function and auto clear autoclear overrides that why wouldn t you want to allow specification of those options in the constructor in general with javascript i think its not the greatest idea to encourage mutating instance variables without a method in a library that doesn t really distinguish private and public variables say i mutated renderer antialias after the constructor was run expecting it to behave appropriately because i can t be sure any data members of a class are going to have an effect i think it s desirable to either prefix each member p for private ro for read only or to only allow mutation through function method calls

minified version of the three js always prints the version of the renderer being used three web gl renderer webglrenderer 58 i consider this debug and i think minified versions are used in webpage releases if i want to debug my webpage i just use the non minified version 
in my view the goal would be to import the lines color too it doesn t currently so i suppose i should have make a objmtl lines loader objmtllinesloader that allow to do this i don t know if it s relevant to add lines support in obj mlt loader may be with an option since it is not the same type of geometry and material what sould i do to contribute the house example i m a beginner with github too 
mrdoob sorry my comment about the enhancement was due to me forgetting to select a label i would have called it a bug since there is a clone method on the scene but it doesn t produce the expected results like gaitat said 
oh doing it from scratch worked and finally pointed me into my own material overwrite in a different location sorry consider this solved

ok here is a loadable threejs scene http snk to f cdhjeccd and here a blender file describing the scene http snk to f cdu ykk 7 cdu9ykk7 one of the walls has a pinboard i would expect this to have a darkly colored frame while the center should use a corklike texture it renders fine in blender but not in webgl threejs where the center is just plain white i ve been experimenting with different settings to get textures onto meshes if there is a certain way this should be done maybe a pointer to respective documentation would help generally i feel that lights and materials are a big subject with any amount of gotchas and some directions would be good the patch i am working on also needs documentation it is unfortunately not obvious what threejs does or can do with lights that are exported from blender 
sure compare where flickering occurs and mesh frustum culled frustumculled is not altered to where mesh frustum culled frustumculled is set to false for all planes before rendering also those particles floating around are just textures on planes if they are set to appear within the frustum and never outside of it the flickering during that part doesn t occur even if they wander outside of it after creation it seems to me to be caused when they are created then added to the scene while outside the frustum and hence immediately culled it s like the error only occurs if you try to manipulate it in this case the position by tweening before it enters the frustum but this functionality is somewhat desired if you want to move something from initially off the screen to on the screen 
http shine glowanalytics com stealth model 1model room console room7console 1 the console shows number of intersections detected by the raycaster js which includes the ray casting http goo gl d nzzj 7 dnzzj7 js which loads the files http goo gl li kb jb likbjb intermediate ds 3ds file http goo gl vjip 87 vjip87 sketchup file http goo gl tmqd x 1tmqdx i have also tried using the collada loader but that loads objects as d objects 3dobjects rather than a mesh i am not keen on modifying the raycaster to support d objects 3dobjects i have done a number of experiments and i cannot figure out what causes some objects to have their intersections detectable and others to not be i created a fresh model in sketchup and exported it nothing within that model is collidable change the model url param to test 
yeah sure here it is http jsfiddle net u tsed utsed 5 you should see 5 geometries in the console i believe geometry groups aren t properly freed since deallocate geometry deallocategeometry in web gl renderer webglrenderer iterates over geometry groups without calling gl delete buffer deletebuffer on vertex buffer normal buffer etc see the deallocation 
yes i m using two renderers because i need two scenes in my application the second is some sort of picture in picture which shows an overview over all objects in the main scene so i have to clone everything and i had troubles while cloning my particle system particlesystem like i said the problem is the texture which is only referenced in my opinion a clone method produces a complete new object without any references so i would call this issue a bug of course i can fix this in my own application by cloning the texture manually but i wanted to point this out for everyone to think about it perhaps you agree with my definition of a clone method 
i use the convert to threejs py which is put at utils converters fbx

as i said i m not sure it s a three js bug 1 run misc controls pointerlock html example 2 click to enter the lock mode everything works 3 hit escape key to unlock 4 click again to enter the lock now pointer is locked but mouse movement doesn t rotate camera 
tbh there are older bugs than this it is not big deal to fix though you could just put something like etc so that things like object loader objectloader would not break or you could fix it there as well 
unfortunately this file is 100 mb and has k 20k objects so not simple at all 
since i didn t know when someone will have time to implement it i used quick hack  not sure if it s useful to anyone

yes a three web gl texture webgltexture would be great but is not as easy as i thought there are some issues when using this approach while another three geometry is at the viewport the webgl texture webgltexture seems like removed from the material i think this should be because the texture slot of the web gl texture webgltexture is static and the engine doesn t know nothing about it so probably is overriding it i still looking for a good approach to solve this and being able to use our gpu stuff within three js without issues

so in my real app i m using sprites for text labels i use dom canvas objects to draw the text and use that text as a texture which is then applied to a plane the shader then controls various aspects such size visibility etc the texts labels get updated based on what the user is seeing there could be thousands of labels on screen at any given time thus there s a lot of destruction and creation of dynamic labels i noticed that a lot of memory was being used and eventually the tab died i narrowed down the problem to the labels to better isolate the issue i made a j sfiddle jsfiddle that mimics what happens in the real world scenario but speeds it up from hours into minutes i based my js fiddle jsfiddle on the threejs own memory example https threejs org examples webgl test memory the fiddle dies just like my app after a while something is for sure killing it i m here to get some help from someone who knows more about three js and web gl webgl than me i ve not been the first one to find peculiar memory behaviours when using sprites as textures https github com mrdoob three js issues 7449 what do you think is wrong with my test i ve also created a fiddle that uses a power of two texture it takes longer for the tab to die but still does so https jsfiddle net e a atsh e3a8atsh 1

ps i have included a console log right after the init function which writes ltc 1 and 2 into the shaderlib both ltc 1 and 2 are undefined because three shaderlib and three module shaderlib are two separate modules i think this is actually worse i hope i m wrong but i believe that any project right now that relies on examples jsm pulls two full threejs bundles it works if you do  but that s no solution because 100 of all three extension in the eco system pull from three

many monthes ago when groups was added to library i ve found answer on so like that https stackoverflow com a 497089154640932 in my app i have 2 meshes on the same position 1 for normal objects 2 for selected objects and when i need select some object s i ve exclude from render by groups some part of normal geometry and include some part of selected geometry but when no selected objects i must show all geometry from first mesh and i use group from start to infinity btw similar behaviour used in draw range drawrange https threejs org docs api core buffer geometry buffergeometry draw range drawrange if infinity is a problem ok i will change my behaviour to real count but it require more operations for calculate actual length
will do 1
sorry it s a huge non isolated pile of code i just bypassed it and i ll move on to something else and while googling for this problem i actually found that i should have used another part of the api the drawcalls here is the removal commit as the head of the trail https github com nraynaud webgcode commit f af c a cc fbef d d caf f c 0 3f8463af8c4a7cc87fbef37d9d728caf6656f7c0 when increasing the size of an indexed buffered geometry bufferedgeometry representing a polyline the error would pop when checking in js all the indices in the index buffer were smaller than the position buffer length ie i had no overflow as if the new index buffer was uploaded and the object rendered before the new position buffer was uploaded you are welcome to close if you don t want to dig into my code 
it works with r dev r74dev 
i use this attribute to apply the same texture on adjacent objects i do not know if it s the best approach

actually this is more pervasive than i initially thought it happens on more than nexus there is a fiddle here antialias false https jsfiddle net s ha hq 3s7ha8hq 5 antialias true https jsfiddle net s ha hq 3s7ha8hq 4 the green area should start fading to white from very near the camera plane the fog effect gets pushed way back when antialias true this happens on the following devices i tested on  nexus 7 2013 marshmallow adreno 320 gpu  sony xperia m 2 m2 lollipop adreno 305 gpu  motorola moto e g 4g nd 2nd generation lollipop adreno 306 gpu this device works fine huawei honor x 4x kit kat kitkat arm mali mp 4 450mp4 gpu 
is there nobody else with this same problem 
edit once i applied loc rot scale exported as geometry instead of buffergeom things started to work somewhat better see edit 2 in the editor for the test scene although the floor plane was invisible with skinning enabled on it and the animated objects seem to be in the correct place i need to make two materials it seems because skinning is not liked when there are no bones attached to the objects using the materials i may end up uploading the original scene i m having troubles with to see if anyone can help me figure out what i m doing wrong edit 2 i forgot applying location puts the origin to the center of the scene so once i selected everything put origin to center of mass control alt shift c with everything selected the animated objects again move to near origin and there s some nifty screen tearing going on as well https github com mrdoob three js files multi 1027677multi armature test scene zip this is hopefully the new test files if i didn t screw up uploading somehow edit apologies for the delay in response this is a small scene with a single material and texture with a few primitives two armatures two rest poses and two animations embedded along with the json output from io three removed old file i think it s got flipped normals on floor but that s my fault for sure i didn t spend much time making it but it sure highlights this issue i think when loading it into the three editor test screen shot https cloud githubusercontent com assets fc ec c 76805264308358fc7ec1c ad 40ad e af 11e785af f b e e png 4f80b535e6e4png 
i m afraid it s not a very compelling one i was hunting for a way to easily merge indexed buffer geometry buffergeometry objects together and was testing if i could merge them as regular geometry objects as a first approach the merge worked fine but all the materials were set to the first material in the multi material multimaterial for the mesh i subsequently created the geometries in question use multi material multimaterial

im trying to load texture map it on a plane in the texture s original size and leave the rest of the plane in white color so i use this   thats a little complicated but do the job for small planes when i tried this on big size 1000 1000 plane the editor crashed 
in the nrrd file you have two parts a header with information about the type and size of the data and then the data the data are the values of all the voxels in a parallelepiped whose size is given in a header i believe we can return a typed array with all the values and a header object from this volume of data the user can easily extract slices in any of the three perpendicular directions if you rotate the xtk demo after turning on volume rendering you will see that the direction of the plans is changing according to the camera marching cube can be used to extract a mesh but i work in the medical field and most of the time we just want to display the three perpendicular slices like in the xtk demo when you turn off volume rendering le 1 mars 2016 1121 am mr doob notifications github com a crit

haven t fiddled in ages will try but you can look at those two lines and it s pretty straight forward 
everything linux mint 173 repositories can provide as i ve mentioned it was running fine on firefox last month it runs fine in chromium now what am i concerned is i don t know how many of low budget users has the same problem

mrdoob like you did i observed running your example and mine in firefox did not produce a memory leak it also appears there have been other issues reported of memory leaks in chrome s gpu process which leads me to believe i found another instance of this so i filed a new issue with chromium here https bugs chromium org p chromium issues detail id 634012 mrdumb thanks for posting your example i didn t see a looping video inside unless one manually replays the katy perry video which makes it difficult to use as a test case nice example though

thanks for your reply i hava sent you an e mail with the fbx file xd
jostschmithals my gosh you re right i forgot that i had exported and perhaps manually edited the json file a long time ago it used to include the following syntax position type float array float32array array 0 30 29 item size itemsize 90048 i re exported using the latest blender exporter and i got position type float array float32array array 0 30 29 item size itemsize 3 so yes you re right to calculate the array length i should ve been using geometry count 2 instead of geometry item size itemsize 2 i m guessing r 83 r83 used to be more forgiving glad to admit that it was an oversight on my part 
mugen 87 mugen87 sure i could probably tackle this next week

ah because i don t know any better makes sense now you point it out but it s not obvious from a user s perspective and it s not mentioned in the documentation for material and a lot of examples contain that line which i assumed was harmless perhaps it could handle this case a bit more gracefully either a warning or not randomly getting removed 
sounds very practical reference card are though very minimalist but would serve the purpose very well

1 yes i get the same output with r 90 r90 2 yes this example gets rendered correctly i am wondering why the viewer i created is not it worked fine until i updated the devices there is a spot light already added in the viewer also i have seen when i add light to the scene from browser console on i phone iphone some parts get lit up and some not at all 
looeee sorry for bothering i can t reproduce on latest dev also 
you mean with a pull request i can try to do that 
mugen 87 mugen87 i have looked into this but its unfortunately too massive to call live on a running 60 fps application i edited my post above in some occasions it can happen that i need to create 50 or more sprites in a single frame an rpg where a lot of damage numbers could pop up at any time or a zone with np cs npcs is loaded into the world and their name plates are created at the same time so working with a round robin system of cached html elements that get freed up every frame works but it still causes problems when materials are loaded that are not rendered instantly for example a sprite text spritetext that is invisible until later is there a way to at least force materials to update on the next render call even if they are set to visible false 
yes sure the title makes more sense like this i m gonna try to experiment with uniform caching this week i ll post the results here

wow missing that three module js was not my greatest achievement today it would help though if inside the documentation https threejs org docs manual en introduction import via modules the import statement would be changed accordingly or there was some sentence pointing to the existence of a special build for the use as a module i think otherwise other people could fall into the same trap as i did they might however notice the module file before opening a git issue 
thanks it did fix my issue although after loading exported model objects of type three group are now of type three object d object3d it makes no difference for me but could you please explain why it was done like this 
is there some solution for this problem this seems to be a little different from 15393

but it has loaded some gltf files with tga textures very well so i thought it would be a bug to be honest i used ds 3ds max babylon plugin to export the gltf file because the original ds 3ds max could not export gltf files and the babylon plugin has no such an export option to choose the type of the texture 
i investigated it further when i switched firefox version nothing changed didn t try to change mesa because this can get messy because of all the dependencies but with ubuntu 1843 live which has mesa 190 the problem also doesn t show up ubuntu 1910 and arch with mesa 192 both have it but it only shows up in firefox i ll report to mesa gitlab because while it only shows up in firefox it was caused by some change there edit here it is https gitlab freedesktop org mesa mesa issues 1991

yes i can work around the issue easily by just adding vertex colors to the meshes that currently lack them or i could add such code to the loader that it would assume default color for all vertices but this would bloat the file i will look into the other formats but i like the simplicity of specifying sharp smooth edges using per face vertex normals in obj

no it doesn t i have a several arduino versions folders installed one and few non admin has it influence i think it has because i see that there is ethernet version 110 in 166 library folder i think that gui reads config from an old 106 installed version folder users app data appdata local is there any possibility to change this behaviour 
when i close arduino and open it again everything is fine again i don t want to use line numbers greetz chris
hi paul thank you for answering i tried it with bot original and clone it was the same behavior i tried it on either ide 162 and 163 it was always the same later i will try to update the bootloader best regards franz am 04042015 1247 schrieb paul stoffregen

i noticed windows was running slowly and using a lot of memory so i checked task manager taskmanager i can see conhost starting and stopping continuously in the processes tab when i close the ide conhost stops trying to start and the pc goes back to normal so i m guessing the ide is triggering the effect one way or another many thanks for your interest martin
maybe an additional script for those who do have the privileges everything will continue to work the same way but those who wish can get a shortcut to dash also why isn t arduino package updated in the ubuntu repos 
how to reproduce 1 install arduino ide v 169 v169 2 install mkr 1000 mkr1000 board support from the boards manager 3 check that basics blink example compiles fine for mkr 1000 mkr1000 board 4 configure additional boards manager source https redbearlab github io arduino package redbear index json 5 install red bead redbead duo package the boards manager 6 basics blink example compilation fails for target mkr 1000 mkr1000 board 7 see in detailed compilation log that the wrong toolchain is selected 
matthijskooijman ffissore yes exactly i have specified a board structure and it is not avr so why is avr libraries included and yes i do have all necessary libs since it works just fine when i use the ide in gui mode and select the generic board for that architecture in the menu and compile then the correct libraries are referenced from the gui console  the esp 8266 esp8266 package is installed from here https github com esp arduino esp8266arduino however i have noticed something interesting when i have opened and compiled using the gui it suddenly works to compile from console with the same arguments that did not work before so the gui set some magical properties when executed that the console version inherits somehow 
that is a good question i don t know the answer i will need some more time to investigate this issue and possible solution i found out that compiler java contains code that writes that line into the ino i guess i could try to download arduino sources and modify that part and try something i m thinking to modify it so that it adds full path of ino into the cpp do you know if that is possible maybe that will help but i don t believe it is enough it might be hard to come up with proper solution without breaking existing functionality but let s see 
yes please 
yes apparently they have decided that unused bits would not be ignored replaced by s 0s anymore but use their actual value of 1 unprogrammed it makes more sense like that in my opinion are you sure about the difference between programmers it seems strange that a programmer would return s 0s for unused bits since the micro will i think always return s 1s this would mean that some programmers modify the values and replace the unused by 0 internally anyway i only have a usbasp to test so if you have other programmer model it would probably be good to test to be sure 
the is the best question there is a conflict between the amount of work required to implement and the amount of work for the users would be good to find a compromise somewhere in the middle the lib index code is all in one spot so the implementation on the side side should should spread around the leaves the user for every user happy with use latest unless i tell you there will be others that have a compelling reason to say it is not good for them i was thinking that something like the following heuristic would allow a gradual implementation over time global configurable ide setting multi lib version support  always latest always oldest  behavior modifiable per sketch via a general choice for this sketch inside the dependencies txt i proposed  then in a separate phase a per sketch config screen can be implemented either template validator as a tab the editor or right click in the outline view or popup inside the editor template validator basically means treating the file like a normal file like i currently do for the lib specific descriptors img width 1008 alt screen shot 20151102 at 1 26 08 pm src https cloud githubusercontent com assets fa dd e f bdb be f aa 1318077108817861fa83dd6816611e58f49bdb42be5f3aa png when i write separate phase it is just to show that these are tasks that allow a gradual delivery of the complete scheme rather than a all or nothing feature 
makelangelo firmware was already fixed when i reported the error add the keyword static to any method in the firmware and try to recompile

i used blink code from example
our system is set up that uses windows mandatory profiles and it uses environment variables rather than registry we cannot execute any program using the arduino ide for us to be able to use the arduino ide we need it to check environment variables first rather than the registry 
libraries installed using the library manager are still being installed to the libraries subfolder in the default sketchbook location

yes it happens after some minutes of editing code it happend mostly the whole time i re installed the ide with same effect am 01022016 um 0956 schrieb matthijs kooijman   gre lars
it should affect both avr and sam bug 4511 explains this issue in detail here s an example snippet  basically this should not happen when you re writing a c or c compliant program doing so is forbidden according to the standard so the compiler is free to assume that it will never happen when optimizing the code which happens with o 2 o2 or greater which is what arduino uses gcc provides a fwrapv option to override this behavior as i mentioned in issue 4511 and pr 4624 honestly i d prefer this bug to be fixed rather than documented but even if it gets fixed it might be important to document it in case someone s using an old version ps as i said i haven t physically tested this code snippet although i did back in the day and undefined behavior being undefined behavior it might be possible that it does something unexpected such as working 
hi i don t have an aggressive antivirus with regard to enforced protections is this system integrity protection thanks
dear martino thank you for your quick answer double clicking reset button did work the board shows in ide now sorry i must have missed that information when reading your getting started for the record though i include the screenshot from usb hardware tab best regards michal  do or do not there is no try yoda
the code isn t running in an isr it s just placed in init 0 init0 so that it s the first thing running after the bootloader which in this case is optiboot 62 the code is test reset ino from the optiboot project if compiled as is using arduino ide 1611 the function reset flags init resetflagsinit will not be linked into init 0 init0 so the reset cause will never be available in register r 2 r2 as provided by the bootloader you will always see a reset value of x 0 0x0 removing the currently commented dummy line which never executes because the reset flags will never be x ee 0xee forces the code to be linked and now you ll get reset value of x 8 0x8 which is correct wdt reset you get the same effect if you remove os optimization  here s the compilation output c program files arduino

hi cristian i m afraid i cannot reproduce the error it was detected during a course where the students were using mac os macos and windows 10 i only use linux and it works correcly regards el 021116 a las 1108 cristian maglie escribi 
i emailed my self a code i was working on so i could continue at home when i tried to open save the code from my email it wouldn t save or open i think it said it needed a specific file folder for it to be opened from or something along those lines i was wondering if there was already some solution to this problem or if a solution could be implemented into the next update for the arduino code editors 
wow i m super stupid i can t believe i didn t catch that at the same time tho i m a little confused about the decision to have stream inherit from print my understanding was that not everything that can be read can also be written to and not everything that can be written to can also be read like i stream istream and o stream ostream of std c 
i ve done that already and there is no extra output from the console it s like the debug program does not catch any errors or exceptions 
i used before version 180 with another boardsettings which use with portable folder but i have also a original one where i never touched this setting this comes to my mind as i unzipped the 181 version und applied the new board settings just copy from 180 on my first build of marlin many warnings come up then i opened the again the portable 180 and was still without these warnings so i am not sure what trigger that issue exactly

thanks for pointing to that thread sterretje however there is no solution yet turning off the one drive onedrive s files on demain is not a solution as older arduino versions still works with the option on subscribed to 6867 though 
martino thanks for getting back to me i just upgraded to sierra os 10126 and the problem disappeared dave on mon jan 8 2018 at 525 am martino facchin notifications github com wrote 
actually i didn t run install sh at all i just extracted the tar gz note there are no installation instructions whatsoever in the download page and noticed there was an executable called arduino so i launched it and it worked i do have processing 221 i m not sure i ever installed that one either so maybe at some point some association has been made between whatever binary is at the core of both and that icon in my opinion there must be something deeply wrong either in the way ubuntu manages applications or in some or both of these two particular applications for this to happen even assuming i did something wrong 
indeed don t see how i could do that i do not even manage to start the app using the start command at all this is why i hate windows store apps on a pc

thanks so much for this it never occurred to me that a sketch that compiles correctly might cause such issues i now know that i do indeed have sketches that do not exhibit this error all my sketches which cause deselection of the usb port turned out to be larger variants of the one i have uploaded by trial and error i have narrowed the problem down to the highlighted instruction of the audio frequency meter audiofrequencymeter library meter begin  the problem does not occur when this line is commented out my code is closely based on the example in the arduino documentation a simple frequency meter for arduino zero arduino cc en tutorial simple audio frequency meter simpleaudiofrequencymeter this published example uploads and executes on my same board successfully can you please help me understand why the identical command in my sketch is causing such problems problem sketch problemsketch txt https github com arduino arduino files problem sketch 2297641problemsketch txt

compiling for a arduino uno seems to be fine no errors had not test that before because i manly use esp 8266 esp8266 chips but for the esp 8266 esp8266 all functions declared in an other tab than the main program ino is undeclared main program tab  it seems to be related with the esp 8266 esp8266 25 core 
yes that s exactly what happens also sorry for taking so long to respond 
that s a good idea same for location belongs to belongsto parent 
that is good not all people need this feature but for those that do it would be a great asset to have 
hi i like the new interface better than what it was before and it was fairly easy for me to get around the code afaik the table options such as collation default character set engine etc only come in the end and are all separated by whitespace in a create table statement https github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize query generator js l 11 l11 https github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize query generator js l 2225 l2225 https github com pinetechlabs sequelize blob rewrite lib sequelize model definition js l 54 l54 additional table creation options could be separately passed inside options  table options tableoptions  engine innodb default character set  big 5 big5 
not changing attributes just reading them workflow is like this get foo getfoo json stringify send to view it s not a big problem but sometimes it s nice to be able to handle attributes in fewest places possible how complicated it would be to add this kind of behavior as optional must ask because well x 15x had exactly that 
i m working more with entity factory associations which seems to have about the same info as model associations determining the relation type one to many etc seems like a bit of guesswork as there isn t any clear info on that maybe just adding something like association type associationtype one to many onetomany to each association would do the trick also i noticed that many to one associations don t have the accessors array of functions although they are later declared on the entity itself 
looks like it works as expected on master thanks 
i guess people misunderstand i was just wondering why sequelize source has little to none semicolons i have to admit i m great supporter of using semicolons heck i wouldn t mind to convert sequelize however i have to agree that it is important that you respect some 1 some1 elses code style 
mickhansen i use sequelize 170 without raw true has same problem
the above is just something i created on the spot but definitions and associations would probably look like this 
nope i m afraid not see my other issue https 944https github com sequelize sequelize issues 944
current master branch
yep it is a self association same thing when i use through as is  i get the same error object groups outsourcing companies has no method init my group model is pretty big but there s nothing really special about it just lots of fields an after create aftercreate hook a couple of instance methods not too sure what more i can provide 
yeah i figured with the dao change we might of have that i ll have to refactor a lot of code that s how i made it work before i think i may of figured out why this is happening in my controller i have the following  so i tell it just to update the attributes that has been requested to be updated so if i change another value in my hook it doesn t update it as it s not in the object keys req body concat id array this behavior didn t happen before probably because my values before was limited to the array i provided it so if i added a key in the array it updated that value because it updated everything in that array 
my mistake it was indeed working the issue stemmed from the process of updating the instance which is another topic deserving of another issue this can be closed thank you for the clarification 
version 160 the error type error typeerror property string of object object is not a function
sorry guys i installed the v 2 v2 beta by mistake it works for 17
seems like it might support ident authentications in which case peer authentications wouldn t be too far off
sure thing content block contentblock 
i ll mess around with it a bit more to see if i can give a bit more info i ve not done much testing yet as far as tdd bdd goes getting started with it using mocha chai 
sorry forgot that v rc 8 170rc8
figured out what the problem was i was pulling all blocks from the table and one of those blocks did not have a worker because it was corrupted it s worker value was null so sequelize threw an error is there any way to have sequelize keep going instead of exiting when it finds a null value like that 
v dev 10 v200dev10 i m passing the query through from the browsers query string doing some transforming what you are suggesting is not the same getting all of projects that belong to user age 3 is not the same as getting all projects then including only users with age unless 3unless i m mistaken the above syntax
e g i have some models  i want to get followers but use offset and limit i want to get a object like count  rows 
i am using postgre sql postgresql 935 and sequelize rc 1 200rc1
not by default from the docs http www postgresql org docs current static uuid ossp html one has to install the ossp module which could do that otherwise write a sequence which could handle that but when i do that how could i refference my sequence in the model definition 
rc 3 170rc3
http sequelizejs com docs usage 178usage block line 4line 17
sorry i totally forgot about this so it seems that this behaviour is intentional in my opinion it is totally not intuitive and will cause more trouble than it helps fortunately it is easy to bypass it like this 
no i didn t i do not understand what you mean because your code is similar to mine can write a complete example please 
mickhansen i m sorry my mistake it s working now thanks for your answer 
mysql i m going to look into this more now 
model definitions with associations abridged  i put a console log near line 1688 in model js where the error message is emitted and found that the validate included elements validateincludedelements function was being called twice the first time it was called with the include block that i passed it in the find call the second time it was called it was passed the array groups users groupsusers 
tried it with version 170 and 175
i m using 175 and my apologies if i understand correctly the constraints should really only be defined from the belong to belongto function right since it s at that moment being told which table is it s parent that would make sense to me but maybe i m wrong i ve tried adding the on delete ondelete option but it doesn t seem to make a difference 
options include model a as a a create sucess b create values options success function b  should see b a here but not 
the version is rc 8 rc8 postgres the code is simple for example a b you call b destroy then a is deleted as well however if you call a destroy the error is raised up i think maybe i override the destroy method on instance now it returns a promise 
mickhansen no 
janmeier sequelize 201
i ve modified the code since but they re mostly just like this 
yes i fear node inspector doesnt allow this i d like to get the results of the queries it s convenient to check the result sets of queries as i type maybe i m the only one with bad habits i confirm i see the generated sql 
janmeier are you looking for code or the test environment details 
mickhansen thanks for responding which sql would this be this seems to break before any sql gets involved 
hi i m working at version rc 2 200rc2 my model definition below 
yeah the code is very simple just define a model and do sync so not much meaning i just want to see if sequelize can be used in node webkit now i just use the driver of mysql in node webkit and use sequelize to generate the sql query statement 
sure thing let s say i have the following model but it doesn t work and i can t find out how it should work 
randomly i m storing stock history data in a database for all s p 500 companies for each company i get the moving averages for 30 60 90 360 days and store it that s upwards of 200000 inserts per company the db is housed on a remote vps and the calculations are done on my pc so i m doing these one at a time because the memory required for each is high while working one by one it will randomly give me this error maybe every 2030 companies or so it is a very network heavy and lengthy process i am sshed into the box and in a mysql client to check the counts periodically select count from ma ticks maticks when this happens when i run that query again it says i ve been disconnected from the mysql server and then reconnects me so the mysql server seems to be shutting me down not the server itself 
it appears to hang indefinitely with some fiddling in generic pool js i enabled logging and it seemed to run destroy once but it does not seem to have destroyed that connection so it appears the process is genuinely waiting for the connection to close hanging indefinitely after sequelize close fails to close it rather than hanging on something else 
say i have this mapping child object childobject belongs to belongsto parent object parentobject foreign key foreignkey child id as child now say i ve assigned a child object instance to a parent and now i want to set that foreign key back to null undefined so that the child still remains in the database but the parent won t point to it any more i tried using parent set child id null undefined or parent set child setchild undefined and then saving and my change is never persisted because the query that gets executed refuses to set that value to null so to go around this i m using sequelize query with a raw update query and i was wondering if there s a way to do what i need to if sequelize is initialized with omit null omitnull true would the alternative be to set omit null omitnull to false and then run the set method with reset true is the default sequelize behavior when omit null omitnull is false not to overwrite existing values with nulls unless reset true is specified in the setter 
janmeier yes in my specific use case an upsert hook would work i have some functions that i need to run whether a model is created or updated so i already have model hook after create aftercreate my function myfunction model hook after update afterupdate my function myfunction but for certain use cases i need to do an upsert which means that neither of the above runs so an after upsert afterupsert hook would be neat 
got sloppy while reading documentation sorry for raising the issue and thanks for help
wow thats a quick reaction thanks i tested with sequelize 205 i think the test should check that the generated query contains the value as in sql 
it s simply just a call like  but say for username i allow alphanumeric only if i give it something invalid it will pass and update the first name value but just keep the original value of username maybe this is intentional but i think it d be more helpful to throw an error and be stricter 
310
the model definition for loyalty point loyaltypoint thanks for the fast feedback 
the way i m doing to json tojson definition is the following so then there s any way to make it without ssacl i mean i don t want those 2 values in any case they re used only for auth and shouldn t be available for anyone well only for that auth part 
i noticed something strange in the log set status setstatus just take ms 22ms when i remove the set status setstatus this transaction would take ms 50ms and i removed the transaction this part take more then s 1s and set status setstatus take about ms 20ms when i remove the set status setstatus this part take about ms 50ms i seem to find the problem 
my mistake i had a limit 10 in my query as well still i d assume limit 10 maps to select top 10 which doesn t require an order by in ms sql 
user js
yes it works with all combinations of underscored extra fields i d really prefer not to have to deal with the case sensitivity though 
thank you for your answer i will try it on monday morning 
hello janmeier i m trying to add an object to an a collection in another object who has an has many hasmany association this is the code  in version v 320 v320 the add user adduser method send 2 queries select from user where project id projectid  and id is null insert into user this read is not necessary because always returns 0 rows in version v 332 the add user adduser method sends only one query  update user set project id projectid  where id in null the add user adduser method don t have to send an update in this case why this extrange behaviours thanks
when i do an order like order created at createdat asc everything works fine however order created at createdat asc executes as order by created at createdat asc and throws sequelize database error sequelizedatabaseerror column created at createdat asc does not exist the first case is not super helpful because we want to order by multiple json fields last name lastname first name firstname 
yeah already did that thanks anyway
i have that left as default i don t see how that could be affecting this as the query that sequelize is executing is output in the console as select from foo 2015070120150731 it seems that only affects results coming back from the db 
janmeier it s not working because postgres treats as an escape character an thus looks for foo string with percent symbol it could be easily fixed by adding escape so like foo escape will work exactly like sq lite sqlite equivalent 
internally i assume you will use a find or find all findall when a model is included no i don t think i should call the hook myself but sequelize should be calling a hook automatically when i include the model and my goal is to make the model include more associations so after find afterfind is not an option though while you re at it that could be added aswell here is a code snippet of what i m trying to achieve so i suggest either having before find beforefind called when you include or having a new hook to handle this 
with navicat premium gui the incorrect value is what is being returned from our api the value in question doesn t go through any processing it is just part of the model definition and the return values from the find method i am testing my api with postman 
i see so it appears that sequelize mysql is using sequelize x 17x as dependency so that s why data types datatypes vitrual is null that should be the problem thanks 
that should work although requiring an overwrite of native objects to make something work feels a bit hacky 
unhandled reqection sequelize database error sequelizedatabaseerror sqlite error near where syntax error
it would set the foreign key organisation id organisationid on products in this case but potentially any other value that was specified going through the nested create code https github com sequelize sequelize blob master lib instance js l 719 l719 i see that the include object is used to set the foreign key if another option was passed it could be accessed to set values 
sushantdhiman i am on 3270 the latest version on npm in general i would like to pull from npm as opposed to github also master looks to have 4 on it which i thought was still unstable that said i will give master a try and report back 
yes literally any string fails regardless of length for example here i m passing in password which is between 6 and 20 characters so should theoretically go through  if i remove the len validator it works fine all the other validators i m using seem to be operating normally ie is email isemail not empty notempty etc 
you re right i ll create a bug report over there the problem is with multiple apostrophes by the way not a single edit see https github com brianc node postgres issues 934
it should be set to hst hawaiian standard time we have people in hawaii and the philippines entering in records is there a sequelize settings that will store all records as hst 
updated
no i need user role opts truly i can t imagine any good semantics for this thank you 
we upgraded from 17 and fixed all breaking changes a couple months ago we had run these commands successfully under the old api but probably not with 20 this feels like pretty basic functionality is the only suggested solution to upgrade to 30 and deal with the next batch of api and breaking changes 
hi this is the only input i pass the rest of the values are null or default value defaultvalue set input username myusername email a b com password mypassword my model has 41 fields exactly consisting integer and string types 3 of which are json arrays as strings that said the only output from sequelize is the insert sql statement that s syntactically correct and actually inserts the data into the database to recreate the problem you can just make a model with exactly 41 fields 3 consisting of the get set methods i pasted and see if you get the same error if you cannot re create happy to do a screenshare to show you exactly what i m seeing i m debugging as we speak 
janmeier thank you for your reply as you say i should t use webpack resolve sequelize so i modify webpack s config file  this error look about electron sqlite i m going to destroy it 
sushantdhiman simplifying the queries and reducing  of bytes sent isn t enough of a reason to add a couple lines of code 
i didn t have the text upfront but i did some digging in the rollbar reports and narrowed the issue down to a string like this u foo u0000foo 
i have tried the include multiple ways the through breaks it when i remove it it doesn t access the skill table at all include  model db skill as skills  include  model db skill through user skills userskills as skills 
logged query  unhandled rejection sequelize database error sequelizedatabaseerror the multi part identifier offers id could not be bound the order clause is getting added in query twice where is should be at the end on entire query like sql query order by id offset 10 rows fetch next 10 rows 
mickhansen yes i tried integer unsigned warring too i tried use sequelize integer there is no warring so i will use sequelize integer 
janmeier because it does not insert model id and other properties let suppose this code model build name some name set relation setrelation target id and name will non saved only relation 
is it possible using
felixfbecker nope that worked 
hmm this is on mac i did not get this warning before i am trying other versions of node to see if it depends on that 
options are include post  is a transaction the only way to do it or can we validate both before creating either 
i would have to respectfully disagree as it causing a confusing behavior when something like belongs to belongsto follows said behavior when using as in my example i have made the following associations  in this case belongs to belongsto assigns the attribute segment id segmentid to company employee companyemployee company employee companyemployee belongs to belongsto team as segment  in this case has many hasmany assigned team id teamid to company employee companyemployee team has many hasmany company employee companyemployee as segment its clear in this example that the associated foreign key foreignkey should be consistent so either make all of them produce team id teamid or all of them produce segment id segmentid furthermore i would still suggest that the foreign key foreignkey be segment id segmentid the aliased name because the commonly expected foreign key foreignkey of a source table generally includes the table name in it when using the alias it means that for all intents and purposes company employee companyemployee sees a segment table and has no knowledge of team table and the reverse should be true as well as a team i am representing myself as a segment there may be some legitimate case for wanting to alias a table without expecting the default foreign key foreignkey to be aliased as well but i can t think of a good one it seems to be a completely internal effect without the right foreign key foreignkey alias as well whatever the preferred result by the community is a consistent result needs to be enforced one way or the other 
felixfbecker i don t think i saw it documented anywhere just how i would expect it to work sushantdhiman thanks i ll check it out 
felixfbecker when i call table sync sequelize will create a table in db so i want you may add a similar func to create an udf maybe create udf createudf create function 
got it working my app js was not correct this was my last lines in app js  i guess the matcher was not needed 
sushantdhiman the stored procedure actually sets a value to the output parameter on executing the sp as a raw query only the select records are recieved in the callback any idea how we get the output parameters set in sp here is the code snippet for calling the stored procedure sequelize query exec stored procedure storedprocedure  spread function output value outputvalue records  console log records  error function err res json err  
it would be nice if it does it by itself if it needs the input object to have columns as its properties i dont see why it shouldn t work with the instance if the model as it has those props honestly i didn t think it wont work seems it can not read the pk from the instance 
yep in the service layer of my application i just map rows somthing like 
hello yes i ve fixed it for postgres it should be similiar fix for other dialects too eventually i should do a pull request basically moved the logging part outside the on end callback file sequelize lib dialects postgres query js from around 66 line sorry for bad formatting do we need benchmark for this query execution var benchmark this sequelize options benchmark this options benchmark var query begin querybegin 0 if benchmark  query begin querybegin date now  benchmark patch else this sequelize log executing  this client uuid default   this sql this options  var promise new promise function resolve reject  query on row function row  rows push row  query on error function err  set the client so that it will be reaped if the connection resets while executing if err code econnreset  self client invalid true  received error receivederror true err sql sql reject self format error formaterror err  query on end function result  benchmark patch if benchmark  self sequelize log executed  self client uuid default   self sql date now  query begin querybegin self options  if received error receivederror  return  resolve rows sql result  spread function rows sql result  benchmark patch if benchmark  self sequelize log executed  self client uuid default   self sql date now  query begin querybegin self options  else self sequelize log executing  self client uuid default   self sql self options 
sushantdhiman i modified the issue the one that i created earlier and then asked you if you will be kind enough to reopen it after waiting a couple of days if i remember correctly pardon me if i don t i created this new ticket because you never responded after you closed the original issue yes i am pretty sure that i am using mysql 2 mysql2 i produced the entire code that generates the error i took the error screenshot and pasted it here because it has the entire stack trace my only motive when i produced the image was to make it easier for anybody looking at it to easily decipher where the issue is as far as the node versions are concerned please find both the node version as well as npm version below node 840 npm 530
yes i forgot what it was though i might ve been catching it but i can responsibly tell you that it wasn t a bug armadill odyssey

it s not always broken and i tried from many different locations when it s broken for me the root page is working http docs sequelizejs com but the others url are not ex http docs sequelizejs com manual tutorial models definition html today its working but i got it broken many times 
oh i see sorry
i just meant debugging in vscode using hapijs lab test library with a small number of tables and models on a toy database as opposed to a real legacy database with a few dozen tables if i recall it turned out i actually been executing the same sequelize define code multiple times it was a case of 2 tables with the same name but different schema owners again apologies for the fuss 
simon schick simonschick hi here is table a is associated with b with key id 1 id1 table b is associated with c with key id 2 id2 a has many hasmany b b has many hasmany c expected query result 
it s just a simple code  after this the table does not change it remains the same 
off course simon schick simonschick i have three models   question
my initial though was that this happens automatically using this  associations is there a correct way to do that 
knoxcard i hadn t but just now did and it didn t have much of an impact looks like that did change between versions s 10s s 60s though
knoxcard many thanks you solutions do solve my problem except a little verbose as i need define getter on every fields it would be more elegant if we could do this  and more we could use use local time uselocaltime true to solve annoying timezone issues like this one https github com sequelize sequelize issues 10994
yes it does papb
at first it is documented but in general i can have multiple associations with the same class like 
papb hi unfortunately that is not a trivial task in my case since there are too many breaking changes to be able to switch to the latest sequelize version and test out the problem would you have links to any dummy sequelize project that uses the latest sequelize version 
yeah  force true flag would be good 
after further testing it looks like the problem is the length of string i changed column to string type i did the update from graph ql graphql playground and got error there is no problem when reading the long string back from the database 
i have updated the issue
sure but tomorrow it s 2 am and i m kinda sleepy but thanks for fast reply

papb thank you for your reply the flat true comes from my experience with django i use it all the time because of its convenience and calling find all findall with one column in attributes is a common case laravel eloquent orm also has this kind of feature i did some searching and found some many devs also want this feature like me  use include to return an array of ids https github com sequelize sequelize issues 5217 sequelize return array with strings instead of objects https stackoverflow com questions sequelize 33576129sequelize return array with strings instead of objects  eloquent orm laravel 5 get array of ids https stackoverflow com questions eloquent 34308169eloquent orm laravel get 5get array of ids i still prefer to implement it any suggestions for me 
i m new to both sq lite sqlite and sequelize so i can t suggest the best approach i did google a little bit before submitting my suggestions and they did make no sense sq lite sqlite doesn t support to drop a column or fk oh crap so the only suggestion that left on my list is parse the fk constraint and delete rows ourselves in the right order to this suggestion i added the note before googling at this point it should probably be a user addon in a different npm or the user should switch to on delete cascade so i totally agree with you about the feature label if you still go ahead and if there is nobody that already did this somewhere after thinking about it my recommendation would be close the issue i should have know sq lite sqlite limit 
yeap a bit new to js so my line for i i 1i i 10 basically created an infinite loop filling the list of items until everything crashed turns out to be my mistake rather than an issue with sequelize 
when will be it available i can see that it is not resolved in latest release 5217 as mentioned it seems that it is fixed on fd 04573fd and is in master are you planning on integrating that into v 5 v5 we need it at earliest we are one of end users of this sequalize v 5 v5 and production had issue because of this

fedora linux 30 intel xeon current generation use gcc installed version is 921
seberg frombuffer only works if you support the old buffer api i wanted to retain shape information so i implemented the new one strangely enough even though i have the old buffer methods numpy still complains i was assuming that numpy should directly interpret what i passed using the dtype that is passed np asarray buf complex 128 complex128 should be equivalent to using view instead of performing the conversion to double double first and then typecasting but i guess this would break conversions i ll use view then btw this could be related to a few issues  2465 2213

ok i will do it soon thank for the reply 
ok i see your point however can t see why it behaves differently for different empty arrays e g getting the minimum for axis 1 and axis 0 in s 2670s example both are empty still the minimum will be either an empty array or a value error valueerror to be honest i would be most happy with a nan as a result to min at least it seems more reasonable than an error 
this one came from the numpy org site also using off the shelf python install
ok so based on 12519 a simple workaround for us would be to avoid clip altogether and rely on core umath clip

python is the mac os x default python 278 on mac os 10101 yosemite numpy is running installed using virtualenv pip i e  let me know if there s any other output info i can get that would help 
i didn t build them nor do anything tricky what i did is just pip install numpy upgrade in a virtualenv s evironment before updating numpy still worked distro is archlinux 
ewmoore i understand your concern but at the moment the docs appear out of sync with code and that doesn t seem right i think we need to make it clear what we mean by usable and machine once we have clear definitions of those we can then determine whether the doc and or the code needs to change for example does the term machine refer to just the base architecture or the software compiled for it if i understand juliantaylor s comment correctly the architecture should always support subnormals however it depends on the compiliation of the software as to whether the end user can use it or not

in this case the norm function returns a float scala in my opinion it should take care of the overflow just like the square operation shown below i understand why it does not but it s not convenient for the users and is not documented in 3 a np array 0 0 256 dtype np int 16 int16 in 4 a 2 out 4 array 0 0 0 dtype int 16 int16  overflow here is expected in 6 a 22 out 6 65536  no overflow in 7 type a 22 out 7 numpy int 64 int64 in 8 type a 2 out 8 numpy int 16 int16

shoyer this is not always good idea sometimes you would like to have more bins than the array size for example when you have a sum of 2 gaussians first with mean 0 std 1 and the second with mean 100 std 1 and the array size 100 50 samples drown from the first gaussian 50 from the second then with 100 equally sized bins you won t be able to approximate it as the bin size will be 1

sorry my comment special case of an algorithm that generally works with n 1 dimensions was unclear the example i had in mind was implementing the gauss newton method for nonlinear least squares curve fitting it would be better to use a solve but suppose we are being sloppy the algorithm looks like def gauss newton x data y data param curve fn curve jacobian fn iters 20 for i in range iters residual y data curve fn x data param j curve jacobian fn x data param param param np linalg inv j t dot j dot j t dot residual return param where curve jacobian fn should return the jacobian of the curve function with respect to the parameters evaluated at each data point in x data in this case when the curve function has a single parameter it is natural in my opinion but maybe i m wrong to write curve jacobian fn to return a d 1d array then j t dot j is like 14 i tested the tuple index bug in 111 you are right it is replaced by the must be two dimensional exception

the fused function is in third party code stripped down to numfoo pyx in the linked gist it s that during the fused function s dispatching process which is entirely inside cython s control something causes an exception inside num py numpy s internals it looks like it is related to dynamic creation of user friendly looking wrappers of c functions but the traceback shown in the issue looks like the sort of thing that ought to happen upon importing something when both num py numpy s python layer and its c layer have both been imported already

so i managed to solve it and am no longer getting the message i tried a lot of different things but think what solved it was that i installed visual c build tool 140 which as i understand it is needed for pip i am fairly new to python and programming so maybe someone more experienced could confirm if this could be the solution or if it was something else i did it works in either case now 
this command is working the issue is that i m not able to import numpy and packages dependent on numpy in python through pybind 11 pybind11 any other packages such as requests is loading successfully 
yes you can 
hi both the argsort and the argpartition methods allow me to extract top k elements my request was that since this is a common scenario could we support this using a single method call user simply calls np argmax k argmaxk arr k  np max k maxk arr k and gets the k largest elements in sorted order

so how can i fix this error by updating the accelerate backend i had a search and don t think i can update that for my mac os macos 
we worked around it by assigning the result of the controller s method to a property and doing ng repeat against it i find it a little strange that ng repeat evaluates the collection portion of the expression more than once i expected the collection to be evaluated once at the beginning and i expected the result to be used in all the iterations of the ng repeat 
it is gone now but we should keep a look out for it in case it comes up again
hey igor i can reproduce pretty easily i m using eclipse mac as sanity check i tried it on vim and that worked i have seen eclipse sensitive to non ascii chars in the past not sure how to remedy other than forewarning eclipse users and recommend using a regular text editor as a means to the end which is something i do a lot these days thanks dan
well i have at least one other person in this thread who also thought it should work the way i do as well as someone talking about ugly work arounds to make it work this way i think our way should be supported https groups google com forum fromgroups topic angular hmpb czg 817hmpb8czg i find the currently supported sort of isolation scope to be pretty useless it would be much more useful if it isolated the directive from the template rather than isolating part of the template from the rest of the template 
nvm it s already been fixed in master 
davidjnelson this is the right context since all other directives do work absolutly fine plus the compile service bootstraps the template 
i kept receiving a chrome aww snap after finding out what an aww snap could be i was introduced to chromes profile and timeline tabs in the dev console it showed the heap size growing as time passed and garbage collection wasn t able to remove all instances i made sure there were no connections to objects etc and finally found that article once i changed it to set timeout settimeout garbage collection was able to happen correctly sorry for the lack of technical terms i ve only delved into this the last week on 06112012 113 pm igor minar notifications github com wrote 
i always assumed event delegates must be faster and take less memory i made some simple tests and it turns out my assumption was totally wrong the performance of both event delegation and directly binded event handlers was almost exactly the same in my test thanks for the quick response i should have researched more before opening this issue 
thanks i think i need some more information about how this works first i opened a thread on so http stackoverflow com questions angularjs 13558989angularjs resource and dollar sign in parameters further explanation would be helpful

for invoking almost anything i have yet to see an error thrown when the case doesn t match or mismatch as it were i m creating a simple example now edit also just to make sure i m being understood the problem is not that it doesn t work that s expected the problem is that no error at all is thrown when a user makes an error like that 
yes i think it should go everywhere as long as there s an initial value in the ng model ngmodel on fri nov 14 2014 at 207 pm narretz notifications github com wrote 
of course adding a scope variable is fine but i d much rather prefer do use the model itself to do this i could just return data from my model but then the following thing may happen scope model get items getitems x 0x 5 while i would prefer to set data to it using setter methods of course i control the whole application and i ll be careful not to do this but it s just about the fact that returning the internal data through a get function automatically makes it susceptible to writing operations i was only curious if there is a way around this that s all 
the difference with ng if is that this will update when the expression changes 
would hope one could add validator methods on a form controller formcontroller similar to ng model controller ngmodelcontroller except that possibly no value would be passed data would be brought in through services or a non isolated scope to have a way of separating this logic from the controller which could get bloated run these checks when form changes and not on form submission or via explicit scope watch and hook into error to be able to show error messages form level check are used to validate that information is congruent throughout the form  if a child has a birthdate that is earlier than the parent dynamic list of people with relationships  if someone tries to make multiple withdrawals worth more than a maximum or more than what they stated they would withdraw dynamic list of withdrawal slips sum 
i needed to make it recompile everytime because the twitter library replaces the original template that i set inside my directive i found that using interpolate and ng bind html unsafe made it work without the extra watchers since i m manually watching the text and element scope variables but thanks for the clarification it made my experience with angular js angularjs better 
it affects email and required fields
pkozlowski opensource i m indeed talking about the http requests that download partial html the views content is dispatched among various html files in order to keep them tidy and we d like to know when all ng included views are loaded in order to reveal the page only by then instead of seeing them add up one after the other when loading http interceptors could be useful but they are too broad for the use we don t really want to intercept all http requests only the ones requested by ng include nginclude hence the idea of catching some events notifying us that a new ng include nginclude http request was made incrementing a counter for each include and decrementing it on include content loaded includecontentloaded we could then assume that if the counter as reached 0 and stayed there for a certain amount of time everything is loaded and we can reveal the whole page i believe such an event would be useful in such circumstances and maybe others but please let me know if there is another way to achieve the same goal

exactly my point j query jquery behavior and angular jq lite jqlite are not equal when you call angular element input trigger handler triggerhandler change some data object somedataobject and j query jquery input trigger handler triggerhandler change some data object somedataobject j query jquery returns this object as on change onchange argument while angular completely ignores it reason is as described in my first post concatenation between array and object 
http plnkr co edit b ci p quy o y ytcavko xv b6cipquyo4yytcavkoxv here it is but i can t reproduce it on such a small scale it could be related maybe to sliding d 3d animations on switching between menu pages i will try to enrich it with animations to get closer to what we have in our app otherwise i can only send you link where to see it live thou obfuscated so no debugging would be possible 
janmarek there is no point to use real j query jquery just for one method
caitp the message in the block in not showed there is a discuss here http docs angularjs org api ng directive input number step to reproduce 1 add the validation for your input type number 2 type words 3 the message in span tags is not showed
i finally found out the issue if i directly assign the returned data to scope products then there is no problem but if i use jquery concat function then the result is repeated one more time 
i don t see any glitching in your non angular example so it is an angular problem the doc comments for add class addclass in angular animate js say that after the animation completes angular first removes the add and add active classes and then adds the unadorned class name so there s a short window of time where the element doesn t have any classes the comments even call this out explicitly as step 7 and that s probably where the glitch is coming from is there any reason it does things in that order it seems like it would make more sense to add the class first and then remove the add variants 
correct it is not a bug this is a request for comments concerns on mon sep 16 2013 at 313 pm pete bacon darwin notifications github com

hello my use case is a bit strange i have a mapping of number to string  and as you can see the comprehension permits filter chains not just plain expressions really nice and another thing i ve noticed that expression is parsed as an assignment https github com angular angular js blob master src ng parse js l 490 l490 so the following function call expression my function myfunction my var myvar 3 would also be valid i don t know about you but an assignment expression as a function argument seems stranger to me than a filter expression i also found filter chain filterchain in primary which allows me to do set value setvalue value int https github com angular angular js blob master src ng parse js l 601 l601 so you can call a function with a filter expression if you really want to but it s ugly from my experience with top down recursive look ahead parsers no other stuff would break with your proposed fix i m not a hundred percent sure but i don t think the grammar would allow for any ambiguities that would break previously correct expressions so to sum it up i know that my use case is strange but i ve shown that there are other strange use cases that are already possible and i think there s no real danger of breaking existing code so if it s not too much trouble please create a pull request with your proposed modification if not i could create one myself but i ve just created my github account and i m pretty sure it would take me significantly more time to do so thanks

this is something i have expected however in case the backend and the angular app are running on different domains subdomains ports such behaviour might be required i am still able to make the calls by using http defaults headers common x csrf token csrftoken cookies csrftoken before each call though it would be much nicer to be able to set it via http provider httpprovider 
good question did not have time to look through the full cost of step through it but the http and http backend httpbackend code is not trivial sure to the coalescing of different caching and other cases into one code line but google chrome and node server don t log see request when halting in debugger on promise then i had hoped somebody could either tell me that i am definitely mistaken or it s by design somehow that would speed up debugging original message from wawyed notifications github com sent 08092014 1732 to angular angular js angular js noreply github com cc matthiasg mgt gmail mgt576gmail com subject re angular js save resolves before network request 8978 what is triggering the resolve if not a xhr response  reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github

in chrome if there s a min or max attribute on an date input or input type number the native datepicker number picker widgets impose some restrictions for example if an input type date has a min attribute of 20150101 you won t be able to select a date prior to 20150101 in the calendar date picker

caitp what i mean is that without the double slashes angular js angularjs seems to load only part of the template arbitrarily omitting some of the elements that are in the template in other words i m purposefully having to leave the double slash so that my templates are fully loaded i don t want to remove the double slashes because then some of my templates get only partially loaded which is bad what i don t yet understand is why having double slashes makes my app work the way i wasn t what s interesting is that i stumbled on this behavior my templates losing properly with double slashes on accident i would ve never guessed it s totally bizarre maybe i can screen cast it 
thank you for your replay i will create it a pull request 
it is failing with ie 8 ie8 haven t checked other versions pawel i use resources for each webservice on my app it would be inconsistent to use http for a few corner cases like this but to me the main problem here is the poor debbuging output it would be more helpful to have angular clearly stating that you should not use primitive types because debbuging this under ie is a nightmare because it throws unhelpful messages headers is undefined 
definitely i ll see what i can do also thanks for the workaround i am doing something similar for the moment thanks again
caitp not actually a whole lot of html the main content is one repeater that runs about 25 times the page runs fine on low powered devices such as the hudl but causes this problem on the ipad 4 ipad4 and under so i don t think the page is abhorrently large

sorry i m aware that it s not a very useful complete bug report actually there could have been another issue involved and i maybe have jumped the shark by writing memory leak in the title this what i found for chrome https code google com p chromium issues detail id 151026 https code google com p chromium issues detail id 31014 the temporary fix is to to assign a unique id using a timer to the scr of the video source i ll check on ipad if i can still reproduce the issue with this particular workaround or see if i can prepare another testcase better report

i m trying to spy on a service method being called once something has happened in my controller but every guide i have followed doesn t seem to work 
narretz not sure what code i had since it changed but it was with 1314 i believe 
i would say that the order is not really important here the nullification happens every time an event gets dispatched and not during the library load instead i would suggest nulling those properties only when they fail the has own property hasownproperty check because that would cause a memory leak not my event prototype based solution 
sure that wouldn t be a problem when is good for you

that would do but sounds more like a workaround then a solution also those links are generated automatically through a breadcrumb directive and when i need to change the base url having to change it on two places doesn t look like a good choice 
i m using chrome browser and it s work fine in x 12x version i don t understand what you don t understand it s very simple in version x 12x the active changes effect on the ng class inside the template in the beggining when the control is initialized when the ng repeat apply on it because this line ng init nav nav active index activeindex 0 only the first directive get the active true and become a purple and the rest active false and the got the black color when you click on the directive it s become active true because this line click nav active index activeindex index and everithing works fine in x 13x when the control is initialized and ng repeate apply on the directive the active for all directive is not true and not false this is my problem i don t know why and therefore you see only white because the template is without any background color only when i click on it the active is updated and make the color changes ostensibly this bug don t have any relation to ng animate but if i delete the ng animate nganimate dependency everything work fine

the problem occurred when changing the input type of the hour and minute field of the timepicker to number instead of text maybe it has something to do with the model of those fields however it would make sense to have those fields as number inputs what else could you put there  it also brings up the correct keyboard on phones and tablets

yes good call short version instead of
key krusher keykrusher makes no sense because i have the code divided into many different pieces but i can try to explain what is happening because i have custom directives like ng dropdown i needed to connect angular form validation to the selected values i only managed to make it working by adding hidden input with it s model and then calling validate of this input field directly from dropdown on update callback
the specific usecase i m looking at is a registration form with a username field while the user is typing it should be checked if the username is unique of course we want to use a debounce here to not send a new request on every keystroke while the debounce is timing out however we want the submit button to be disabled since it cannot be guaranteed that the provided username will be unique not disabling the button during this period results in a brief 300 ms but real period of inconsistency setting up an async validator to run the uniqueness check provides us with the pending property on the ng model ngmodel we use this flag to disable the submit button the debounce option doesn t provide any such way to signal it s state however

because then i would have to change all the weapons that already exist and add wall as a target and that seemed klutzy if someone had made a mod they would have to update their weapons to let them shoot at walls guess it s a good thing no one plays cnc 
free coasts i started playing on crossroads and it works fine must have something to do with island maps 
wierd i enabled it the song does not play also how did i miss that 
cjshmyr yes it is correct and not an error but the maybe 4 orca fs will not be build when the fourth migis holded in the build qeue in ra 1 ra1 its also like this behavor you can only build 3 migs when you have 3 airfields 
i remember when i was messing with the msam and mlrs thing being all ocd about it i came across the same issues i thougt the icon in bits was mean t to just plain override the original 
well then the different versions would just pile up unless it uninstalled the old one too but ok 
i dunno i cant get it to happen again either maybe i was out of money for that moment or some shit

unfortunately not i had not even thought about asking not to mention i had not a way to ask is there coming a complete bug report system any time soon such that would use a hash code for each game and when a crash occurs hashcode so its easy to see which players played in the same game the crash logs are automatically uploaded from all users at the next startup of open ra openra shouldnt be too hard to implement and should speed up bug fixing too

phrohdoh speaking from c c generals modding it was very useful to be able to define a timed life for objects actors things such as radiation fields napalm fires etc is much easier to do when you have something like this it is a useful semi often used feature already several of the existing support powers could use this rather than managing the lifetime of the camera flare themselves i e removal of function duplication edit though looking at the code for the support powers i notice slight differences in the way they handle the camera removal so my previous statement isn t true edit

i have no idea never happened to me in the original ra 
thanks for the tip unit 158 unit158 i ll try it out the raffy theraffy i see maybe its role should be scouting then if it s determined to be currently too pricey not cost effective maybe some scouting features should be added like more vision instead of lowering its price 
henrythe slav henrytheslav i was thinking about that but wouldn t that be cpu intensive you d need to calculate the distance every time a unit makes a sound also where is the person listening located if you take the center of the camera you might not hear your units getting attacked on the other side of the map would be an interesting gameplay mechanic though if every actor is listening you have to calculate a lot more distances or maybe have a second smaller invisible sound shroud where units don t make the sound

well dogs aren t shooting something explosive so i don t know why they would cause an explosion the same could be said for zombies ants too i guess this was changed when grens were changed to always explode i think the 20170523 release it went unnoticed i guess 
no only this just stumbled over this  but i m not 100 sure if the fix is ok and also may the old version is more faster cause there should be no actor twice  may we can break the recursion after finding the first match

well seen i copy the game to my home directory home paul and it work there without the workaround copy of the directory 
this did it thank you very much however i am unfortunately still getting the graphics error however i will start a new issue for that as it is apparently not related to the make problem after all 
thank you both paul i m sorry i missed the latter part of your message in that issue about the compiling page installing libsdl 12200 libsdl12200 and libopenal 1 libopenal1 fixed this i will check to see if i have the rest of those packages again thank you guys for putting up with me x d xd

sorry i ll try to explain better if you go into your vm directory and type vagrant reload in your terminal your vm will reload right but imagine if you go into your vm directory and ssh into your running vagrant machine to get an access to the shell vagrant ssh command there s no way i can run a vagrant ssh from there that s what we are trying to do here at my job let me know if u know something we could do 
it s consistent tried 4 times in a row and got the same error never saw it before upgrading to 063 i m on mac os x 164 ruby 187 20090612 patchlevel 174 universal darwin 100 darwin100
me too i saw this just once but it stuck really hard only reboot of host solved this problem after that i ve never seen this again this package compiled successfully with the same parameters 
no together with it the knife bootstrap way also doesn t let you run vagrant up multiple times which is also not handy i m currently more thinking into the direction of implementing an auto install of chef when the binary is not installed 
thanks for your answer here is the vagrantifle included in the box 
is this released maybe i need to update my gem should have looked myself before i opened this issue 
i have tried this one on 2 different networks in 2 different countries actually norway and poland so this doesn t look like dns hick up to me i ll upgrade to latest virtual box virtualbox and report back

here is the vagrant log debug output https gist github com bartmeuris db a e 71353db039334267a35e
i ve reported the issue upstream net ssh net ssh issues 92 but the issue still remains in vagrant i find that i can work around the issue by stopping my agent process but that s far from ideal perhaps there s something vagrant can do to work around the issue until it s resolved in net ssh for example since vagrant already has the key it doesn t really need to use the agent at all perhaps vagrant could disable agent support at least for the management processes so it runs like it did in 10
as you can t see other users v ms vms with v box manage vboxmanage list xx it seems that the solution is going to be hard to find i see 2 options  add a flag or config option in vagrant to disable that cleanup this could also be done at confirmation on the destroy dialog  remove the cleanup probably not wanted

1 create foo box file 2 run vagrant up 3 run vagrant destroy 4 update foo box file 5 run vagrant up  at this point vagrant does not download unpack the update newer box file it uses the cached version which is a pain if you are iterating on a box it would be nice if there were a flag like force download to update the cached version

i did it in command prompt 
sure here s the relevant portion of my vagrantfile  as you can see the only parameters i m actually passing to the get url module are url and dest yet ansible complains that i m passing the couchdb bind address as a parameter kind of weird as i said earlier my playbook works fine with vagrant 127
i did it output follows note the machine went into guru meditation mode after the vagrant up failed provider virtualbox that probably cause the second error cant unlock or do something with it in virtualbox i have to reboot the system 
i deleted all folder vagrant and it didnt help this is my vagrant file 
thanks for the quick response your given keywords helped me to solve it with some googling sadly i did not know what exactly caused it to work but what i tried is  tried vagrant share after that again and it works  i removed etc ssl certs vagrant share vagrantshare pem and executed sudo c rehash etc ssl certs again so i got the state i had before when it was not working but surprisingly vagrant share still works so i really don t have clue what did the trick in the end however thank you and keep on the great work guys 
i saw a couple behaviors first one user had a directory several levels under is home then had a projects library when under this directory the machine hangs at boot the debug log showed it repeatedly trying to ssh to the guest and failing moving the vagrantfile to another directory solved the issue second the vagrant file was in a directory and it worked find however when that directory was added to the documents library and accessed that way it could not be deleted without being first moved with a series of permission denied errors when a vagrant destroy was issued 
yep that s it embarrassed i didn t find that it via github search disappointed 
1 make sure your base box is not installed 2 set box url in vagrantfile 3 use vagrant berkshelf with chef solo to provision vm 4 vagrant up which downloads the box and builds the vm in one execution in 9 out of 10 cases it didn t mount the cookbooks shared folder for me however when the base box is installed everything seems to work fine 
 mode ruby  vi set ft ruby  vagrantfile api syntax version don t touch unless you know what you re doing vagrantfile api version 2 vagrant configure vagrantfile api version do config config vm define jooq do jooq end config vm hostname jooq if vagrant has plugin vagrant cachier config cache auto detect true end  all vagrant configuration is done here the most common configuration  options are documented and commented below for a complete reference  please see the online documentation at vagrantup com  every vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of config vm box trusty 64 trusty64  disable automatic box update checking if you disable this then  boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs  vagrant box outdated this is not recommended  config vm box check update false  create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port  within the machine from a port on the host machine in the example below  accessing localhost 8080 will access port 80 on the guest machine  config vm network forwarded port guest 80 host 8080  create a private network which allows host only access to the machine  using a specific ip config vm network private network ip 1921681010  create a public network which generally matched to bridged network  bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on  your network  config vm network public network  if true then any ssh connections made will enable agent forwarding  default value false  config ssh forward agent true  share an additional folder to the guest vm the first argument is  the path on the host to the actual folder the second argument is  the path on the guest to mount the folder and the optional third  argument is a set of non required options  config vm synced folder data vagrant data  provider specific configuration so you can fine tune various  backing providers for vagrant these expose provider specific options  example for virtual box virtualbox   config vm provider virtualbox do vb   don t boot with headless mode  vb gui true    use v box manage vboxmanage to customize the vm for example to change memory  vb customize modifyvm id memory 1024  end   view the documentation for the provider you re using for more  information on available options  enable provisioning with cf engine cfengine cf engine cfengine community packages are  automatically installed for example configure the host as a  policy server and optionally a policy file to run   config vm provision cfengine do cf  cf am policy hub true   cf run file motd cf  end   you can also configure and bootstrap a client to an existing  policy server   config vm provision cfengine do cf  cf policy server address 100215  end  enable provisioning with puppet stand alone puppet manifests  are contained in a directory path relative to this vagrantfile  you will need to create the manifests directory and a manifest in  the file default pp in the manifests path directory   config vm provision puppet do puppet  puppet manifests path manifests  puppet manifest file site pp  end  enable provisioning with chef solo specifying a cookbooks path roles  path and data bags path all relative to this vagrantfile and adding  some recipes and or roles   config vm provision chef solo do chef  chef cookbooks path my recipes cookbooks  chef roles path my recipes roles  chef data bags path my recipes data bags  chef add recipe mysql  chef add role web    you may also specify custom json attributes  chef json  mysql password foo   end  enable provisioning with chef server specifying the chef server url  and the path to the validation key relative to this vagrantfile   the opscode platform uses https substitute your organization for  orgname in the url and validation key   if you have your own chef server use the appropriate url which may be  http instead of https depending on your configuration also change the  validation key to validation pem   config vm provision chef client do chef  chef chef server url https api opscode com organizations orgname  chef validation key path orgname validator pem  end   if you re using the opscode platform your validator client is  orgname validator replacing orgname with your organization name   if you have your own chef server the default validation client name is  chef validator unless you changed the configuration   chef validation client name orgname validator end

whats the location for the debug log 
crap i meant virtual box virtualbox not vagrant sorry just from the virtual box virtualbox menu virtual box virtualbox check for updates
it just happens with my boxes not sure which exactly actions cause this but here is debug log https gist github com mkuzmin b d e c 62 1670b4550d42557e8c62

i will i assumed that the www getchef com was coming from vagrant thanks again for being so responsive 
you can see the spelling is correct above from the ls output here is ls l showing the permissions vagrant is being executed by the alterian user ls l boxes cent os centos box 65400box rw rw r 1 alterian alterian 377446400 nov 5 0247 boxes cent os centos box 65400box
yep 
restart does not help i tried it few times workaround for this problem is to change configuration of the default virtual box virtualbox host only ethernet adapter to have  in this case vagrant matches default adapter as applicable for work and so use it instead of creating new one 
if the docs had shown their version today i could have noticed a discrepancy between the version i m using 172 and the version of the docs post 172 i understand that this is normally not necessary but it helps prevent confusion in case of error 
yeah i found it in opt for some reason my find wasn t finding

hi sethvargo thanks first for your answer it s very appreciated here is my gist https gist github com coolfarmer f f a b a a a c 8f9f17a8b35a59a75a2c i don t have found the solution i hope you can tell me anything i don t already see on google

what if you have multiple boxes why did vagrant ssh work to each of them on wed may 20 2015 0632 seth vargo notifications github com wrote 
this is working now 
imho it is not it appears that his need was starting n of xyz whereas this matches with the basic philosophy of once you or someone else creates a single vagrantfile you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work where the entire system is upped in the sequence required the difference between this concept and that of the current implementation is that now we would have to disable parallel booting in order to satisfy dependencies so long as we add the v ms vms in the order required my suggestion would allow vagrant to determine which v ms vms would need booted in what order and allow parallel booting when possible 
i m trying to use vagrant to test my ansible configstack so terraform isn t an alternative here i will try to reproduce this without using ansible provisioning currently i guess it s a virtualbox networking issue

thanks for reply and running the test i ve upgraded vagrant to v 174 v174 and virtual box virtualbox to v r 101573 v500r101573 and it s still the same it actually hangs at the same point that you provided the last line  is your script actually finishes the execution which means going back to the shell prompt which i believe it should or it s expected behaviour that the ruby process is in endless waiting state 
i was thinking checking whether the password is 3 characters printing password must be at least four characters long and prompting me for the password again if not would be nicer

hi sethvargo thank you for the welcome message i installed vagrant with the ubuntu package manager apt get install y vagrant but it seems that the version of vagrant that comes with it is very old so to fix this issue i installed the latest version of vagrant via the deb file provided in the vagrant s download page 
hi the vagrant file is at https gist github com csogilvie fa ba c eaa 49 24fa3915ba3c012eaa49 note that this has a block for aws in it as well but this is not being used in this case 
sethvargo i also tried that but i am getting the same error 
not sure what other information i can provide i run the exact same commands as you and ssh simply hangs i suspect this is because of the virtualbox network not being brought up or routed what s the output from your ip addr and ip route on the host system and just to double check you are also using debian 9 on the host system right 
vagrant file  only after that did i get the error in the issue
but it works in other computers other than in my laptop and yes there was already an issue but i closed it since it appears to be attached to my own setup  any other hints see https github com taigaio taiga vagrant issues 21
okay but just works implies that vagrant should do the same thing in most circumstances if i run vagrant halt my environment should halt and stop using resources also we don t use boot docker boot2docker we use coreos for the docker host machine and while that s still a relatively low resource vm i still don t want it running in the background all the time if i open a pr to stop the docket host machine after vagrant halt finishes possibly with an environment variable to opt out of that would it be accepted i ve got most of the code working as a plugin already and there s not a lot to it 
https github com mitchellh vagrant aws issues 444 done
here are my steps windows 7 x 64 x64 installed a version some months ago deleted the installation kit from the download dir last week decided to upgrade so downloaded the latest installation kit started the installation it detected there s an older install and asked for the old installation kit the one downloaded a while back try yourself the upgrade but first remove the old kit maybe it s a problem of the old kit now fixed 
sethvargo i can confirm this does not happen if vagrant berkshelf plugin is removed so is it chef or vagrant that is now confused about where to get home made cookbooks 
sethvargo that does make sense but having a variety of exit codes is not unheard of eg nagios checks i don t think exit codes and human readable output should be conflated or that exit codes should be abandoned altogether if we are going to require parsing of string output instead of relying on exit codes then we should have a machine readable status like json

hi sethvargo thanks for the quick reply config ssh pty true did not help testing that out did get me thinking about alternate ways to achieve the same aim in my use case i only need to skip once something in provisioning has failed in order to troubleshoot we use the hostmanager plugin and we have an inventory file so it becomes a simple matter of running ansible playbook outside of vagrant e g ansible playbook i inventorydir playbook yml step u vagrant ask pass so now that i understand that interactive provisioning is not supported by vagrant and i have a workaround i ll go ahead and close this issue thanks again david

does this happen every time you bring up a guest  yes do you have any other machines or instances of vagrant running  no have you tried running vagrant outside of wsl like in powershell  i tried running with windows bit 64bit version of vagrant but there was different error output when vagrant tried to ssh to the guest machine  default importing base box centos 7 default matching mac address for nat networking  default checking if box centos 7 version 190201 is up to date  default setting the name of the vm set default 156039595156731314 default clearing any previously set network interfaces  default preparing network interfaces based on configuration default adapter 1 nat default forwarding ports default 22 guest  2222 host adapter 1 default booting vm  default waiting for machine to boot this may take a few minutes default ssh address 1270012222 default ssh username vagrant default ssh auth method private key timed out while waiting for the machine to boot this means that vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within the configured config vm boot timeout value time period br if you look above you should be able to see the error s that vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine these errors are usually good hints as to what may be wrong br if you re using a custom box make sure that networking is properly working and you re able to connect to the machine it is a common problem that networking isn t setup properly in these boxes verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly as well br if the box appears to be booting properly you may want to increase the timeout config vm boot timeout value debug output https drv 1drv ms u s al v gh o ej wr wk i vym nme fhm vg k alvgho4ejwrwk0ivymnme5fhmvgk
it looks like this was the result of a restore from an automated backup where artifacts were included for some reason wiped them out running uninstall through the 226 msi and it ran cleanly 
on mint 171 gcc version ubuntu ubuntu 1 48219ubuntu1 482 i run it as  edit actually i just tested with only safe code onlysafecode false as well as only safe code onlysafecode true same result in both instances not sure how it worked for def 
fowlmouth it does varriount the idea is to generate an error with a message containing all the symbols that have neither been referenced nor excluded this simplifies the task of making sure that a wrapper is up to date with the associated bindings 
i would be satisfied if it just displayed error and refused to compile the continue statement on such fake loops where it is not implemented 
that it works for variables declared within try is largely useless since what you want is a mechanism for undoing a failed try clause for which you have to record how far it got within the try clause along with any undo operations but variables declared within the try clause have lifetime limited by the try clause so they don t need to be protected from setjmp semantics in the first place and they can t be accessed outside the try clause so they can t be used within an except clause the semantics that you need is to make variables volatile that are assigned to within a try clause but declared outside it right now the current implementation has only very limited applicability namely for a workaround prefix the entire function with a finally discard statement which implicitly puts everything inside in a try clause but also creates overhead due to requiring another setjmp 
whoops you are right perlandric i dont know exactly what was wrong here but this code works well i ll reopen it if i found out what was the issue 
it stops being hygienic  why does show value showvalue leak but not i or my foo myfoo 
no see my above example it works with the c back end i named it write file writefile nim because that is what i was having issues with but again now with a different file name same results 
darn it did work actually i ve been using dimensional 0dimensional arrays for the past couple months then pulled the latest devel branch hoping it would fix some obscure code generation bug i was experiencing a couple months ago i switched from using tuples to arrays to represent n dimensional tensor indices using tuples required a lot more code generation making the switch let me compile my test suite in 03 seconds instead of 10 seconds it would be great if this could be supported at some point d 0d arrays come up  when scalars interact with tensors e g via promotion broadcasting http docs scipy org doc numpy user basics broadcasting html  in the base cases of operations defined recursively on arbitrary rank tensors e g printing folds reductions index transformations though i understand the low priority tag given that the manual doesn t actually say this should work 
i don t know but i think when set position setposition is available something like cut should be possible also at least i needed a cut operation for a string stream recently but indeed maybe using just a plain string would have been the better solution i used string stream because i saw some people using it one of these was jason m for his smart gi work and i think that i should better not admit that i had some trouble understanding the streams manual at all for example when flush is necessary or if first closing the stream and then writing string to file or first writing to file and closing finally 
edit from varriount error output is here https gist github com varriount b f b a d de bb 7b80f292b21a8d5de7bb
def yes i should have mentioned that it simply depends on whether a subthread terminates before the main thread if the subthread runs indefinitely everything is fine 
i tried to find it but even this is tough the exact example i have given also seems to fail with fairly old versions of nim i have some other variants of this failure i ll have to see if i can bisect them maybe it isn t a regression after all and i just happened to run into it much more often now 
can be reproduced on devel git hash fd fef ea fe a f f e f f dbb 5334fd453317fef04ea929fe4a4f4f2e0f6f5dbb make sure you use c backend nim cpp r and as an additional detail i use mac os macos and clang to compile the generated code 
of my msgpack nim library https github com akiradeveloper msgpack nim the latest e d f af b ba ff c f 6e0d873f275af0469b868747946ba012ff111c2f is broken when we run make quickcheck the task first generates random test cases and feeds them to msgpack library so whether it fails or not depends on the randomness i narrowed down the problem and which i showed above is the minimum case to reproduce the problem this problem didn t appear at mar 25 so some degradation can be suspected since f is accepted by the compiler there is no way the third case g 0 isn t 
version 530
as a quick fix on my code i am doing this  not the pest idea as it uses exceptions as part of the work flow there is also the memfiles http nim lang org docs memfiles html but i did not have the chance play with it yet 
here you go 20150619 14 55 https 34https cloud githubusercontent com assets aff f e 734077282610346aff0f4e e f a bce c 169511e583f97a59bce6454c png 
i don t think the referenced issue has any more details about this issue define private public the still unreported as of now os x issue is unrelated 
the easiest perhaps follow this steps 
if we modify the last line of the additional code  this seems accepted by compiler internal probably no need to revert the problematic commits and more importantly no need to add a new proc than can increase compiler internal complexity but of course always measure before make any cuts 
it works but this issue also a valid bug for clang users coz we explicitly asking for the cast but the compiler refuse to generate it 
i was linking initially this can be a feature of distinct but on second thoughts it is better as part of effect to track units and measures 
let produces the same error as var both inside and outside the parallel block const changes the error to a disjoint error 11 not disjoint from 11
ok my code is here https github com xland nimcn this error occurred when i compile my program with nim 0120
apologies i forgot to mention this is only with the cpp backend the c backend works fine unfortunately my project depends on the cpp backend due to various external dependencies i verified this to still be present with head 131 and the cpp backend in use 
i use nim 0112 and want to write a app to parse command line args so i use docopt lib but when i compile the source i get the error error redefinition of util so i turn to use nim on github the devel branch and the error gone i dont know why please close this issue 
the point a larger subset of nim stdlib and ecosystem being usable in environments where gc is not acceptable eg domains where only c c rust or ada may be used it would be like gc none that always becomes a compile error if a given function has that pragma but you re right given that gc none is available it s a lot less relevant people can make github pull requests or make their own modules where gc none doesn t give any warnings for those kinds of environments thanks for the reminder 
araq could you please elaborate i m not sure i understand what you re referring to are you referring to this line in produce proc produceproc  my guess is the n creates a thread local string that then tries to get processed in consume proc consumeproc causing the thing to fail or did you manage to spot something else i have to tell errors like this are super easy to make just like in c and this makes nim quite error prone and hard to use correctly in multithreaded scenarios unfortunately 
documentation can also be useful to explore a new codebase without looking at the exact implementation this can be very useful when you want to explore the overall structure of a file without diving into the specifics other documentation systems such as doxygen provide features to document private members for exactly this reason 
well nim has object inheritance and being able to make a copy of an object is one of the more basic things you could hope to do in a system with object inheritance if nim is going to have barriers to basic uses of object inheritance maybe it should not have included the feature edit it has been explained to me that you can just do this with deep copy deepcopy so apparently the language does support this oops 
yes the header files are installed  sfml is installed via doas pkg add sfml this test is also disabled on free bsd freebsd for similar reasons and is also disabled on windows 
nice investigation kaushalmodi 
if the anonymous gists created by the playground are never deleted we could use that otherwise it should be collaborative gists ideally under nim lang project 
andreaferretti the thing is it s not even ambiguous in the test case 
linux works on windows
say i want to support ascii doc asciidoc nim doc comments or github markdown or something else all start from plain text code already exists to parse and format from that and the structure captured in the html is not the structure i want i think it would be cool to write some code that generates the complete documentation for a project including the index i have some ideas that might make it better than what s currently available to do that i need more control over the formatting and i would like to work in plain text as written in the source until the end when it gets converted to one or more final output formats 
andreaferretti the output loses the backticks around which causes a weird parsing error separately it isn t usable for this specific purpose because it automatically imports all of the current module but i think there is a general issue with its handling of backticks 
dom 96 dom96 yes in terminal works fine i think it must be moved to vscode here https github com pragmagic vscode nim issues 85 is another issue for std io and vscode 
i followed https nim lang org install unix html i installed gcc via yum y install gcc before hand i though nim was interesting and wanted to give it a try please don t allow a failure on such simple task make a bad taste of nim if there is a way to produce more informative message let me know thanks
ok seems a little bit weird 
i can step over c code from f 
i had no idea that syntax existed 
yes the issue was i hadn t done nim c koch in a while it works now thanks 
should just be a static block i believe if i understand you correctly e g of usage  i ll try at some point today build install latest nim manually and see if i can get any different results if i missed something 
why would that be a problem 
yes it works with different converters
no i mean a predict function for example if you want to draw the segmented space http en wikipedia org wiki file k means example step svg 4svg

i ve added a pr here https github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 1345 gael varoquaux gaelvaroquaux i ve checked out the very latest version of the code and the problem is still there so i think my pull request is still valid i ve looked over it now and it seems that the code for precision and recall were recently updated as well as the code for auc but not the implementation of precision recall curve is that right the change i made applies to precision recall curve only i also added a test based on the example above

one important difference is that i didn t know partial fit was for incremental learning so shame on me and thank you for putting me on the right track in my defense the documentation for the method just duplicates the one for fit

oiah i re install the whole python package and it works now maybe there are some mismatch or mistakes when you modify the code just try to re install packages and compile seq dataset pyx before any modification of it 
they are a useful output if you want to present the results to a non technical audience and dont want to explain entropy 
i ve observed this only for the dense case 
hi amuller this is not related to the random seed or the random data it reproduces every time for me regardless to what is plotted or what the data is my original code uses fixed random state and data generation is much more complicated here is a deterministic version of the code

amueller i cannot install 017 because of 5904
indeed the main issue is that given two trees with only min weight fraction leaf and min samples split the two trees grow differently because there are times where n node samples min 2min samples leaf but weighted n node samples is not min weight leaf this is in contrary to the idea that they should give equivalent results in certain cases 
ok i discovered that i had numerous duplicated columns in the matrix without realizing it there were 840 columns but it was really 60 unique columns duplicated unintentionally so i do expect that it was a numerical instability issue seems like the sum over the explained variance ratio still should not exceed 10 but i m no longer having the problem after correctly populating the matrix

hi fayeshine thank you very much for your reply the training time of r and python should be a little long 24 hours or shorter than that in r or in python sorry i could not really remember the exact number there are over 10 thousand different combinations of hyper paramters values btw all r python codes are available at https github com xueyan python xueyan2015python r  fayeshine commented 2 days ago this may need a comparison on the implementation code even the blas library may give different results however can i ask the training time of r and python 
yeah it s a large df hundreds of columns with two dtypes strings and floats the first stage of the pipeline takes care of one hot encoding the strings and then attaches it back to the original df the numpy array that is passed to the last stage of the pipeline is pure float s float64s the pipeline itself seems to be okay as the fit predict and predict proba methods work fine on my input dfs it s only when i pass the pipeline as the estimator argument in rfecv that i get the above error one caveat is that in my custom transformer i haven t implemented get params and set params could this be causing the error

agramfort done any way to have the ci trigger the failure from my fork s branch or does that only happen on the main project branch s p rs prs 
hi please try the following code 
i guess it s the only way to do it note that i have no idea how this mloss org works i was just pointing out the outdated link thanks for responding 
tom dlt tomdlt tguillemot correct me if i m wrong i don t think the following will work 
yes the result is below i forgot to point out that these results are consistent across dozens of runs i never got a value above 060 with train test split and a value below 088 with cross val score this is the processing script 
the ov r ovr method is just to make a stand alone example my real use case is to use one hot labels with neural networks but i wanted to give a simple example using only scikit learn feel free to add a better toy example 
instead of having cross validaton error as a function of training example to have it as a function of number of trees sorry for not specifying this the idea is that the number of trees are an important parameter in a random forrest regresion it is insidefull to be able to see the classification error as a function of the number of trees to see if one needs more trees or needs to preform early stopping to me it seems somehow less important to see the cross validation results as function of the number of training samples since that is not often a hyperparameter i can choose 
my pipeline transform 1transform would be great yes it would probably need examples because 1 is hard to google regarding feature description currently i am using this code https github com mratsim machine learning machinelearning kaggle blob master kaggle titanic 20200012020titanic survivors 20survivors kaggle python 001python magical forest magicalforest py l 526 l526 to get feature description ranking by tree ensembles it walks through all transformations in a pipeline the main issue is inconsistency between one hot encoder onehotencoder active features and label binarizer labelbinarizer classes at least furthermore for n category features label binarizer labelbinarizer return n columns except if there are 2 it returns 1 column only which tripped me and others edit this should probably be discussed in another thread also you probably referenced the wrong issue 2013
the reason why i did one hot encoding first is exactly because of 6967 and the fact that i had na ns nans in both categorical and numeric features it did not occur to me that i can first remove na ns nans in the categorical features then apply the imputer and finally the one hot encoder it s a bit convoluted but it works i might try to submit a pull request myself in the next few days if you think this is easy enough for a beginner in scikit 
i will open a pr with the improvements of the doc i investigated the code a bit more i think that when output distribution uniform the statement l https l2250https github com scikit learn scikit learn blob cd fe sklearn cd8fe16sklearn preprocessing data py l 2250 l2250 is not needed as for a uniform distribution on 0 1 the quantile function ppf is the identity function in this case the implementation would just compute the empirical cdf which would correspond to what i think it should be doing unless there was a reason to use ppf even for the uniform output cc glemaitre ogrisel ps i also had a look at the quantile transformer quantiletransformer pr this is impressive work 
fixed personal experience is that instead of install all required library one by one install them in a bundle such as anaconda is easier 
given that you contributed the most i will let you have the honor 
jnothman i looked back at earlier k means kmeans related issues mdash 596 was the main conversation i found regarding k means kmeans parallelization mdash but couldn t find a previous discussion of avoiding backwards incompatibility issues i definitely understand not wanting to unexpectedly alter users existing k means kmeans code but at the same time getting a different k means kmeans model with the same input random state depending on if it is parallelized or not is unsettling i m not sure what the best practices are here we could modify the k means kmeans implementation to always return the same model regardless of the value of n jobs this option while it would cause a change in existing code behavior sounds pretty reasonable to me or perhaps if the backwards incompatibility issue make it a better option to keep the current implementation we could at least add a note to the k means kmeans api documentation informing users of this discrepancy 
gael varoquaux gaelvaroquaux yup it only occurs with n jobs 1 fixing the errors with the invalid y does not change it however the scoring fixed it had missed that i hadn t updated the scoring jnothman thanks for that this was the issue not entirely sure why this brought out the issue though 
jnothman done thanks for the suggestion i also added the imports etc so it can now simply be copy pasted and run 
nicolas hug nicolashug that only fixes the problem half way setting labels resolves the not enough classes out of fold case but the not enough classes in fold case is still a problem 
the sklearn version is 0191
sure am at work but can tackle it this afternoon will write accompanying test
i stumbled upon it myself with some data but by preprocessing i got the result i needed i was just confused by if it for a while but as mentioned maybe i should look into improving the documentation
my dataset is private besides it weighs several gigabytes furthermore i don t think examining the dataset is going to enlighten you all that much especially as i have recently noticed that changing the hyperparameters can sometimes cause the error to appear on a dataset that previously allowed training with no problem based on jnothman s observation i have added if len terminal region  0 return after line 385 terminal region np where terminal regions leaf 0 of sklearn ensemble gradient boosting py l https l385https github com scikit learn scikit learn blob master sklearn ensemble gradient boosting py l 385 l385 i confirm that with this change i can train the model on my dataset without any errors if i undo the modification then as before model fit throws the above error 
you really do me a big favor thanks qinhanmin 2014 qinhanmin2014
0191 i traced some code in base py on github just today to make sure it matched mine there were subtle differences but the limitation of set params was still there in whichever more recent version i was looking at 
jnothman yes one often wants only certain interactions passing everything from column transformer columntransformer into polynomial features polynomialfeatures can generate a lot of features fist this may blow up memory second a feature selection method like l 1 l1 penalty might be needed which slows down fitting or is not available third sometimes one really only wants some specific interactions based on your suggestion i managed to pass a column transformer columntransformer into a pipeline for column transformer columntransformer like this  there are several issues with this  one has to specify the feature names twice once in cat num and then again in column trans  it generates also interactions of ohe of a which of course results in a column of zeros th 4th column in the result would be nice not to create this in the first place instead of having to call variance threshold variancethreshold afterwards  it would also be nice if polynomial features polynomialfeatures had an option to output only the real interactions like ab ac bc and not a b c ab ac bc despite interaction only true 
jnothman i can only offer a simple fix for this problem since this is a small mistake if i m right maybe you can just accept my patch or take it as a reference 
https gist github com chriskamphuis bd c ec ae ff b bac fc d 41 bd261c02ec79ae045ff8b8bac2fc8d41 the data is actually k 130k lines however i included the first few hunderd i found that when using this data the results do in fact actually differ however using the total dataset it does not the whole dataset is downloaded here https www kaggle com zynicide wine reviews downloads winemag data k 130k v csv v2csv 4
i don t know what it is other than an observation i found the memory leak thread first but then realized it could be more things that s right n jobs 1 does not have an issue 
absolutely not on master however currently i put it in 11950 for now because there was no use elsewhere yet but i can make a separate pr for that it s adapted from some code of loky essentially loop over dynamically shared libs to check which blas openmp is loaded and then use the appropriate method to dynamically set the max number of threads they are allowed to use 
fit sets daal model attributes storing library objects representing solution estimators is a property that constructs the list of sklearn tree decision tree classifier decisiontreeclassifier objects reconstructed from daal model the reconstruction is expensive so i am caching the result in cached estimators the question really is why does predict call estimators property code it turns out this was happening during the call because that explicitly accesses estimators so i suppose i should not be calling this method 
rth sorry i can t download all the dataset it s to large as well as forbidden but i can run code on it for anything you need my code is something like this  i can get the correct answer plz tell me anything you need i will run the code for you thanks very much 
my use case for the repr is pretty niche but i felt a sk set printoptions threshold np inf would be useful generally as i m sure theres other places these thresholds are used say printing an estimator i was working on something similar to tpot where sklearn pipelines are evolved deap the evolutionary package uses eval to recreate objects so the repr is invoked here by default to make a new estimator i have it working with my own pprint function but the reason i wanted this is just so i could get the repr easily for lambdas without redefining pprint i agree in 99 of cases the eval repr combination is not the best approach to recreating objects but in this case its most inline with the existing deap design which has to be able to deal with all types of classes not just sklearn 
aishgrt 1 aishgrt1 all the coding for this issue including comprehensive internal testing is already done in pr 12319 could you please have a look at pr 12319 and comment there i would love to have this finished while i may still remember the details 
ogrisel using my example above with n estimators 20 and varying n jobs it looks like you are correct that x 2x memory is used independent of n jobs that s not too bad actually for some reason i thought it was worse also i can confirm that with threading backend and n jobs 20 the memory increases by only 4 i thought i had checked that earlier but i may have been using an older version of scikit learn sorry for the false alarm 
the problem actually comes from keras not skl my bad please close this issue 
rth it was intended dtype none should preserve the data type and you can t force finite values on an object dtype object also fails i ve updated the example code 
my sklearn version is scikit learn 0191
jnothman not sure i understand your comment multi output classifier multioutputclassifier doesn t have a classes attribute either not a bad idea to add that one as well multi output classifier multioutputclassifier exposes an estimators attribute which is the list of independently fitted estimators so the length of estimators is equal to the number of outputs unfortunately estimators is also used by ensemble estimators e g random forest randomforest and there the length of estimators doesn t correspond to the number of outputs the number of classes is also independent from the number of outputs a multi output classifier might have e g 2 outputs one with 3 classes and one with 7 classes anyway my current workaround is to check whether the estimator has estimators but not n outputs and then i handle it separately but that s clunky 
oh sorry i forgot about this part i have uploaded my sample database here s the link https github com wrdcz lfw p blob master lfw p zip you might have to change the path at line 17 of code i have posted above thanks 
this is my partial code i can not show all my code because it s against company s rules please understand my dataset with 16 million samples and each sample have 150 dimension i can t provide it either the parameter i used in minibatch kmeans are as follows seed 1 batch size 5000 the code 
i cloned the source code from github and build up a scikit learn project locally 6 months ago the project worked untill i updated it to the recent version on github also before i updated the project i had my python numpy scipy matplotlib pandas and joblib all updated to the latest version so i am not sure why i still has this import error 
i dive into the function in fact sklearn decomposition pca uses numpy linalg svd https docs scipy org doc numpy reference 1140reference generated numpy linalg svd html so is not a pca but an svd the data matrix is not standardized so probably is the covariance matrix two years ago i presume i got different results because of the fact that it was an svd so i thought it was thte correlation matrix i don t think it s correct to say that it s a pca when it is in fact an svd i hope some developer will clarify this point because i have to use it for a publication 
as mentioned the issue is on the bit 32bit version only without stratify the method is returning sensible results i e 80000 2 20000 2
i don t see this issue in scikit 022 looks like it got fixed 
i am doing this in order to get the shared components between two views of some data 
hi i m so sorry i m not able to reproduce it
i m currently setting things up locally for contributing a pull request if it s ok for the core dev team i would first look into fixing it by remembering the remainder transformer s columns as column names instead of indices if names are provided this should in principle fix the issue without needing a column order check and we would not have to remember the column order somewhere to check it later 
sure i just wrote down the data shown in the plot the first column is w i p 502 p502 and the second column is m star so you can take log 10 log10 for both of them and then make the plot ignore the condition want i have removed those unwanted points in the txt file thanks for help i truly appreciate it mstar wp txt wp50txt https github com scikit learn scikit learn files mstar 3420037mstar wp txt wp50txt 
i executed it within py charm pycharm using the integrated viewer and in an terminal to save the graphic with plt savefig test png i m using matplotlib 311
yes go ahead i did not have time so far to look at it i am unsure since i have not studied the theory but maybe there is a bigger issue with the nystroem implementation giving n features to nystroem it still produces n features with fit transform only now the features are of a different dimensionality n components i was hoping nystroem would actually only store compute a kernel matrix of n components x n see storage and complexity https en wikipedia org wiki low rank matrix approximations nystr c b m c3b6m approximation in its current state it seems you still reach a n x n kernel matrix which defeats the purpose of using nystroem right for example nystroem should make it possible to do kernel ridge regression with many training examples large n which would typically be very expensive maybe i misunderstand how it is supposed to work the example on scikit learn actually increases the dimensionality of the features from 64 to 300 https scikit learn org stable modules generated sklearn kernel approximation nystroem html sklearn kernel approximation nystroem which seems like a strange example to me the score is improved but this is not an application where memory or complexity is reduced 
jnothman no i have not reported this to spicy but i will within the next 24 hours
i get the same behavior regardless of the parameter i pick all other tree based classifiers i have used work as expected this is the only one producing this bug 
in certain instances some of my classes have zero samples which was causing inconsistent labels it was also convenient to preserve the order after following suggestions online of others who did this https stackoverflow com questions using 28656736using scikits labelencoder correctly across multiple programs i was using the label encoder labelencoder without issue until this specific case i have now changed methods of label encoding 
i ve pip installed joblib 0140 and the error still reproduces though it seems to be somewhat more intermittent if you are trying to reproduce you may need to run the last cell a few times before the error is thrown i ve updated the github repo to use 0140 if you d like to try to reproduce the error yourself 
hello ahmhashesh i ve submitted a pr https github com scikit learn scikit learn pull 15579 for this issue and it would be great if you could review it still do feel free to provide your own implementation as well best regards
thanks jnothman for your answer i think with mwe will be more clear basically i want to use gridsearch cv gridsearchcv for the hyperparameter evaluation of clustering in scikit learn in an automatic way here is a mwe  so to fix that i suggest that silhouette score could return 1 in both extreme cases 
i try to install via pip conda  now working with dev version but in 022 its the same problem
i think the main case is that a matrix of zeros is the confusion matrix in this case confusion matrix  returns a x 0 0x0 array rather than error which seems to be the correct behavior i m a bit unclear of the condition being checked https github com scikit learn scikit learn blob db b c b d a a c f a cb b c sklearn db85b1264c5b0d24a944a9312c4f5a0cb2b033c9sklearn metrics classification py l 279 l279 it seems the condition to check to raise a value error should be something like any y not in labels for y in y true or any y not in labels for y in y pred currently if values appear in y true or y pred but not labels they are silently ignored which violates the expectation of confusion matrix that np sum confusion matrix y true y pred  len y true 
anything goes buy num py numpy arrays are obvious expected result 
so the first and the second column are the problem because everything or nothing is in the class my suggestion is to filter them out and give a userwarning so the roc auc score is still calculated for class 3 and 4 i am currently experimenting with thresholds in my continous ground truth to create one hot vectors and depending on the threshold i run into this error so i need to filter some of my classes out thank you for the help

http jsbin com omirod 43 look at the addressbar after clicking link one going back and clicking link two the address bar is pointing to some page somepage id 1
i haven t had time making a test page but i have been working a bit more on this issue and the difference between the pages is that when the back button is working the page is loaded by a javascript function calling location attr href url and when the back button is not working the page is loaded by a plain a href tag
ok i updated your template with a simple test page let me know if you see the problem you can also see the issue at http imc heroku com debug using ie 8 ie8
it is an iphone 4 with i os ios 5 remember zooming in is not the problem zooming out is if you zoom in on the list itself then try to zoom out it usually takes 23 tries to get it to work to replicate  load the page zoom in on the list so that one or two items take up the screen let go off the zoom in gesture try to zoom out
just add in your css a visited color red  and then a button on your page lt a href http www google com data role button gt google lt a gt press the button and then get back to your page and refresh it 
i refactored a bit to put the html links from the ajax lists into my index html so they re hash links with the latest jqm js and css the fixed header still isn t showing up if i back up when i ve been scrolled down the list a ways as of 5 minutes ago confirmed working on the 10 jqm still 
i don t know if a is bin will work because its a custom build of jqm i did do a little testing and if i add all the main components in the section with core it works so i think its a dependency that is not set i also tried with 11 and got the same error ill try and get something togeather when i m back at a pc on 28 jan 2013 1911 ghislain seguin notifications github com wrote

hi i confirm the output is the same on 10 and 101 in fact in my taphold event i performs a call to the simple dialog 2 simpledialog2 plug in http dev jtsage com j qm jqm simple dialog simpledialog demos 2 demos2 code last selected project lastselectedproject simpledialog 2 simpledialog2 mode  button header text headertext  information button prompt buttonprompt  select an option below for  last selected project lastselectedproject children projects title text  project zindex  99999 buttons   code so my guess is that in 101 the plug in disrupt the event so when taphold is called next event is ignored and with 11 rc 1 rc1 the event is still delivered so i didn t notice the problem before upgrading to jqm 11 is it possible that the plug in disrupt events delivery can you confirm that you can reproduce the problem with simple dialog 2 simpledialog2 about the behaviour i think that is a taphold event is delivered for a component a tap event should be dismissed to prevent such problems no thanks for your help

hmmm to the first comment you d need an image on the server for the header which via phone gap phonegap works for all orientations and devices in theory so there s no size it does have a max size in the css but it s 100 basically otherwise i think it s just really hard to squeeze all my non disclosed plugins css etc into your test page i ve taken a quick try and nothing is working with 172 on that test page all i see is a spinning icon and the footer up top i ve been using a variety of things fluid css like this media only screen and min width px 481px  etc lt link href boilerplate css rel stylesheet type text css gt lt link href css my fluid css css rel stylesheet type text css gt lt link href jquery mobile jquery 110jquery mobile css 110css rel stylesheet type text css gt lt link href css themes private clients stuff privateclientsstuff min css rel stylesheet type text css gt lt if lt ie gt 9gt lt script src html shiv html5shiv googlecode com svn trunk html js html5js gt lt script gt lt endif gt lt script src jquery mobile jquery 110jquery js 172js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src jquery mobile overrides 110overrides js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src jquery mobile jquery 110jquery mobile js 110js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src green sock greensock tween max tweenmax min js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src js utilities utilities js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src js my ad network myadnetwork js 010js type text javascript gt lt script gt lt script src js private client plugin privateclientplugin js 010js type text javascript gt lt script gt well i ll burn an hour or two trying further but i doubt i can help you reproduce this obvious to me and seems like a major bug i d assumed someone in the forum would be well familiar with this problem and a couple of weeks would result in something more again my first impression is headers and footers should only exists once and be static and the content changes it s seems like an after though wasteful as it s duplicated and redundantly hacked for headers footers to work it appears as if they actually disappear after not animating to reveal a duplicate header underneath so it seems static headers and footers is totally being done wrong if it s static there should be only one entry needed i think that s at the root of it s dysfunction cause it clearly doesn t update the content section s top after the image in the duplicate banner loads resizes stomping over the content area 
maurice g mauriceg i updated the issue by using on instead of live same problem on ios works fine in chrome firefox and safari on my mac anywhere means anywhere else than the test div e g the nevermind div the header or footer as well 
u go mobi ugomobi i know that its use may not be the standard but i prefer a controlgroup instead of multiple buttons in the header to make it more compact especially if i have left buttons right buttons and title maybe there should be a common solution to position elements to right or left in the header such as a data something instead of a button related class or maybe renaming the class i m not sure of it anyway your solution seems ok to me

i fixed this by making the entire site ssl so no switching between http and https 
deprecation simply means that the feature will likely be removed in the future you should be able to expect for it to still work correctly in the current version it s unfortunately that api documentation has not been updated for 14 makes it kind of hard to decide what s a bug v s unsupported feature that has not been removed yet btw the workaround for mobile change page changepage is to call pagecontainer change to options on the page container pagecontainer widget if you use the default container you would call mobile page container pagecontainer pagecontainer change to options

i knew you would reply about the test page i will try to come up with something but not sure if it works the same through a web app as it does through a native app in the past i had to turn on hardware acceleration in the android manifest to get decent speed results using parts of jqm unfortunately if it is only native app related a test page will not work to show the issue i am having i will see if can come up with a jsfiddle to see if i experience the same delays do you have a link to a jsfiddle that has jqm 130 rc 1 rc1 to use 
it doesnot work in chrome but works in firefox and safari browser
thanks i think i mean framework you can get an example by copying source code from multiple pages demo eg from 130 beta or rc 1 rc1 demos and changing stylesheet and script link to v 130 v130 changing css back to rc 1 rc1 makes things working
agcolom yes that would be much better thanks closing here re opening there https github com jquery api jquerymobile com issues 114
i tested again against http view jquerymobile com master demos it is still not working i think the underlying issue here is that ie disables all background image color styles in high contrast mode one could change the border color border thickness instead 
well http rails assets org only has version 140 of j query jquery mobile in their components list https rails assets org components so to update it i must add the new version manually via https rails assets org components new but unfortunately the above error occurs 
tested in the android 412 standard browser and mozilla and the assembly phone gap phonegap if quick swipe there is a closure panel however if slow swipe is what is shown in the screenshot 
as you can see in the code i provided the markup is generated not hardcoded i only use and then i use handlebars js ember js to create a button the code worked fine using the previous jqm 
it does also happen with the latest source if i can do anything else to support you finding the error please let me know 
recently on 1 i phone iphone 6 w i os ios 81 2 i pod ipod touch th 5th gen w i os ios 81 i noticed this awhile back on other i os ios devices with older versions of i os ios but can t remember exactly which ones i did not try other i os ios devices recently than mentioned above 
thanks for quick response the result page response from server i m getting is approximately following http jsbin com ofuhaw 1344 the problem is that i have limited access to actual device so now i cannot say for sure also it seems that the main difference with the above code is in j query jquery version could you check does changing jquery min 180min js to jquery min 191min js fixes the bug if yes that is the issue of nu get nuget j query jquery mobile package not j query jquery mobile itself

this happened with cordova as well as non cordova cocoon build not doing anything unusual by inside the archive i just mean that the html file is packaged into the ipa file like any hybrid app i mention cocoon because they also offer a launcher which is a build using same configurations and presumably the same i os ios components but that lets you specify a url on launch to load the html 5 html5 app remotely when run this way the bug does not occur hope that clarifies all needed info should be in my initial description as i think about this it may not be a jqm bug so much as a web view webview bug the links to  should obviously know that they are to the current document the problem is that they are not being treated that way

yes sure sorry for my importunity please 
just tried with 262 also 257 had this issue as i think 
well it would be difficult in general i do a several tasks like saving some fields of a document instance and the problem occurs when removing however i didn t have the bug earlier then the following change i have made from 1 define schema a 2 define schema b having an array of schema a 3 define schema c having an array of schema b to 1 define schema a 2 define schema b 1 b1 having an array of schema a 3 define schema b 2 b2 having an array of i ds ids of schema a then i populate them 4 define schema c having an array of schema b 1 b1 note schema b 1 b1 and b 2 b2 have exactly the same structure except the difference of the definition of the instance of the array to schema a then i define schema a schema b 2 b2 and schema c to have model instances then i have a schema b 2 b2 type fetched and populated document to be pushed into the schema b 1 b1 array of a schema c document finally i do certain manipulations and remove the item from the array its a bit complicated i ll try to create a test case later 
i found out why it didn t work my schema didn t contain the name field i added the field and it worked the reason i didn t discover this earlier was because apparently you can create new documents without the schema being complete 
yeah sure the code i m working on currently is delivering advert playlists to cinemas we get multiple playlist feeds coming in from different upstream sources via multiple cron jobs and then these trigger a job per playlist to actually do the outbound delivery down to individual sites fairly easy no concurrency problems here yet but we also have another cron job that rounds up playlists that need to be removed i e we don t get them from the feeds any more but they re still sitting in the cinemas themselves and this is essentially continually running so might occur in between the read and the write of the scenario listed above slim but i d rather be sure and this job essentially just updates the state of each playlist in this central location strange as it may seem we need 0 items in a playlist because often they ll send down blank playlists as placeholders for individual cinemas to place local advertising in another scenario i ve found this to be a problem is when trying to do a put request with raw form data if the nested list has no items then no key is sent from the form schema example let me know if you need more it s slimmed down syntax may not be 100 the playlist attribute is not actually required in this example to my understanding not sure if there is a way to enforce a min occurs minoccurs max occurs maxoccurs would be useful to know if there is a way however if you supply the full schema without the playlist attr the playlist will remain there because it always does set and not an overwrite 
i create file test js with this contents  node js version is 088 when i install mongoose from git github com learn boost learnboost mongoose master error doesn t reproduce 
mongo 22 mongoose 331 aggregation keeps throwing the above error for every collection not sure where to start looking for details for this
awesome i was looking for this actually in the docs i didn t connect on the word middleware 
yes same behavior in the two previous releases i ve been trying and i keep hoping the next release will fix it 
aheckmann i need a maximum length maxlength validator for string fields in schema each string fields have different maxlengths so i need a common validator for maxlength with length of string need to be passed to validation function so that i can control maxlength of different string fields from common validation function not by writing different validation function for each string fields in schema 
no i ended up getting the entire subdocument and deleting the parts i didn t want to pass on 
because it is an existing distributed project written not only on node js nodejs scheme has already been defined and everything is already running 
node 1022 mongoose 381
my aggregate function is translated from coffeescript  i m just doing a count before the aggregation if this is still not obvious i will create a dedicated code to reproduce more easily the crash 
sorry i try to explain the problem as you can see my schema has one non required field parent in mongoose 3824 if i try to save item like this it works fine  i agree parent is not defiend his value is equals to undefined but normally mongoose ignore this field and don t try to save this value in mongo db mongodb if field is not setted
well i m using the post save as a place to update some related models data based on the last saved values of the parent model i m not really happy with that but the children need the info to be up to date and i thought it d be the safest way to do it so i don t have a strategy of how i want to handle the error that happens in there yet i m just cognizant that there could be one and so the app needs to be alerted to it we might end up retrying or doing a transaction rollback or something not sure yet 
mongoose 388 i tried updating to 3813 but still i get following error
i have a sharded cluster with 2 shards and each shard have 1 primary 1 secondary and 1 arbiter am using mongo db mongodb 305 and mongoose 403 version when secondary instances are down and when i query from mongo shell with read preference readpreference as secondary am getting error message as no good nodes on rs 1 rs1 the same error gets displayed through mongo db mongodb native driver but from mongoose am getting success result hence i doubt if read preference readpreference works or not with mongoose
i use https github com stream utils hash stream to get the buffer then do 
i guess it was because of different versions in mongoose dependency i just can t reproduce it after unlinking and full reinstall 
alabid yes in my case my thing container mythingcontainer things is populated do you mean push is not supposed to work with populated arrays here s my code a building is a specialized group and a residence contains an array of group objects 
not embedded it is a reference when i call populate on a query i get the result i want i just need the same thing without calling a query to the db i am creating models from a cache and need to construct them and populate them manually 
i have updated the schema and still getting errors my schema and code to save now looks like this  so not sure what i m doing wrong and everything seems right any help insight would be appreciated thanks 
hi using mongoose version 3819 unfortunately this trick code user addresses 0 address to object toobject code does not work the error is

that is exactly what i would expect thank you i prefer the way you have it implemented no fields are marked as modified initially it would be handy to have a second parameter which would flip that logic for example my front end code keeps track of dirty fields and posts only those fields to the update service my backend assumes that any fields passed to it are modified and should be persisted to the database i know not all services work this way but it is certainly a use case and would save me and others from looping over all the fields can you give any insight on how validation would work what if i hydrate a document with only modified fields per my use case above will validation fail on non hydrated fields thanks 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 you are right it works out of the box i was in the middle of refactoring while i play with new mongo 30 anyway i knew that you works at mongo db mongodb inc and are a maintainer of mongoose project and node mongodb native mongoose has a dependency of mongodb 20 is it ok to work with mongod 30 is mongoose always going to sync with the latest greatest feature of mongodb 30 and onwards i recently noticed that mongoskin is not being maintained and looking for maintainers i am afraid if i bet too much on mongoose then it happens to be like mongoskin project i am sure that node mongodb native is officially node js driver repo by mongo db mongodb inc but i love the mongoose schema concept 
sorry i mean how i can force mongoose to return errors for unit testing 
i ve replicated the issue with test cases and now fixed in the pull request referenced above pr 2732

it looks like this not sure if it helps  process finished with exit code 8
it appears to be lib error js line 11 where it used arguments callee i m using mongoose 402 node 0124 harmony and use strict is turned on
given  as you can see the error returned by update is only for the first encountered error so you don t get to see that there are other errors that need resolving save on the other hand provides an object containing errors for each property

thanks for the prompt response i am trying to populate location coordinates into each product document by referencing the document note these documents are separate schema files eg  if you notice the location is an empty array even though i referenced the location document is this helpful what i want to be able to do is populate where city is for example plano i want to populate the coordinates in products
yep having the mongoose doc available in result value when raw result rawresult true should cover my use case thanks 
thanks for your reply i can confirm that the document is not being deleted from the database at any stage we have some static configuration schedules in the database to dictate when certain tasks are to be run and when they run we update their last run lastrun timestamp and that s all that happens this happens with a regular save call as per the above moreover we ve had this setup running for more than 2 years now with various tasks but this error only occurs with this one particular task and only started happening in the last month or so without us making any changes to the task so it seems like the problem may lie deeper we are running on mongod version 3611 mma pv 1 mmapv1 at the moment 
yeap i have a model named conversation which is transversal to any model i defined it like this  no more code than this should be relevant 
you re right i upgraded to last version and it works fine now any other potentially dangerous behavior that we should be aware of just want to make sure we are using mongoose in the safest possible way and avoid undesired massive updates removes i appreciate the prompt response

i upgraded today to mongoose v 4110 v4110 to see if this warning was resolved but the same situation was occurring a week or so ago against node v node v400node v 0127 v0127 and mongoose v 3 v3 latest version if it s a warning i assume that the lack of binary bson implementation would impact production performance thanks for looking into this

oops sorry https github com spamguy diplomacy blob master server models season js
it s causing a lot of a trouble java script javascript has no reasonable way of creating an execution context the only existing api that was available in node js was deprecated a while ago the only way to implement transactions in js is to pass along the transaction handle manually which gets incredibly hard in complex systems all methods have to be transaction aware mongoose implemented a nice approach it s possible to associate a transaction with a document instance using doc session handle and it ll automatically use the handle for all doc related queries it allows writing custom schema methods that simply retrieve the current handle using this session and then they pass it along it works nicely but unfortunately breaks for subdocs as described in the first post it s even more confusing when you create a document using mongoose from within transaction its handle is associated with the doc automatically but it s not available from subdocs cc vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 i think you originally added the session helper

yes i was able to execute the same query in monghub actually 
i solved my problem and your suggestion to look at registering models helped me to solve it apparently i was registering a model in an included file prior to attempting to apply the global plugin this prevents the global plugin from being applied i moved the global plugin near the beginning of the app and now the plugin is applied to all models thanks for the help 
answer for st 1st question is unique id s are place id  lat lng nd 2nd question s answer using model save inside an async loop 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 i have been storing an array of document and some of the elements in that array are already present in mongo db mongodb now i want the old one to be replaced and the new one to be inserted just by one command i came across update query with upsert option but not sure if that s the perfect way of achieving that for an array after some search i came to know that drop dups dropdups is deprecated in newer versions so its not working now just let me know if there is any field i can add while creating schema or a command for achieving the same for saving array of documents 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 this is weird your test fails for me using 490 i think i ll have to investigate further 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 i don t think there is any issue here i think what i m remembering is wrong apologies and thanks for the help

you know i ve had such an issue with the aggregate function call and bending it to my will esp with needing to make 2 joins that i think i m going to go a different route and just deal with a lot of stuff in memory and cache it i m reading a textbook on mongo db mongodb hopefully that will increase my skills then i ll come back to this 
npm install mongoose save 459 the same with save dev
sneaking to close issue such dishonor 
yes sir like this  my goal is that any subsequent request to mongo going down will fail immediately
ah sorry forgot to clarify in the text it s only in the subject i am encountering timeouts after a rather short time 1 minute or so 
exactly like in the example that s why i left it out  i will close this since it seems that like it s not reproducible since i cannot post my whole project which is quite big i avoided the problem by not using mongoose create connection createconnection i solved my problem another way with still using mongoose connect 
sorry for the delay  the current behavior is to create the name index for the vendors collection and the vendor name index in the products collection but in our case we do not want the vendor name index in the products collection we do this fairly often embed documents from one collection into another and almost never want the index definitions when embedded so not sure what api makes the most sense to disable this behavior global config at the definition of the embedded document property or on the definition of the embeddable document property index but any of those would work for us does this make sense 
i m using version 103 of mongoose dateonly both dateonly and mongoose dateonly has not been updated in a long time i ve tested to verify the odd incongruities between your results and mine and i ve found that with mongoose 4112 the result is always set on the current day date ignoring the value passed in date of birth dateofbirth for a test i ve set my system date and time in the future august th 24th 2018 and the result for mongoose 4112 was while on mongoose 4111 the result was coherent with the one presented in my previous post in my tests i ve only changed mongoose package version while using the latest for mongoose dateonly 
i m pretty sure it is related to https github com automattic mongoose issues 1987 but i didn t see any mention of it in the release notes as for recreating it i used the code from https github com simonholmes getting mean tree chapter 11 i added the following script to a scripts folder in the project to illustrate the change  result with mongoose 380 deleted created distance e 17453292699914073e 9 result with mongoose 485 deleted created distance 0011131884616932194
was mas my mistake there was something wrong with the code thanks a lot 
the connection is being created using something like this 
yes we define our hooks before calling mongoose model 
here is my schema it is very normal i debugged the code of moongoose moogose put safe null without setting it is there any way to remove this 
i wish i could but unfortunately it seems environment related so i can t even reproduce in local 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 my webpack config ts  that you spoke of still didn t work 
yes i can do that i m already doing something similar actually but i don t know for me a better approach for those cases would be returning an empty user instead of throwing an error this is my currently approach 
sorry i linked to wrong docs here is the updated docs that basically say compile it yourself https mongoosejs com docs browser html
i m using bluebird and i just have ssl true
i am exporting the connections using module exports conn 1 conn1 connection 1 connection1 i am also exporting the mongoose instance using module exports mongoose mongoose then i am using them in my model file as such
i mean stop data migration when starting the server because when the server is started the database has been updated
for some reason i can t reproduce the error i do notice that err and my object myobject are null perhaps an idea if the object can t be found that the err object contains an actual error for example can t find object with id i am used to working with java and empty error objects when there is an error is a wierd thing perhaps it s more normal in the javascript world 
i tried two different methods the strange thing is it doesn t reach that part of the code atempt one var db mongoose connect config db  options  user username pass password  function err  if err  console error could not connect to mongo db mongodb console log chalk red err  atempt two look like  in other words it s not bootstrapping to the authentication methods 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 apologies for missing this we didn t find cursor to be a drop in replacement mainly due to this issue https github com automattic mongoose issues 8039 and the cursor method operates orders of magnitude slower than stream likely because it still appears to load only one single record at a time we are currently running and testing at version 570
i m not using or calling ensure index ensureindex anywhere in my code see below  var mongoose require mongoose mongoose promise require bluebird var fs require fs var uri mongodb user password domain com db name dbname var options ssl optionsssl  read in certs var connection options connectionoptions  specify connection options including options ssl optionsssl mongoose connect uri connection options connectionoptions function err  if err console log err  i also feel that this is a strange behavior may be this has to do with the mongo db mongodb server version i am using mongo db mongodb server version 349
no i mean if you made debug you can see the arrays attached to the mongoose model are mongoose array mongoosearray objects but the arrays inside those mongoose array mongoosearray are simple array objects 
hello my friend i installed version 4139 mongoos that you corrected this item but i did not answer my problem is mentioned in this link https github com automattic mongoose issues 5986 too thank you 
i had no regex setup basically a schema and model thats it when i ran nodemon index js the error illustrated in the picture would come up after deliberating for a while decided to remove line 203204 from semver js file another error message prompted my to take a look at line 232 i removed it and the result was mongoose connection was initiated i no longer have the code as i decided to just use mongoclient instead
import decimal 128 decimal128 from bson ends up as const bson require bson and bson decimal 128 decimal128 i wouldn t say this is a mongoose bug changed the title already what is strange though is the error message claiming that cast to array didn t work 
api is not es 6 es6 friendly code itself is not written in es 6 es6
i was defining it in the schema with the expectation that it would apply it at the collection level example  i have enough information now to continue moving forward thank you for the mongoose connection create collection createcollection tip
its going to be difficult to share our webpack config as its a huge project but i ll see if i can come up with a simplified one that will reproduce this though i suspect its due to the size of the project and resulting source map files that causes this to be such a clear issue so new error is not actually the slow part its the stack calls on the error as the stack is only generated when used because it is an expensive operation so we generally don t have this issue very often because the stack is only needed when there s an actual error in the system where we need to report the stack trace typically no worse than once every few minutes and generally much rarer in production in the case of the save call every mongoose write a new stack trace is getting generated well two actually one for saving and one for original stack originalstack our system does many writes usually a few hundred per second so even in production the extra ms 1020ms adds up really quickly i would guess even if we weren t using webpack there s still the ms 1020ms hit here as a stack trace on a minified file without a source map would be similar to a non webpacked stack trace in terms of this performance hit i do understand the value of having the original stack originalstack for debugging purposes and this is why i suggest a flag as it could be handy for many people to switch this off in production to give faster performance while switching it on in development for easier debugging as for the parallel save error parallelsaveerror this one i m not sure what the solution should be to have a similar purpose to what is intended though i do note at the moment as far as i can tell the error is not actually used anywhere and the saving value is practically ignored but i presume its also a case of handy to know about in development and possible to switch off in prod or at least in prod generate the error when it occurs giving a less useful stack trace but still letting you know it has occurred in prod 
sure i hope this helps though the schema is generated by typegoose 
vkarpov 15 vkarpov15 hello sorry for such late response i figured that out yes its was problem with schema by the way i am wondering why there is no option for not specifying replica set replicaset when connecting to multiple ip addresses like it was in 458 version i am exposing kubernetes cluster and when i specify the replica set replicaset cluster changes the host addresses and everything is being screwed
yes i want to to skip incrementing updated at updatedat for a special update for example case 1 user login action update the updated at updatedat and update other field case 2 user logout action don t update the update at updateat but also update the other field how can i achieve that many thanks

hi mhombach sure given the following schemas 
i am heavily using change streams in the app and the higher the number of collections am watching i will also need to have a high number of pool size https jira mongodb org browse docs 11270
we re using this inside a component in a lambda function like this https github com dotstudio io fi slseed api blob master service components database js https github com dotstudio io fi slseed api blob master service functions users index js l 15 l15 then when running tests the unexpected behavior happens after calling mongoose disconnect directly inside a mocha after function 
here you go 
i m afraid not my local mongo db mongodb has been misbehaving which is why i saw the exception in the first place you would need a db with socket timeouts in order to repro i don t have any code executing just an idle connection 
schema looks like this but the bug only happened for specific documents 800 count query result
in my controllers i am updating the data using the fin by id and update finbyidandupdate  i am giving option overwrite true so that if i don t pass any field object or array it should become empty instead of taking previous values so if i pass overwrite true in options it is overwriting both created at and modified at instead of updating only modified at

of course it s a major security issue for my use case i receive the info used to create the document from user input so a hacker could screw the database by manually supplying the ids it s easy to validate this but it doesn t make sense to be able to modify something that is automatically generated i assumed that it works like sql auto increment and would just ignore the supplied id it only makes sense to accept the field when i explicitly add it to the schema i hope that you revise this and only allow modifying the id if it s included in the schema just like other fields 
no

gadamiak submitted giving a second thought on this i agree that behavior requested should not rely on container setting the better way is to rely on the alias setting which would make it consistent with other resource types mod web link modweblink should use its alias like other resource types while it s ignored thus in example above the news weblink should present alias content for the url or the target s when alias is empty combined with the current container setting it will give full control on the url behavior 
pyrographics submitted i set up a new content type for jpg images and added that content type as the form customization default value just to note the manager correctly replaces the normal value html when you switch to the page settings tab before creating the resource but if you just save the resource without first switching tabs it does not

sure but it doesn t matter what header is set just do a post to somewhere using an array as json content you ll see that e g the content type header application json set by the prepare payload preparepayload method gets cleared by prepare headers prepareheaders it simply creates sets a new array instead of adding its headers that leads to a default form related content type which is send to the server which isn t correct

jonleverrier in the screenshot you posted you can click on the image in the upper right of the sidebar and it will show a popup image preview at full size of the image i m thinking a double click would just open the same popup further that popup shows the full image but has scroll bars maybe a slightly improved image preview popup is in order like a full size lightbox for example double click needs some kind of behavior i mean it is actually doing something now it goes to this blank page maybe in the past this had a different behavior why the blank page regardless using the same popup as the sidebar is an easy button fix perhaps

hi mark just for clarification there is an orthographic agreement for all countries with portuguese as primary native language that is implemented for several years now the objective of this agreement is to have all countries writing on the same way so i believe that there is little sense to talk about portuguese from portugal or portuguese from brazil or angola or mozambique etc please consider changing this to portuguese only i am also willing to help with this translation portuguese is my native language so this portuguese translation will be the same for pt pt and pt br lexicons i will try to be as generic as possible trying to avoid expressions that can be typically from portugal as there are some relevant semantic differences from portugal and brazil as an example but i can check and continue the portuguese translation that is already visible in croudin thanks

ok so if i do ipape get options colors in a straight ipython shell it gives the right answers then i instrumented ipdb to print the same info and it always gave linux then i saw the following lines in ipdb init py  by commenting out the the last line the correct info is obtained by ipdb presumably a new ipython shell with default options is created by the ip shell ipshell statement why would ipdb do this a quick smoke test seems to indicate that ipdb works ok without it p s the ipdb file i have matches this one https github com gotcha ipdb blob master ipdb init py

mac os macos 1084 python latest developer i python ipython version with python 332 and  let me know what other information i can provide

i would like to get some information about each engine on startup and store it in mongo db mongodb for later use engine id hostname arch os proctype nbits procspeed ncpus ncpucores memory load address pools depending on these information i can give tasks to specific engines when i try to get these information via dview while long running tasks are already running my client is blocked gets a timeout that s why i would like to get that information first before allowing the controller to give tasks to the engine i will try out your hint but i guess that the engine isn t registered at the time excuting startup script startup command which would mean that the engine id is unknown 
sorry for the long delay i m now using your mergekernel branch but i can still reproduce this problem an aborted task still seems to stick to the engine and can t be resubmitted because the hub thinks it s still inflight

indeed those lines are just redundant and removing the sys stdout assignment in init seems to fix everything it makes debugging possible and also fixes the original issue of output not printed i suppose you only cannot put print debug statements inside the inner part of process input line but that is already the case right now thanks for looking at it will do a pr for that

i was more shocked that i get an error using a method that was on offer this is an interesting expectation change on my end over the years 10 years ago i would totally expect that the user has to know when how to use a method but this days with dynamic object manipulation depending on contents i m kinda expecting that a method on offer doesn t bark at me merely for using it but instead friendly lets me know that it s of no use to me though i see that a thrown error can be much more useful in a bigger application maybe my opinion on this is skewed from too much interactive working you could always return a dict of lists with the lists having only 1 element there are several packages out there that follow that paradigm well i m not sure what i meant either with tuples  i think i just cannot think in terms of actually being interested in the engine number when i was not interested in what goes where in the first place having used a load balanced view that even does not give me that control so maybe one should rather question the existence of the method like this in a result object coming from a lbview

it s definitely possible that my use case is strange or i m not handling it in the best way basically i have an open shift openshift app which is is kind of like a vm with an apache web server listening on 80 apache routes 80 to 8080 where i have nginx listening i would have just put nginx on 80 but the global apache is an open shift openshift requirement next nginx is set as a reverse proxy to send ipython requests to the ipython backend and cloud 9 cloud9 requests to the cloud 9 cloud9 backend both i python ipython and cloud 9 cloud9 use websockets so i don t believe i can run both on port 8000 is this correct cloud 9 cloud9 has a config parameter that allows one to set the port it uses for web socket connections but not the full host url for i python ipython i had to modify the source code as mentioned above everything works the way i have it set up but it s not good to hack the source here s a chat log from someone in the past who had a similar problem http logs nodejs org openshift 20130326 search for user zemanel it seems like the crux of the issue is that open shift openshift only supports websockets on specific ports

this is markdown instead of latex so that s one difference that could be used output markdown rendered html is unique to this case where as just output latex is on the output of math ignoring attributes they both share but really even for math the output does an irritating jump from middle to left of the screen i think the math should be inline style x in markdown vs display style x if it is intended to be left aligned as an output or it should be able to change the the math jax mathjax html output div class math jax mathjax display style text align center which is causing the jump and forcing the important rule

just have elasticsearch http with a dns host parameter that either can t resolve or say you change dns to something else it kills logstash but what if you had multiple outputs getting error is good about can t resolve hostname but to stop logstash might not be the best error handling for this output 
perhaps my thinking is just incorrect i wanted to see how the system would behave if we fell behind in indexing the setup is syslog traps etc ls no filtering  rabbit mq rabbitmq ls filters  es we have multiple indexers pulling from rabbit mq rabbitmq and i ve been trying to expirement with load performance tuning to make a long story short i found the no ack true setting on rabbit mq rabbitmq input to considerably improve performance with no ack false getting above sec 1500sec or so in this setup was difficult with no ack true i was seeing k 78k sec without missing a beat queue remained empty however i was concerned that i never saw the queue in rabbit mq rabbitmq fill up so i wanted to confirm that if indexing fell behind the mq would fill up and things wouldn t just fall over atleast with no ack false i would see the mq fill up during heavy load and we d eventually recover i was trying to confirm if no ack just had that high of a throughput or if something was wrong where ls would crash instead of messages backing up it seems to be the latter  my understanding is if filter workers backed up that ls should stop receiving input thus the mq should begin filling correct what i observed was kibana showing me getting farther and farther behind vs current time meanwhile the mq showing 0 in it s queue eventually the above oom happened and the mq began filling unfortunately the workers never recovered since i am using no ack true all messages in logstash not yet processed multiple hundred thousand are lost forever i tested this with a gb 2gb and gb 8gb on a jvm in both cases ls consumed every possible message from rabbit mq rabbitmq until it reached a critical point where it no longer received messages nor processed what it had already slurped up perhaps the issue is ls will do this behaviour and thus oom instead of stopping consumption of events 
bin logstash is part of the source package distribution of logstash correct therefore if i were to use a chef cookbook i cannot override some sort of attribute or etc file to set java opts more specifically our java opts are prepended to your java opts meaning that if we wanted to turn off some option there is no way for us to do that in other words i do not want to be touching a package file to override java opts 
because logstash collectd with encryption  graphite without encryption but with firewalls
andrewvc makes sense thanks 
having to add a new source each time is kind of a time wasting for users with corporate proxies you have either to handle the authentication for only those url or indeed upload the file manually on the internal binaries server the url format is different from the others sometimes there won t even be an associated hash with each binaries and so on speaking about the general case here didn t check yours yet my point is those central servers are so much used that i can t why an oss project wouldn t push his releases there it s only some hours maximum work but would definitely be useful for many a user le lun 27 oct 2014 2252 jordan sissel notifications github com a crit

untergeek appreciate the response the use case is simple enough we have hundreds of globally distributed cisco palo alto f 5 f5 and other appliances writing their syslog output to a centralized solaris syslog server that merges them all to a single file we are trying to use logstash to read the syslog file and forward the results to elasticsearch for better reporting visualization for elasticsearch kibana to be of more value we are trying to do some intelligent interpretation of the syslog records for selected records we want to add more parsing intelligence e g picking out a client ip we d hope that filter grok match statements would provide that ability for the large variety of records we have we are struggling to find enough complete examples and best practices recommendations to construct an effective conf file the most crude minimally effective filter specification we have working is below    this works but does only the bare minimum we need more filter grok match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog  overwrite  host  date match  timestamp mmm d hh mm ss mmm dd hh mm ss  locale en timezone us eastern remove field  timestamp path pid  msgtext  we need to extend this greatly i am trying to find some guidance on how to cascade multiple grok patterns for example since the grok match statement is a list i would expect syntax much like the date match statement i tried to have tried all the following with no success    none of these seem to work to extend to multiple patterns match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog ip client ip clientip syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog   match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog ip client ip clientip message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog   match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog ip client ip clientip  match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog   what i think we got to work is the following but it just seems wrong    is this really the recommended way to cascade patterns grok match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog ip client ip clientip  overwrite  host  grok match  message syslogtimestamp timestamp iporhost host syslogprog  overwrite  host  
i guess for me i d expected how to configure logstash to send this monitoring data to kibana to be in the logstash docs i looked in the kibana docs as well tbh after i couldn t find it looking in the x pack docs to find the details was the last thing i thought to do but that s the way my brain works i want to configure logstash to show up in the monitoring tab in kibana so i should consult the logstash docs to find out how to do this i m not suggesting moving or duplicating the details in the x pack docs but maybe just a link with some text like looking to configure logstash with x pack monitoring go here to find out how or something would be useful

yes i have multiple input sources which name the hostname field differently and i want to align them to one field as i mentioned this worked in version 153 the renaming part works in both 153 and 154 but the lowercase that follows part empties the hostname field this is the section that breaks if i uncomment the lowercase filter  i can t put the full file here in public but i could email it to you if you contact me at my first and lastname at lexmark com 
thanks colinsurprenant using your debugging steps i managed to pinpoint the issue turns out my date block was duplicated in the logstash config one per filter block after removing the duplicate it s processing the timestamp correctly afaict with test data will try the newly crafted config on a dev instance and will let you know if there s additional issues down the pipeline 
purbon i agree idempotent updates are important and i think the version flag should solve it if we resolve the conflicts within the update operation update or uninstall dependent plugins the current way to install a specific version of a plugin is to uninstall all plugins that depend on it first then uninstall the actual plugin and reinstall it with install version uninstall command user feedback is another item success and failure reasons why should be clearly displayed and i m 1 on more feedback here

hi although conf is huge here is relevant to the above template used is the default with logstash dns filter  the geoip ip and geoip location are the only one which are causing conflict i have even tried disabling one of the custom geo fields for transaction thinking it might be causing conflict but it does not default index logstash is in place so default template should pick up help would be appreciated vik
seems that 21 does not terminate in this case i actually prefer the x 1x behavior since it s much easier to detect that a process went away with an error than detecting errors in log messages but i can see the reasons not to maybe terminating after a certain number of errors would be an option but that s not what this issue is about

so when you run plugin pack do all the dependencies get in to the tarball thats created try this install logstash output webhdfs or logstash output s 3 s3 while on a host that has internet  create the pack plugin pack untar the pack and look for those plugins and those plugin dependencies next on the offline box copy the plugin pack tar gz file over and install the pack plugin unpack pack tar gz then try a plugin install local logstash output s 3 s3 or webhdfs

untergeek control did return back to the console bimalm thanks i had other messages in the logstash plain log which were burying the errors is the previous functionality available to be set via the config where if there is an error in the config it is displayed to the console rather than the log file this would allow the issue to be presented in one location versus needing to check in another spot

hi jsvd i am able to resolve this issues by following this link https www elastic co blog logstash lessons handling duplicates thank you 
thanks 
just to clarify plugins trying to do work on empty batches is the symptom not the actual problem what i observe is logstash doing work on empty event batches passing them through the pipeline including any filter plugins this is a waste of resources and that is in my opinion a problem for a completely idle pipeline https github com praseodym logstash filter multitest blob b ae d e cb b bbd e f pipeline 65b6905ae6d9683e8cb1b66bbd00e39f08579082pipeline http conf i see 100300 multi filter invocations per second with logstash 563 consuming 540 of a cpu core doing exactly nothing

hi unfortunately that didn t work i ve looked at the ruby template for the logstash config and it appears that the module s listener is only instructing the netflow codec to handle v 5 v5 and v 9 v9 flow records i guess this is more of a feature request than a bug 
i am using 613
getting same error i am not sure whether this issue with elasticsearch logstash outputplugin or with my configuration i tried with truststore configuration getting same error please help me on this 
no problem thanks for working on it we re hoping it solves some of our memory gc thrashing issues not having to convert to from ruby strings rubystrings etc when calling our java based input receiver that causes connections to time out ssl clients to die and a lot of other weirdness my thinking was around being able to use the streaming api of jackson i believe codecs also return a map string object to avoid the extra map allocation that gets dropped when it gets converted to an event for the rest of the pipeline there s also usecases like i described in 10350 with codecs that define format s that if they want to follow the same api contract when converted to java plugins will need to allocate temp event objects to use sprintf

i was thinking a gui option in bitcoin qt does datadir need to be specified with every run of the program or does the setting get saved somewhere 
i m talking about the official 06 rc 4 rc4 build can you point me to the code or the reg file that is used by the installer version for creating the protocol handler it could well be that my manual aproach see above is not perfect as i took a mozilla how to as information source

i m not very happy with the notify options i thought that you could access the ws mechanism by the same authority and add a path or scheme urn of ws for example  i think the best way to implement ws support would be to use the notify options as a fundament and build the ws as a layer on top of it what do you think

jmcorgan the main point where i think the c wrapper improves readability and robustness is through type safety and raii instead of passing around void for the zmq context and socket you have a typed object e g zmq socket t and instead of manually calling an initialiser and a destructor for it this is done by the language including a guarantee that the destructor is called which might be forgotten when using the pure c api especially with things like multiple returns in a function or exceptions if there is no longer a big reason not to depend on the c wrapper then i can simply prepare a pr that changes to it and then we can judge based on that how much it simplifies the code or not 
that s a clean build of open ssl openssl against which bitcoin is linked it doesn t appear to be relevant from further testing it looks like some sort of bizarre race condition in the boost test framework itself if i pass catch system errors no which is supposed to make it dump core on a segfault then the test passes without it when this defaults to yes i get the segfault and core dump a more verbose run is  since this is probably a bug in boost rather than in bitcoin and i have a workaround available i don t really expect any further action but i m presenting it here just in case it is a bug in the bitcoin tests and that isn t obvious to me for some reason

mesh collider meshcollider thanks for your fast reply actually i am a student and new at cryptocurrency development beepmagnet is just a cryptocoin which i took to learn for making a window wallet like exe if i am going to build some other cryptocoin likewise in bitcoin also then also i face same problem so can you help me please to find out a way to short out this kind of leveldb problem 
thank you for your comment i will try recompile the source codes it seems that berkeley db wasn t available 
jonasschnelli at least a shared object i could do direct commands instead build a url in java for example and don t need to always wait updates from who build java prc commands make forks to update or just look to another one in git hub you can use the same base in bitcoin cli but just make a sharedobject where can return commands in string json well you know what you could do i just came here with a suggestion 
point taken but i am running bitcoind and can edit the conf file some other threads such as the one below lead me to believe changing the dbcache level might help however the strange part is it is only crashing upon reaching 100 sync when memory usage should be much lower https github com bitcoin bitcoin issues 14345
thanks a lot i was running with gui but now after following that excellent guide headless setup is working great 
the syntax you propose works but i don t think it should crash with invalid syntax it would make sense to default to tcp since it is arguably more popular than named pipes on fri 18 oct 2019 0412 wladimir j van der laan  notifications github com wrote 
sure let me build valgrind and then run the command 
if is space it s work but not when is hardspace nbsp it s look like should be space always before mail maybe except html tags 
hmm problem is when i work with oracle driver https bitbucket org gregnuj cakephp x 2x oracle datasource git with my a little modification to work with 28 when line 371 show error my data look like this stack  my relation is product habtm product category productcategory i thinks the line 371 should look like if is string assoc data assocdata  empty assoc data assocdata  isset data assoc data assocdata  isset data assoc data assocdata insert key insertkey 
unfortunately but my solutions is to remove fieds array from find and it s usually helps 
because i use some plugin for example cake dc cakedc users i would like using custom function finder but i must use users table userstable from plugin but i can t rewrite find auth findauth i think it s shoud be very easy to use this by add something code like below between 168 and 169 line in base authenticate baseauthenticate https api cakephp org source 35source class cake auth base authenticate baseauthenticate html 168169 but dereuromark well noted it s will be to hard to test 
markstory i think the client should use the content length if set in the response header to determine the end of the message body 
this happened to me when i pulled data out of the db and passed some field values to the first argument happened to be null the db allows null values as defaults so it s not a matter of throwing notices and fixing my code this only came to light because of a null value in my db i know about the array signature and that s what i switched to but a null first argument still shouldn t negate the rest of the replacements if the value is null i d expect the respective s to be replaced with an empty string from a api standpoint i d rather be forced to use the array signature and be sure it s safe than having to test and fix my first argument before passing it to 
yeah probably but it is basically due to the new travis issues around https travis ci org cakephp cakephp builds 31619305 thus i opened the ticket here 
if it cannot be handled by our test case testcase wrapper or by switching to a non erroring closure handling then we might have to 
auth sandbox auth sandbox vs expected auth sandbox auth sandbox same with all actions appended and with prefixing admin auth sandbox auth sandbox vs expected admin auth sandbox auth sandbox 
how would the dispatcher interaction work for the controller and view we mainly need read access 
because those do not exist in that application those are the plugins of the target application the param name plugin itself does not warrant force loading plugins as in some scopes this is used for sth else in this case only for path building 
p rs prs for both fix master 38 and enhancement next 3next 39 are open 
sounds both good at a first glance not sure though if prepending only might cause trouble in some situations 
i m not quite sure i guess ideally the signature wouldn t change too much maybe this could be split into two methods like decimal and localized decimal localizeddecimal similarily to time and localized time localizedtime so then in case it is deemed useful it would be just a matter of fitting the optional places requirement in maybe that could be a fourth argument which however might not be overly nice given that passing null or true already determine things kinda similar maybe a polymorphic signature could work where regex accepts a boolean which determines whether the check should be strict or relaxed alternatively passing the places as array might even be an option too something along the lines of 2 validation relaxed which i m not really a fan of though 
i m not quite sure and i don t know what exactly you mean by explicit help but it has the bake a complete mvc skeleton message defined as help so maybe it should either display the same as if it had an empty options parser attached ie like this  which would then require to attach common options to such commands or they could be automatically inherited unless a custom options parser is defined or that the parents help should be displayed but also with the parents usage syntax ie cake bake subcommand options instead of cake bake all subcommand options and people would need to explicitly attach an options parser to the subcommand even if it s just an empty parser i m not really sure what might be the best solution here 
use join model alias as key like in cake 20 instead of join data joindata in 40 or save join model alias inside of join data joindata after feetching from db and check that alias inside belongs to many belongstomany save links savelinks 
lorenzo unfortunately no i can work with svn only dont know yet how develop new features for cake 3 and how to test it with unit tests
i noticed this bug when i was developing another application and this happened even with my controller baked i created the above situation only to try to reproduce and be assured that none of my coding was responsible so i don t think scaffolding is the issue here a work around i found was to force set datasource setdatasource in my controller so i could code 
lorenzo because i can construct something like this  i hope you get it and in article single ctp i can define css file that has styles only for this part of layout so if it is not used page won t download unnecesary styles but without once option the css file is included many times one more there must be something additional to do because with this modification in html code lt link gt html tag htmltag has once attribute 
thanks problem was not the fixture written in error message but the old fixture left in plugin dir though there was glitch related to unique key upgrade shell generates resolved by upgrading old one as below and removing unnecessary constraints  probably it s better to fix or remove misleading path in error message 
it s yours and my point itsn t that an exception may be thrown it s if it happens a fatal error will be thrown instead with maximum nesting alert 
try setting exception handler to null in order to use php s default behavior 
yes but thats better performance wise than the first model with cache sources cachesources false causing that flag to get set for every model the downside to always honoring the model cache sources cachesources is that you can t set the data source datasource cache sources cachesources to false by default and have that honored across the board when using models where some have it on and some have it off but even if the last model leaves it off the next model that tries to do a query will already be configured with its schema info so it would not be calling set source setsource again until the next request i m still searching for a downside to this but besides the inability to have data source datasource cache sources cachesources false by default but so far i haven t found any 
i added a pull request
well i m trying to create a tutorial blogs cakephp 30 from example in the book and just do not even like to modify the configuration of the x app php to modify parameters we apologize for any inconvenience caused  
i ve never heard of that project before but none the less i just pulled that project in and added that number to the phone test case and it failed there too as i mentioned i m still using cake x 2x so i used localized 270
it does work in other operations https github com cakephp cakephp blob x 2x lib cake test case model datasource database mysql test mysqltest php l 2503 l2503
it should but i have come up with a better approach that s likely to perform better when using ap cu apcu or apc 311  apc iterator apciterator is supported in all versions of ap cu apcu and apc 311
rchavik because i try to use app skeleton and composer like for cake php cakephp 30 or croogo 16 a dmad admad i use partially tweaked cake php cakephp for some reasons and i want override some default classes from cake core i think that is not hard to implement my code because it not have any serious changes but gives some flexibiblity for cake x 2x p s sorry for my bad english
then this is obsolete 
for instance if you have multiple flags and want to get only a certain set of results while it seems internally it could be handled with a and not b or b and not a  no support on sq lite sqlite and sql server sqlserver closing 
lorenzo that s a good idea while writing this ticket i also thought about differentiating before save beforesave and after save aftersave more into  update each updateeach and delete each deleteeach would then always trigger any callbacks whereas update all updateall and delete all deleteall would not

hey markstory yep src controller admin users controller userscontroller php exists i assume you mean run 
tried that and the same issue occurs  think something strange is going on in github the issue disappeared and is back now you can ignore the new issue i just created 
thanks people i ve got composer to work it turns out that i ve to add some suffix to the composer update command  thanks 
sorry for your time i just notice that it was actually my mistake i was loading component on the fly in one action only and this happened on another one 
markstory yes thus this issue is not directly related to the search plugin for me the whole query string is being removed via links generated by paginatior helper paginatiorhelper sort the only thing keeping are paginator related query string params i did disable all search plugin things prg component model behavior and ran this  thus the scoped part of the query string is discarded and only the parts relevant to the paginator are being kept by paginator helper paginatorhelper whereas for the unscoped parts and those set to another scope prefix there is no such issue

i don t have the default connection defined as i copied the config from cakephp app bootstrap file i found that if i don t define the connection as test i got an error saying that the default datasource configuration was missing this was the only way i found to sidestep that error confusingly my fixture class extends the default fixtures which define the connection as test https github com cakephp cakephp blob master src test suite testsuite fixture test fixture testfixture php l l 39 l34l39

markstory i commented in your commit https github com cakephp cakephp commit dbeeaa fa e eb a b f fd 69003 9dbeeaa1fa9e23042192eb1a033b526f4fd69003
by lower level database api you mean bypassing cake completely 
yeah i tried that one as well no permutation of using both either of these seems to work  edit also the docs say that if cookie timeout cookietimeout isn t there it ll use the value of timeout for it 
markstory because i was curious i ran it without params in root of git repository
i have not created one so it just uses the default https github com cakephp cakephp blob src 30src orm behavior php l l 129 l127l129 edit exception is being thrown here https github com cakephp cakephp blob src 30src orm behavior registry behaviorregistry php l 143 l143
thanks for reply after login i didn t find auth user id that means not getting value from auth variable 
i mean when i put url mydomain com app its not working but when i put mydomain com app user login its working 
array access arrayaccess should work in my case my json object jsonobject class is intended to be used with cake utility hash get and cake utility hash extract 
i ll try implementing it i just saw http stackoverflow com a 16771200 that listagg is only available from g 11g onwards in oracle should we check the version and throw an exception if not availabe or should we ignore this there seems to be no real fallback 
i wan t the input type checkbox to be disabled but not the input type hidden so that the users see a disabled checkbox but the value is posted nevertheless 
i consider cells something similar to elements with its own logic witch by the way are really great i guess nonexistent cell methods should be threaten like non existend element files people get used to that imo
in entity traint entitytraint is errors method which can get nested errors by nested errors nestederrors field method but ony one level method nested errors nestederrors field can t split field name for now post errors user file filename may be not always correct because post model can has many users user model can has many files then should be possible to get errors somethings like post errors users files 0files filename 0filename also there should be method which can get all available errors if they are i personally create own entity method all errors allerrors which get all errors recursively from entity fields and related entities 
only entry config time is refreshed unfortunately cookie expiration time doesn t may application should set cookie expiration to some much bigger value than session timeout method timed out timedout anyhow keeps seesion fresh outdated 
sql query before cake update 
sure i can it s nothing special i merely mocked this together for testing 
yes of course it s pretty simple what i want to do i have a checkbox change password if it is not checked then the fields old password new password shouldn t be validated or saved in before validate beforevalidate callback i did the following  now i need an alternative for this behavior
in the data array there are a lot of articles and every article has many article items every article item has one store id i want to get all store id s of all article items in a simple way but i found a pretty good solution i think 
no it isn t sig serv sigserv terminates the process i tried re instantiating via helper but that breaks the entire function actually it goes in a forever loop which tells us that it is php bug this session flash returns this view element flash element tmp vars tmpvars options which loads the file and returns but whilst loading it again executes this session flash and it goes around on forever loop stacktrace gives nothing 
you are completely right
yes here they are  but testing with these associations commented out just has the same problem i checked belongs to many belongstomany junction with some debug echoes and all is setting up correctly the join table jointable contains gets its two associations and the correct foreign key foreignkey contained article id for its has many hasmany assoc child articles childarticles belongs to many belongstomany attach to attachto isn t even called 
sorry i was to dumb to rtfm the conditions option of has one hasone should be a simple array of where clauses and no function i think i grabbed the function syntax from an answer from stackoverflow so in this particular example contain simply returned the correct value from the database without even using my where clause because of this the matching call couldn t know about it either when defining the clause in the correct way in the table all works without redefining the condition in the matching call 
interesting i tried it and i got an error function expression functionexpression could not be converted to string but now when i try it again it works smile i surely did somethig wrong and i was looking on the description of query expression queryexpression gt and it says that field should be type of string so i assumed it work s only for database columns anyway the first thing with aliases is still good thing to have so i don t need to write that function twice or use any additional global variable for that but it is not a must since the query where function exp query works 1 so it is low priority i guess not related to this topic maybe the better thing would be distinct on also for ms sql i saw it is not supported yet and it is not that easy to do but it would be good for  join  where  distinct speaking of join it would also be helpful if i could use join model  which would automatically join associated belongs to belongsto table and maybe join model  left  could specify the join method but i m not sure if it s wise to create another issue for that i already feel bad for creating that many issues confused 
mmm i didn t understand the meaning of maybe existent query maybeexistentquery but by entering the iteration because of the if statement returning true it makes an unnecessary select to the database  that results potentially in a lot of entities 
so i have ihave the controller s function display expecting an array encoded with json  the array matches is the one who shall b eused as input argument of the controller

hi markstory i already found the problem create a soft delete and that s why the count and is unique isunique fails the weird thing was that it does not generate me sql log ready close the fake fix 
no the link is compared if the active class activeclass option is set 
here is the error in articles table articlestable php problem solved 
a dmad admad do you mean why php auth user is not php auth user  1 hm i ll test it tomorrow 
sorry this is cakephp 3 recreate by putting a record in a db make a relationship using hasone and then enter create another record that will conflict with the hasone permission this will fail but produce no error on the save function on 20 oct 2014 1852 mark story notifications github com wrote 
dereuromark my bootstrap https github com mirko pagliai cakephp thumber blob master tests bootstrap php already contains that later i will post the complete stacktrace
working on it i posted here to make sure my way is the intended one 
hey mark 
for sure i hit enter by default but nowheres go bake https cloud githubusercontent com assets b a efb f e aee 83726005566922b3a4efb08f3711e49aee c a db a jpg c6a05db983a0jpg i tried different versions of cakephp
i think only first one is better for ux ui i m not an ux expert or it can invalidate all inputs as a default like all plural association name prefixed inputs or all n id suffixed inputs  rules checker error field errorfield option can be used to overwrite like indicating plural association name to invalidate all fields plural association name id 1id to invalidate only nd 2nd one 
why find count need to callback to method after find afterfind it means nothing there 
i can try my idea is to initialize an intl date formatter intldateformatter object using the current locale extract his pattern and with some regex replace the symbols with cake template placeholders this should be done in form helper formhelper construct and only if i n i18n is in use correct me if i m wrong
at the end which is the cause 
my layout default ctp includes a call to this element member navbar which loads a header to the page after updgrading to 333 from 3212 this element wasn t being loaded nor were any of the stylesheets or scripts included in the default ctp layout when i explicitly called this view builder viewbuilder layout default in the controller methods the layout was included apparently no layout at all is getting loaded just the view template for the method note this is only happening in view templates that load an element 
probably shoud be enough calling a method inside the mailer action like this abort sending abortsending or simply returning false intercept that in the send method of cake mailer mailer class like this public function send action args  headers  try if method exists this action  throw new missing action exception missingactionexception mailer  this get name getname  mailer action  action  this email set headers setheaders headers if this email view builder viewbuilder get template gettemplate  this email view builder viewbuilder set template settemplate action  this action args if this is sending aborted issendingaborted  return true  result this email send  finally this reset  return result 
found where was problem i uses for apps cake core include path to point cakephp version in my app config core php configure write debug 0 in my app config bootstrap php configure write debug 1 when i changed in core php debug to 1 when problem fixed maybe it is not issue but in previews cakephp version upgrades i did not had such situations 
yes there is a file model in the application i was completely unaware of that i ll start renaming it i assume it will solve this problem 
i hadn t considered that in fact i don t think i ve ever instantiated an entity without using the table ie this articles new entity newentity only once so far to be honest parsing the results that a very basic search controller searchcontroller passes to the the view depending on the context of what was requested different tables are loaded and a view variable viewvariable results is passed down to format the results i wanted to generate ur ls urls and use each one s display field displayfield as the anchor text of the url for some of them it s the name property for others it s id and for others it might be say username so when iterating disparate entities in the results i thought it would be handy if i could just do this html link entity display field displayfield   or something like that does that make sense 
markstory blo bs blobs don t always contain binary data smile  i don t always control the database just providing a simple api layer to somebody else s database i expected cake php cakephp to just work and it did most of the way i didn t find this particular issue documented anywhere and it took quite a bit of time to figure out why things were breaking i think it should either be fixed or documented somewhere 
nothing fancy ie this gives me same result

hi update on the problem it seems i made a mistake in routes php file for added the resources i had put the setresources for each of the controllers in the wrong place or so it seems 
is this what you mean 
it s a plugin so here s my table code 
i have latest version available though composer 302
markstory it s friends are in there ajax json and xml j query jquery allow you to send xml json script or html they treat it as an equal feels like it s missing i m hoping other people feel the same way a dmad admad it s used in many frameworks and i ve seen this technique used in cake and blogged about since 13 you are both right that cake makes what i m doing pretty darn easy and maybe it s just me d
alright created the pull request 
yes but my solution has three foreach loops nested not the nicest one 
in bootstrap php i have defined 
i didn t even opened the config folder i just installed the cake php cakephp 3 from the composer and that was it my bootstrap php is exactly like that 
no this do not work i have made this little modification in lib cake utility inflector php 389  that do the job hope that help
yes you could reproduce this by requesting any action that requires authentication with ajax and no ajax login ajaxlogin configured in auth component authcomponent i tried writing a test for this but couldn t work out how to simulate the ajax request 
yeah that makes a lot more sense touches far less things shall i submit a pull request 
no technically no form was created the javascript is just serializing all the inputs i ve dynamically created that are checked and submitting them as data the inputs are not inside a form and the button is not a submit button according to fiddler the only data is in the form of input name inputname input value inputvalue 
no relation between the calling of to array and json just that i want my json with only arrays may i ask why then the query first to array toarray returns the internal variables as an array 
i m using cakephp 314 using it for a webservice https github com qarox cakephp nsapi blob master src webservice driver ns api nsapi php https github com qarox cakephp nsapi blob master src webservice stations webservice stationswebservice php here is a small example what i m doing without the accept encoding header the server sends the response in chunks 
my bad i am using cake php cakephp 306 the association between the two is that other belongs to belongsto events 
of course i removed the useless code like classes and other non input elements my form is using a form template located in config app form php input declaration 
well i m not sure where to look further it just doesn t go into the layout nor view files at that point anything else i should check for or data dump i should dig out edit in my unit test i get this  edit 2 edit2 the get being referenced is the view block viewblock get method being called from view fetch 
markstory i originally didn t use virtual but i added it in after to see if it would fix it
for example after i generate below link by paginator helper that was ignore request query sort time single predict page sort 2sort time
i was trying to use extract from a result set from some associated tables actually something like  there are timestamp fields in all of these tables and those seem to be causing the problem update i wasn t sure if i could use the twice so i tried to extract from other model field which gave the same error edit i just saw your reply sure i ll get back to you 
i think for a has one hasone it should be deleted by default but have an option to override however this behaviour should be consistent with has many hasmany associations to avoid confusion 
no problems strangely enough i can t seem to get a test case that fails on the current code even though i m seeing the effects in a running app i ll dig in and pr as soon as i have all the parts together 
no as far as i understand any idea how to check it i have pretty much just default xampp installation 
31
burzum great work really like your approach and hope to see it merged soon and maybe also done for other parts of cake 
actually not is it mandatory 
correct sorting on the choosen key like this for descending  array   here it was sorted on the extra key with values descending elements without the extra key have a null value so they were added at the bottom for ascending directions the elements without the extra key would be the first after sorting 
thinking out loud something like  i m sure i m not using the right syntax hopefully it s clear that i m just trying to communicate the concept i mean i m assuming that since the namespace change is made inside of skeleton controller skeletoncontroller php only then it must be looking in that file even when the namespace is incorrect 
saeideng i don t use custom route class i use built in dashed route dashedroute class markstory method become an array because  i call this method set methods setmethods get post in routes php it will set default method to an array get post  i don t provide the method option when calling url build i don t provide it because i use named route that what i expect is only need to pass the name option  at this line https github com cakephp cakephp blob src 356src routing route collection routecollection php l 316 l316 will use default method which is an array here is var dump output of route defaults 
nope composed new cakephp project and did what mentioned above 
no but i do have a before validate beforevalidate 
they are simple strings but i set them more clearly controller this set category alkoholos italok this set subcategory sor view php echo this form create product type get url controller products action index category subcategory  and the result is the above mentioned issue 
none of these codes is the problem since i now have simply install version 33 and add a media plugin that contains assets in its webroot here is the error screenshot https i gyazo com e a fd c e d aa e b e4277a3fd7c970e28d4064958aa97e9b png the app min js is in plugins media webroot js app min js 
it works without the error 
ahhh this is why it s odd though it actually worked to allow add in the cases where it was singular shrug oh well changing it did fix my stuff 
app controller app controller appcontroller if i open an sidepanel after logout in another browser tab the server answer is forbidden 403 and not rendered the hello debug 
a dmad admad i have done support in my project in fact i have expanded a lot of features include di and this  i just want cake core can support parsing env by default 
lorenzo i did not realize that the format of the timezone was wrong and i had not met the similar problem
lorna mitchell has a pr for the nexmo sdk here https github com nexmo nexmo php pull 175 and michael heap asked her if that pr should allow version 20 as well so nexmo s aware of the issue and i don t think the cake php cakephp dependency version needs to be relaxed perhaps we should flag the x 1x vs x 2x diactoros change in the release notes or migration guide from my standpoint this issue can be closed nexmo is aware that at least one framework has moved up to requiring diactoros 20

i can try but i am total beginner with cakephp 
mh i m not sure if there is any need for maintaining compatibility to prior versions people who do not have that issue with session sharing should not be effected by a change the worst thing that could happen is that a users is logged out after a version update of cake afterwards it should work as before for standalone usage and better if you try something like this and i assume that could be helpful for people who upgrade larger systems 
my application is default no additional packages this error sometimes happens sometimes not every time while submitting a form my forms are completely created using the documentation recommendations this error started happening after i upgraded from x 35x to 363 i updated composer json based on an application i already started using op x 36x
yes that was the first thing that i tried but since the password field is being hidden by default it kinda creeped me out to remove it since it s basically a second password of course digest authenticate digestauthenticate unsets the field but in all other parts the user object will have it not trying to pretend to be an expert here 
the below is what i m trying to do quite possibly matching is not the right approach the or below is what i mean by or matching ormatching i realize this would cause duplicates article ids so one would have to add manually via distinct group by a id

hello markstory i will try again this today with this tips that you guys gave me and yes i have an example of how rails work to make a really ease ajax development you can downdload this project https github com andre lz gava andrelzgava demo this is a very simple project demonstrating of how to make ajax in rails i just have done a scaffold bake in books and made some changes to make work with ajax and this was ready in functionallity in just 30 minutes if you have any doubt feel free to ask and i will explain how this works d
no wasn t when u said i searched in documentation and found to set this request trust proxy trustproxy true i should do it before calling function or there is a specific place to put it i put code inside a function that should get the user login tried localy and didnt work tried on server didn t work too server is behind proxy

after some tests i m not sure that cake php cakephp is the problem i think that cake dc cakedc search is doing something that cake can t handle anyway i personally fixed my bug 
i have  via php i 
the result is url chelsea wolfe juz za tygodnie 2tygodnie na jedynym koncercie w polsce html 51586html but i guess it should be empty string i have no rewriting on web server the router configuration beside cake standard  for this url is routes connect slug id suffix controller  news action  view name  news pass  id slug suffix id  09 suffix  html 
great question when i first tried that it didn t work but that s because i had a typo in my closing tag it does work as you suggest so no need for this i guess 
yes i have cleared all cache 
if there s method to use its both of function and expression are ok 
yes they do but constraint violation is only a safety measure and should not be relied on the problem is that we ignore results of checks done by application rules and could not inform user with some meaningful error description what we get instead is a database error and application crash because of constraint violation in dependent delete helper dependentdeletehelper php function cascade delete cascadedelete always returns true it should return false if not all associated entities were deleted and code that calls cascade delete cascadedelete should abort transaction if delete fails 
how about you try to use the northwind sample database https github com jpwhite northwind jpwhite3northwind sq lite blob sqlite3blob master northwind small sqlite i just tried it for customers table and got the same result the only thing that changed are those two lines and adding the file 
yes it seems to be related abstract interp cpp compiled fine with 48 now at 60 of the build 
afraid i don t have time to try and narrow it down at the moment but i would test with huge like mb 100mb data values of objects that contain nested massively arrays and see if that triggers a problem it s definitely not a concurrency problem as it happens on nd 2nd request always 
the intention of this option would be to preserve the original usage and suppress the hiphop specific arguments therefore you wouldn t be able to pass hiphop specific arguments a wrapper would work but would complicate the usage in a different way ideally the compiled program should stand alone 
hi i tried to make a very small project to reproduce this bug with no success so i did another test i changed the order of properties in the definition within the class code happened what i expected the error moved to another property the final workaround for this problem was to change all static private properties to protected in this particular class and all works fine in the hiphop binary strange is that there are many classes with private static properties in my codebase which had no problem at all thanks for your great work on hip hop hiphop we re using it to serve web content for 18 million unique users per month with fantastic results in comparison to apache thanks to hip hop hiphop we have much more free ram lower load much better response times keep it up cheers lubos

hi scott libxml el 551 26262128el551
what do you mean 
a local dns cache resolver does not solve the thread contention problem present on the libc we use pdnsd and it obviously helps but more at a network level to avoid our internal dns server to be continuously hit by the same requests you can even populate your hosts file with your most frequent resolved hostnames and you still reach thread contention with enough dns resolutions threads because only one thread could be on the critical section 
the package is not a git archive probably i need to try pulling the source from git and build it lemme see how it goes with regular route 
the project of php code is others i can not modify their source php code they used autoload function in php so i must modify the behavior of implement of autoload in hhvm
fixed

seems okay after removing that file i ll keep an eye on it i set php fpm as a fallback in case hhvm crashes again is it possible something corrupted the hhvm hhbc file somehow edit i completely turned off hhvm since i m experiencing slow page loads and high cpu usage i m still using it for one single site so i ll let you know if i see it again for that site i guess it s unlikely since it gets a small amount of traffic compared to the other sites on the same server 
thanks for resolving next time i compile the actual version i ll give it a try 
scannell that s a debug version already but it s not so simple to reproduct the crach i ll try to 
may this precompiled sources should be done for each merge it s a waste of resource to have travis ci compiling exactly the same for the whole matrix see before script in travis yml 
yeah seems odd since i tried it on a clean build the test runner is broken for me as well 
i used tutorial in here https github com facebook hhvm wiki prebuilt packages on fedora 20 what was lacking when i install it 
let me try to move it around you may be right and if so i apologize in advance

could help me what nginx setting should i modify 
ptarjan sure what is pr 
yes it does here is a complete file that when run with hhvm returns the error  changing callable to any other type e g int will cause the error to go away 
shouldn t it be the user who checks for valid input ranges substr works the same and if people know about that they can use it for themselves i know that it could be more error prone but it gives a really neat feature on the other hand iterating over strings with foreach should result in a character wise dissection as every native function in php works on a per byte basis 
it occurred at make time 
arch linux i tried both the proposed 32 pkgbuild https aur archlinux org packages hhvm and also building from the 32 branch i was able to successfully build on master without changing anything 
yes it works as same as mod php under php fpm
joel marcey joelmarcey i m not really sure how i can go about that as the crashes are not happening at any consistent point but at seemingly random points the only consistency is the hphp string data stringdata release data slow path releasedataslowpath method that s crashing i m not sure if it s relevant but the perf map files that sit alongside the stacktraces in each one that i ve looked at or compared to the stacktraces are for the most part showing completely unrelated bits of code from crash to crash at the point of the faults jo con el both of the servers that this is happening on are ubuntu vps s running 1404 nginx 163 and word press wordpress with hhvm installed via apt get both were running 320 in production without problems and immediately started crashing once hhvm was upgraded to 330 in both cases i ve had to rollback hhvm 320 because hhvm will not stay alive longer than 34 page requests 
fredemmott do i just set hhvm log native stack trace true and wait for the next crash happen or i need to have hhvm dbg installed 
sorry i am not able to reproduce it with a script i tried it seems it happens after random number of requests 
thanks all ideally php and hhvm would behave consistently but yes i d agree that php s behavior may not be intentional or correct opening a bug against php 5 php5 sounds reasonable dmitry soshnikov dmitrysoshnikov i don t know of any case where you would want to encode a closure and get anything meaningful back when you decode it but i ran into this because there happened to be a closure mixed into the content i actually cared about one interesting comparison with java script javascript and php here 
only if you ll take the innitiative i m very sure its not difficult at all for the one who wrote that documentation for the first time
i found these errors  i also found this thread https bitcointalk org index php topic 3043890 with an error with a similar message since i am using docker machine on mac docker environment through a virtuabox i will try to increase the vm memory and see if it works if i have luck or not i will post here but if anyone has other clues please i would appreciate any help thank you in advance 
it s certainly unclear to me i just know that it does 
the list could be shortened by allowing the annotation to include a super type of all of the exceptions that could be thrown i would also think that a single function that is able to throw a plethora of exception types would be a code smell if there are that many ways in which a single function can fail it sounds like that function is trying to do too much i could be wrong about that though if you do have some glue code that doesn t handle exceptions yet you could declare throws exception class which would cover any possibility or there could be a short cut throws which means the same thing maybe my architecture design is wrong but i usually have many layers of error handling when consuming a service or library i almost always wrap calls into the api in try catch blocks i then wrap the library s exceptions with my own or decide at the call point how to handle the exceptional case this way each error boundary is specialized to the particular task at hand when designing a system as a collection of specialized modules each module should have a limited number of ways in which it can fail thus the number of exception types that an individual module is able to throw should be limited additionally the exceptions that a module throws to the consumer should live close to that boundary i would like a library i use to attempt as much as possible to handle any exceptions it runs across or at least logically group individual exceptional cases the central code that calls into each of the modules must thus be able to handle many different types of exceptions but i would want combine different exception types into abstract groups then the top layer only needs to know about the groups of exceptions rather than all of the different types i see two ways of doing this having the modules extend your glue codes exceptions if the modules are for internal use only or to have your glue code wrap the modules exceptions by catching them then throwing a different exception as an example say my system allows a user to use facebook google or twitter to log in i create a service class to handle all three ways of logging in this service class calls into the sd ks sdks to communicate with the respective web ap is apis each time my service class calls an external service i wrap that call with a try catch block on an exception i then throw login exception loginexception this way my central system doesn t need care which login service threw the original exception i would never allow the sdk exception to bubble up to the code that glues all my services together the same would go for one internal service that i wrote consuming another internal service that i wrote the code consuming the service should decide what should happen if that service fails if service a consumes service b and service b fails service a should explicitly decide what to do about it even if that decision is to pass it on to the consumer of service a as a library consumer it would be nice for the type checker to warn me about exceptions i m not explicitly handling as it stands now either excellent up to date documentation must exist that tells me what types of exceptions could be thrown from each entry point into the library or i need to sift through the code to see what could be thrown from that call site even then i m not sure i would be able to find all of the indirect ways a particular api call could throw an exception

jwatzman i am on linux mint 17 used the deb http dl hhvm com ubuntu trusty main repo for installing hhvm i had seen hhvm hhbc inside my home dir so i believe this is the default location or is it some other directory i am going to test on ubuntu server with a fresh install and come back with the observations 
hello thanks for the comment i have to say that i am no more able to reproduce even after cloning fresh project so might be a problem from myself in every case the problem i had was that i got an error such as lber librairies defined as not found 
if i compile libglog myself with 49 and link with that after removing the debian package for it this error goes away however the final linking of cxx executable hhvm now fails i suspect for similar reasons because of boost 
yes the problem is only the charset 
was fixed in https github com facebook hhvm commit c df e b bc d f ee e a 25c12df80e929b286bc72556d8f346ee835e097a
photodude craigcarnell if this is caused by what orvid suggested i suspect it affects joomla and magento as well but we haven t run any benchmarks 
https v l 3v4l org bh j perf 6bhj5perf tabs but i was testing both warmed up and cold on own machine there are frameworks based on the use require once statement such constructs can be used many times i suppose that it is necessary to pay attention to the design perhaps there s just some piece misunderstanding 
lexidor ah i ve got to say it s slightly consoling to know i wasn t alone it s a direct dependency to hhast which is depended on by many others including hacktest but if you just upgrade your packages it should go away because difflib v 111 v111 has changed instanceof over to is https github com hhvm difflib commit cd e c a d d d f fb dbb f c a 66 cd9e9c60a17d7d1d7f09fb1dbb1315f40c521a66 diff ea a f edf e eab d d l 48 467ea4a798f30edf34e2eab92d8515d6l48

scottmitch i ll send you the reproducer tonight channel read complete channelreadcomplete is calling super channel read complete channelreadcomplete so should be executing http connection handler http2connectionhandler channel read complete channelreadcomplete i also think it may make a slight difference if you are using epoll or nio in production i use epoll i know those two vary slightly in their processing logic 
i didn t knew that we could actually read utf readutf by doing the following byte buf bytebuf bb  charset util charsetutil get decoder getdecoder charset util charsetutil utf decode 8decode bb nio buffer niobuffer if possible we could implement first the byte buf bytebuf read utf readutf and byte buf bytebuf read ascii readascii method by delegating to the charset util charsetutil or charset en charseten decoder and then later revisit the en decoding process with a different approach that said more performance is always welcome especially in that kind of processing 
well basically one has to write http chunk httpchunk responses to the browser over the spdy pipeline aggregating the chunks first and writing a single large response works well not sure why chunked output would be an issue

confirmed i get the exact behaviour you ve described 
yes you need to create a direct byte buffer directbytebuffer to read the data but the problem is that garbage collector doesn t clean the memory allocated to the bytebuffer so if you have some connections the memory of application goes increase until java lang out of memory error outofmemoryerror exception on my test i has a server that received various client connection that establish connection sending a message and close the connection and i saw this out of memory http stackoverflow com questions how 1854398how to garbage collect a direct buffer java a direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the allocate direct allocatedirect factory method of this class the buffers returned by this method typically have somewhat higher allocation and deallocation costs than non direct buffers the contents of direct buffers may reside outside of the normal garbage collected heap and so their impact upon the memory footprint of an application might not be obvious it is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated primarily for large long lived buffers that are subject to the underlying system s native i o operations in general it is best to allocate direct buffers only when they yield a measureable gain in program performance source http docs oracle com javase docs 150docs api java nio byte buffer bytebuffer html what do you think

bytes 1000 limit interval  10 10 this formula looks weird because first divide by 10 and then multiply by 10 makes no sense 
i think that makes sense for most cases as long as it s documented well it might still be a surprise if buffer data that a caller knows it wrote to a buffer goes missing when byte buf bytebuf capacity int is eventually called for that reason i think the data should always be copied from 0 but as discussed in 1802 it s still complicated for derived buffers since there is more than one writer index so the internal buffer of a duplicated byte buf duplicatedbytebuf doesn t know about the derived buffer s indexes when it s increasing its capacity on fri aug 30 2013 at 1254 pm trustin lee notifications github comwrote

we use your buffer pool abstraction for a large number of internal representations beyond just socket io drill is a distributed query engine that keeps all data off heap in a columnar representation inside byte bufs bytebufs out internal representations are shared between c and java code as a distributed hadoop application our target platform is intel so it is our preference to use little endian data you can see our fork here https github com apache incubator drill tree master exec bufferl src main java io netty buffer

i was testing a new library and one method returns a future object at first i thought this would be a normal java future but i was wrong and confused for some seconds so there is actually no real problem but personally i like it when all used class names are unique you can just close this if you want 
i am having serious issues with autoread and byte to message decoder bytetomessagedecoder i have not figured out the issues so i am hesitant to suggest a fix the issue is confounding enough that i put that enhancement on hold for now what i can add to this is that i m i always using auto read autoread false and so in that case i am able to get thousands of messages to work with the proposed changes however when i try to add my own decoder subclass of byte to message decoder bytetomessagedecoder processing gets very very mixed up probably because i m trying to use single decode as well as no auto read lw 346 lw346 it did seem to work for me but i wasn t flipping auto read autoread i think for me the issue was that channel read complete channelreadcomplete in ssl handler sslhandler was always adding a read when auto read autoread was false and fire channel read complete firechannelreadcomplete as you point out was always adding a read when auto read autoread was true so my initial issue was that i could not turn off auto read autoread when using ssl 
trustin the attached unit test see above is now failing with 
ah ok it makes sense to point that out will make a pr to improve docs 
i like making pull requests but i haven t been able to make netty build at all if i check out netty and do mvn install shouldn t that work edit i think i figured out the issue i was having i should have sometime this weekend to look into this problem

maybe a deprecation strategy like guava s https github com google guava wiki philosophy explained philosophyexplained iteration would be reasonable this particular abi change was fairly unnecessary in my opinion but i can see how some deprecation system is needed 
normanmaurer have i written a null by any chance under some weird condition 
well whether replacing most copy s with slice is a premature optimization is an another topic but what i mean by copy is well i forgot to mention that i am not using directly copy  here s the copy as copy would also use unpooled buffers or something like that so using slices avoids memory copies at frame decoder level but would come at a cost of trashing the memory with garbage as there is no pooling for each single packet read garbage and i worked quite hard to pool everything so that the number of garbage it creates during i o is an exact 0 imo that s the behaviour we could use 1 creating a new derived buffer increases ref cnt refcnt on the original 2 the derived one maintains its own ref cnt refcnt starting on 1 and calling retain on derived would not touch the ref cnt refcnt on the original 2 if release is called on derived the own ref cnt refcnt is decreased if own ref cnt refcnt is zero decrease the original s ref cnt refcnt by one also recycle 3 the user needs to make sure he calls slice release so that the original would also be released at some point but this makes me wonder if that would break buf slice copy since it would start leaking the original buffer but i think that could break things we need to think about it again knowing that the slices are usually made out of the input stream i wouldn t go the slice collection route for the same reasons you mentioned 
yes it was surprise for us but with 30000 qps and unsafe code we have 50 cpu usage with no unsafe we archive same cpu load with 60000 qps it is hard to share reproducer it is very specific for us i can try to create something similar but we very limited in time 
normanmaurer problem is that netty doesn t wrap or handle it in any way so it s just inner annotated connect exception annotatedconnectexception without any javadoc with pretty strange stacktrace so i have no information to debug understand and fix it i don t know why and when getsockopt could fail and if go deeper in the netty code if name connection reset exception sendmsg for example tells me something name finish connect refused exception is harder does it means that it was general connection refuse in this case how it s different from connect refused exception if it s about refusing why there is no information about connection refuse in provided stacktrace i m not sure if there are some additional debug unfo in the native call that we can pass thru if no maybe very good idea to add javadocs to socket closed channel exception closedchannelexception with general descriptions spec links for reasons of such exceptions and it would be just beautiful if wrapping exceptions of native epoll would be just the same as exceptions in nio i wrote here https github com netty netty pull 5731 issuecomment 241411880 about this standardisation 
thank for your reply i wrote a question at stackoverflow but there was nobody answer from then on there had detail code and echo information url is http stackoverflow com questions same 34026784same ip block code using netty rulebasedipfilter but one is success another fai
it is not about order netty is not following 34 state tcp protocol after sending tls alert it should not terminate the connection with tcp rst instead it should do gracefully with tcp fin 
tried with cr 3 410cr3 and still got the same thing i tested with multiple dns resolvers local resolver google dns and open dns opendns and all got the same result perhaps it s platform dependent i m running on mac os x 1011
ah sorry normanmaurer i wasn t clear enough what i want to do is to use different allocator different to channel s allocator for receive buffers so i m proposing to add a new allocator and a channel option to a channel so it can be passed to rcvbuf allocator this would allow us to distinct receive buffer allocators which we want to be pooled from everything else which we want to be unpooled 
need to bind additional actions with the moment when the bytebuf is released release in abstract derived byte buf abstractderivedbytebuf is final so can not customise it 
windie there is also the same problem with cr 7 410cr7 in the aforementioned computer it s really difficult for me to make sure what in the computer causes the bug do you have any idea 
thanks for the quick response here s a little more about our use case as background we re extending nio event loop group nioeventloopgroup with code below our goal is to catch basic coding errors in tasks we submit to the event loop group eventloopgroup and get them into our logging framework basic but unfortunately still common things like null pointer exceptions nullpointerexceptions  we also override the rest of the schedule and invoke methods with similar calls to decorate if there is a better way to log all errors in submitted tasks then we can alter our code appropriately

hi maseev yes i do it intentional since there is an scene for example the channel will try to get data source from remote server async but it will take more time such as 1 minute for one http request it take 60 seconds it is ok but other request take 602 120 second and other take 603 180 seconds so it is the question i just debug the helloworld demo the default event loop threads is 8 i use postman to do the demo and i tried to send 12 requests with in 10 seconds and for the first 6 requests it take 60 seconds and other take 120 seconds

the encoding for the payload of the mqtt publish message mqttpublishmessage uses a byte buf bytebuf and it s right because the payload of a published mqtt message publish must be considered as something binary not necessary printable characters like for a string for the same reason the will message inside connect should be something binary when the mqtt broker has to send the will message it builds a publish message and in this case putting the will message into a binary payload why restricting the will payload to be a string 
normanmaurer yes it is comping now thanks for the prompt help 
i like the idea of the metrics being push not pull in this particular case how would one bind for the push events given that the encoder and decoder are essentially hidden spring has an implementation of this which is pseudo pub sub listeners register via the event listener eventlistener interface and event publishers are registered via the application event publisher applicationeventpublisher interface what s nice is that it allows for multiple event receivers http docs spring io spring docs current javadoc api org springframework context event event listener eventlistener html http docs spring io spring docs current javadoc api org springframework context application event publisher applicationeventpublisher html this is likely way too heavy for netty but conceptually it provide a nice decoupling of publisher and consumer 
yes but this exception throws in main ui thread and app will exit collapse is means crash thank you answer my question
in a nutshell this is what i have 
md 5 as we have very high tps k 80k per sec so we have handled this way suggest if there is any better way of doing with netty or something else stack trace stacktrace of exception java io io exception ioexception broken pipe 
i also used one boss thread so you mean the reason is due to boss thread is not enough but i think no matter what happens no matter what configuration you take the api should go smoothly every request should have an end to tell final phased result final success or connection failed or half failed

yeah it s good with final 4116final thanks 
normanmaurer there is a custom classloader loaded script if script creates a pooled byte buf pooledbytebuf it may trigger the creation of a thread reference thread death watcher threaddeathwatcher s schedule method and then the script of this classloader is not recyclable because the netty thread does not change before the jvm closes the hot update system creates new classloader at any time finally memory leaks occur in the thermal update system

normanmaurer hey sorry for the long delay had some unexpected medical issues that kept me offline for a while looking online it appears that the specific runtime issue that i encountered was due to some maven versioning conflicts causing an error when loading the child class i wish i could give you a code sample but i don t have the bandwidth right now to reconstruct our codebase from two weeks ago my comment was less to the actual runtime error however and more to the pattern calling some non immutable method via a constructor is not guaranteed to be error free i was a bit hasty in typing this out so that statement is not correct however i should say
i ll try to get an example soon i m on call at work so i don t have much time but maybe once i ve finished my rotation 
sorry did you mean to say use nio event loop group nioeventloopgroup instead anyway i tried without thread and with thread and the result is the same the used memory usedmemory keep going up as soon as out of direct memory outofdirectmemory is hit 
the server endpoints are written in cpp i am not able to provide them in my case everything runs good with netty 4056 but failed with connection reset by peer exception while trying to call write and flush writeandflush after upgrade to 4136 i dont change any codes except the version the only difference i can tell is the local address localaddress of channels and the connect part seems ok i ll try provide the client code later
normanmaurer maybe it s not good enough for me to describe although an application can create multiple server channels it is definitely not a lot of concurrent creation so there is no need to use static fields to store selector provider selectorprovider because static fields themselves need to occupy memory even though this memory occupied very small but when the application is started selector provider selectorprovider is no longer used for nio server socket channel nioserversocketchannel but it will always occupy memory i personally think it is a waste of resources

i want to deal with objects 
can you tell me how to do schema validation i can certainly add the reproducible test case thanks for quick response 
actually i need the complete invoice object but only the id fields of related 
i need the data from the other table but is not necessary for me to have results converted into object it is just to export as csv xml file format i guess the hydration is unnecessary in my case but i don t know the appropriate method to iterate my sql dql request 400000 rows 
this is the stack trace 
ocramius no you are right i don t add any custom mappings but when debugging i found out that changing rsm new result set mapping resultsetmapping into rsm count query countquery get result mapping getresultmapping seemed to be fixing the problem but that s not possible since the get result mapping getresultmapping method is protected i ve made an example below https gist github com nikolajlovenhardt dcaee a e bb ee f f c 8816 dcaee906027a57e8bb0ee4f8f29c8816
i see i m running an outdated version then name doctrine common version v 262 v262 is it possible to run the new version whilst still using symfony 
ocramius hi entity get class name getclassname just return classname of entity simply using return string get class this which returns cds library mysql entity cds domain cdsdomain regarding when will use  wanted to say that problem happens when method order by orderby gets as a sort parameter strng which contains classname with namespace cds library mysql entity cds domain cdsdomain instead of a simple string like cds domain cdsdomain i will prepare a simple entities and service to show the problem and will share a link here 
thanks for taking the time to comment on this much appreciated it s this that i suspected but couldn t find explicitly mentioned in the docs perhaps doctrine could error when defining an entity like this if it is truly unsupported as far as i can tell using joined table inheritance would still render me unable to make use of the scalar value if that field is also used for the join also in this example an attendee may exist who does not inherit from a member so it doesn t seem like joined table inheritance at would work here the only solution i can think of would be to join the entities outside of doctrine s automatic associations thanks 
ocramius with dbal i am getting the results i am using free tds freetds on ubuntu 1404
ocramius part of my composer json file  in my composer lock there is v 272 v272 of doctrine common 
hi ocramius thanks for your quick reply 1 the error can be triggered by simply calling this repository find id the repository being used the the repository of the abstrac product abstracproduct but we ve also tried using the repo from the abstract line abstractline top level and the output oriented product outputorientedproduct the concrete leaf and that yields the same results 2 i m pretty sure it cannot be a wrong discriminator value the way we tested this was to have a valid record in the database so without the parent id this record can be queried like said in bullet 1 everything works fine we get an instance of an output oriented product outputorientedproduct entity after manually inserting a parent id and changing nothing else executing the same code results in the 500 3 the reason i did not include a trace is because the trace didn t have much more info but i ll include it at the bottom 4 i don t really know what you mean with test case but i can t make a unit test for our code logic since all we do is calling find in the repo i didn t dive in the doctrine code as well so no i can not repro this in a test case trace 
i d be happy to provide a documentation patch for version 28 or 27
 composer why not doctrine instantiator 101 jms serializer dev master requires doctrine instantiator 103 phpspec prophecy dev master requires doctrine instantiator 102 phpunit phpunit mock objects x 34x dev requires doctrine instantiator 102 doctrine instantiator 101 requires php 53 but 717 is installed 
yeah i know but is not my query is doctrine query i think can be something in the database 
never used them so don t know how they work probably stay as they are now 
hello ocramius thank you for taking some time to review all of this in the app prod project container appprodprojectcontainer php at line 3072 there is this method  about ap cu apcu for now we are trying to reduce its usage by removing the result cache from it it seems the servers are becoming more stable i opened an issue because i wanted to find the root cause to make sure we won t run into it again in the future 
i m not sure if i follow you the entities card account and such do not inherit from product we didn t design it that way because we usually work with mixed collections lists of products usually containe cards accounts loans what you are suggesting is making those entitis inherit from product 
how do i get it 
ocramius for example i want to get all plants with assoc concrete id is x i know i can create a query builder but in my case i want that will be is dynamic 
i updated the description hopefully it is more clear now is it enough or would you like to have a runnable test app or some other kind of test script 
that s what i thought since it is an aggregate function it feels surprising that such functions are not considered to be valid tokens in this context 
belgattitude first of all thank you for your response i had this in my config which came automatically with a new fresh install of symfony 41 server version 102 i commented this out after a cache clear the issue is gone so thank you very much for your help maybe the server version shouldn t be there by default as it confuses a lot with this error 
it is more a dislike than a problem we could argue redundancy but since it is 3 chars long i wont  currency is always the same for the 10 amounts the way to store this normally is 1 currency field and 10 amounts embeddables should not do that obviously custom types should be able to but they cannot due to the lack of context in the 2 methods mentioned above 
as i pointed out in my fuctional test case memory does explode too however there it does not make a difference if i use get result getresult or get single scalar result getsinglescalarresult in my production code i am only exchanging get single scalar result getsinglescalarresult with get result getresult in the repository code in first case g 1g of memory is exhausted after 1700 iterations with get result getresult all 17000 iterations run with peak mem usage of 480 mb 
hello ocramius thank you for your quick response you are right it seems to be a bug i m blocked by match in orm query parser php i m using the string functions regexp doctrine extensions doctrineextensions query mysql regexp
thank you for your keyword i solved it by setting the fetch options of both side to eager 
it works in master thanks ocramius any idea on the progress of v 3 v3 and would it be released in the next year 
i m not sure i understand in my tests changing the last downloaded by lastdownloadedby field in uploaded file uploadedfile to not nullable will indeed change the commit order avoiding the problem unfortunately not really i m lacking a deeper understanding of the commit order calculation process to be precise i don t understand why unit of work unitofwork get commit order getcommitorder adds nullable associations as dependencies in the commit order calculator commitordercalculator are nullable associations relevant for the commit order if you try to insert an entity that contains a nullable reference to another not yet inserted entity the reference can just be set to null during the insertion and then later updated once the referenced entity is inserted in fact that s precisely what s happening with the last uploaded file lastuploadedfile field if this issue is worked around so my first thought would be to only add non nullable associations as dependencies in the commit order calculator commitordercalculator but this approach causes a considerable number of tests to fail so i did not pursue it further and at this point i m out of ideas would be nice if someone who knows more about the commit order calculation than me could chime in 
if i invert the mapping it s working but both cases should be covered in my opinion we can t always do the queries from the owning side i solved the problem by creating a custom repository method for the unique entity uniqueentity validator where i fetch only the user entity without any join but maybe slc could ignore entities that are not yet persisted or have the identifier null

sorry for late reply it does not work neither on 25 note win 7 sp 1 sp1 bit 64bit
the mb 164mb would take over an hour but it always fails due to network error image https user images githubusercontent com d fcfa 73713972842241339d8fcfa d e c e e ac ef 6d6811e79c76e6e4582ac4ef png 
what do you mean exactly with stack traces 
daniel ruf danielruf puppeteer looks good but needs to download many packages when using it with docker i am trying to see if there is any other available way with phantom js phantomjs and then decide if the timeout would be my solution or just switch to puppeteer 
thank you for the update it works now 
i use cocos d cocos2d console to compile js file to jsc file  and remove all old js files 
ok i will try to test the first thing i need to figure out is how to update the system cocos d cocos2d x to git version for the ui text field uitextfield clipping region problem i have no idea cocos d cocos2d x is not a ui framework 
dumganhar i uploaded the image but the browser may not show correctly you can also generate a file for yourself in http convert iphone png online protonail com i think this should not be a bug of cocos x cocos2x because apple break the standard i just wander if you can add a specific err number when the code parsing this type of image instead of crash 
i m using 204 maybe i should update my cocos d cocos2d x 
minggo i use ndk version r e r8e cocos d cocos2d x version 214 or 213 application mk app abi armeabi armeabi v a v7a x 86 x86 when building armeabi v a v7a it will show warnings with libcurl a like 1649 and i found https github com cocos d cocos2d cocos d cocos2d x commits develop cocos dx cocos2dx platform third party android prebuilt libcurl libs armeabi v a v7a you commit a pull request 4 months ago then the libcurl a is about m 4m and this problem is exist in the later cocos d cocos2d x versions 
hi i don t mean coupling the jsb to cc texture cache cctexturecache in any way however when the application receives a memory warning application did receive memory warning applicationdidreceivememorywarning in i os ios we re already freeing up some resources such as in the texture cache since the application has a responsibility to free up resources at this point one thing that could potentially be cleared up is the garbage objects from jsb i know that gc happens on demand handled by the runtime itself and also that the developer can perform this themselves as you mentioned however right now there is no way to handle the application memory warning event in the js runtime and it seems to me that it could be the engine s responsibility to ensure that enough resources are freed so that the application is less likely to get purged by the os when memory is low furthermore i believe that the jsb exists in cocos dx cocos2dx to make it easier more convenient for developers to create games java script javascript itself lets you not worry about memory management well kind of so perhaps we should not rely on developers to consider performing gc themselves when the application already knows that their is a low memory warning 
the expected behavior should be the green line which is times the system font the other two fonts are imported fonts 
 ricardoquesada i will talk to riq today on jun 3 2013 148 am james chen notifications github com wrote 
develop branch i just want to build cocos d cocos2d win 32 win32 project  exactly open cocos d cocos2d win vc sln win32vc2012sln and build it 
version cocos d cocos2d x v 32 v32 platform window 7 vs 2013 vs2013
cause i am not woking on checkout in my project 
i don t know how to reproduce it but it can be general problem because if i crate project and try to build hello world helloworld in another mac os same error occuring i think the problem begins after version 311 i can build with 311 without errors but if i create project with version 32 or rc 0 33rc0 it crashes

set force d queue setforce2dqueue true is used so the ship and the render textures rendertextures are on the same render queue if they are not on the same render queue the render texture rendertexture can t visit the ship the resulting render is entirely blank an alternative way to put them on the same render queue is to use set global z order setglobalzorder 1 ship d ship3d set global z order setglobalzorder 1 render tex default rendertexdefault set global z order setglobalzorder 1 render tex with buffer rendertexwithbuffer set global z order setglobalzorder 1 however using set global z order setglobalzorder 1 has the same broken results as set force d queue setforce2dqueue true 
nope i use only at first time and error occurred i used audio engine audioengine test this error 
i tried from a brand new 314 project and with the code above 
thanks for the reply minggo take for example unity s game object gameobject transform component when you translate it s parent transform the relative position of the child keeps the same but the global position changes by the same amount this works just like de node position in cocos dx cocos2dx however for the global z order globalzorder property it s not the case where the child value remains unchanged to sum up i think it would be great that global z order globalzorder behaved like a z axis even if it s not d 3d so if you have a parent with global z order globalzorder of 10 and a child with 5 when you change the parent to 13 the child would change to 8 on the other hand if you change the child to 7 the parent remains unchanged 10

after further research they now use a package loader 1 instead of creating a dedicated require function per module via code wrapping https github com luvit lit blob master luvit loader lua their require system works very similarly to node js nodejs  relative paths are supported eg init for sibling modules or init to traverse up directories  module names still work eg foo bar or foo bar there s probably more to it than that but luvit s documentation is sparse on the subject anyway the relative require calls are reason enough to have something like this in my opinion someone made a npm like 3like package manager for luvit called lum 4 its benefits are listed here 5 although it s not mature perhaps there are some things to learn from its design that can be applied to tarantool s package manager easy dependency declaration via package lua and installation of project dependencies into the modules directory and it might be compatible with luarocks packages 1 http pgl yoyo org luai i package loaders 3 https en wikipedia org wiki npm software 4 https github com radare lum 5 https groups google com d msg luvit mpgm r kz drw mpgm3rkzdrw t qw j c j 5tqw9jc6628j

i observe this behavior in pandoc 11242 mac version downloaded and installed but see that it is not present in pandoc 11221 compiled from haskell sources 
currently i know nearly nothing about the implementation side in pandoc and why it represents two different syntactic and symantic elements as the same ast element is this intentional or just caused by code evolution from the users point of view i guess that having a compact list inside a table is much less frequent than having simple tables and compact lists outside of tables hence the benefit of a plain table style would outweight the rare cases of compact lists inside tables but indeed an inconsistency would be introduced at the same time

thanks for the information i m ok in closing this if you are please do it 
ivotron if i understand correctly you mean instead of using include before body and include after body i should put the contents of these files in the yaml metadata block on every page i process using pandoc i could do that but the resulting duplication wouldn t be a good practice if we are supposed to do that then why even have these command line options the reason i m using pandoc as opposed to another markdown processor is because it provides a rudimentary macro expansion facility i don t need anything else than basic templating and pandoc delivers however i think the facility could be improved to make other existing facilities more functional 
mszep that s what i usually do but it takes more time to match the exact settings when using longer komplex command line options with pdf conversion it would be faster to immediately have pandoc telling me the location of the intermediate files by adding a simple additional flag to the command 
sorry i was in a hurry when i posted this i should ve provided a sample so for example i want a heading and then a list of one line items something like notice they re left aligned 
thanks very much

here is the docs https github com textile php textile blob master src netcarver textile parser php line 8286 http txstyle org doc definition 10definition lists this pattern allows the ability of proper dl rather than the nave implementation of redcloth you should consider it 
thanks for your positive comment i personally have not tried the conversion chain as you mentioned the current choices are bulky with regards to its dependencies while not being and not aspiring to be universal markup translators like pandoc going through intermediate formats instead of one pandoc invocation seems hacky to me recently i read about two publishing houses switching away from la te x latex and moving to ascii doc asciidoc as their source format so i gather that it fulfills the needs of technical writing well also regarding referencing and i find it useful to have another capable plain text format for documents if software support is good and can easily convert between different formats and offers multiple output choices which is where this feature would come in i personally would also like to write articles and possibly a book rather in ascii doc asciidoc than la te x latex which is at least my personal motivation for this feature 
i use 113 locally and 19 in my server i update to 113 in my server and it s works thx
as html output i would suggest something lime this http drz ac latex 20130117latex theorem like environments for the web i thought that pandoc doesn t support latex environments so that would probably be something that is necessary to implement amsthm 
oh thanks and sorry i was not aware of this option yaml metadata are keeped using it now there is a true in the top of the final document between yaml metadatas and the beginning of the content of the document like this yaml content true title document but this is another issue i ll do some search about that this one is solved thank you
it works using pdflatex in the shell although i don t know what pandoc uses

i tried to build pandoc with cabal with no success fedora 30 has cabal 2200 and ghc 844 so requirements described in installing pandoc https github com jgm pandoc blob master install md are met however the build process fails  cabal update downloading the latest package list from hackage haskell org cabal install pandoc resolving dependencies  downloading cabal 2410 configuring cabal 2410 building cabal 2410 installed cabal 2410 downloading pandoc 1943 configuring pandoc 1943 failed to install pandoc 1943 build log home vdb cabal logs ghc pandoc 844pandoc g kc e lvb u k v th f gvpd 1943gkce6lvbu1k55vthf6gvpd log cabal entering directory tmp cabal tmp pandoc 21907pandoc 1943 cabal leaving directory tmp cabal tmp pandoc 21907pandoc 1943 cabal error some packages failed to install pandoc g kc e lvb u k v th f gvpd 1943gkce6lvbu1k55vthf6gvpd failed during the configure step the exception was die verbatim dieverbatim user error cabal usr bin ghc exited with an error tmp cabal tmp pandoc 21907pandoc dist 1943dist setup setup hs 1033 error module distribution simple ghc does not export ghc package db options ghcpackagedboptions 10 import distribution simple ghc ghc package db options ghcpackagedboptions  tmp cabal tmp pandoc 21907pandoc dist 1943dist setup setup hs 191 error could not find module system time perhaps you meant system cpu time cputime from base 41110 system cmd from process 1651 system mem from base 41110 use v to see a list of the files searched for  19 import system time  tmp cabal tmp pandoc 21907pandoc dist 1943dist setup setup hs 241 error could not find module data default use v to see a list of the files searched for  24 import data default  it is not clear why cabal downloaded pandoc 1943 the latest release published on github is 273
it won t work for parameters spanning over multiple lines  echo e mylatexcmd a n b c  pandoc t latex mylatexcmd a b c my example at first is not precise sorry do you think keeping parsing the text over multiple lines is reasonable thanks on wed dec 16 2015 at 530 pm john mac farlane macfarlane notifications github com wrote 
metadata see the manual under metadata for how to do this so pandoc is warning you that it s using the title hello derived from the filename in order to have a valid title element this will show up in the title bar of browsers when they look at this web page i see can this be done without a warning if i get the default title which pandoc chooses then i am 99 happy in 1 when i want a custom title it s my duty to read the docs and set it there more than one including subtle depending on environments and hosts for example in the console host run this i e in power shell powershell console

it s based on an existing word template i ve had knocking around since forever i wasn t aware of that recommendation maybe it should be part of the data dir docs 
not sure about the technical details but a canvas is an invisible rectangular container that you can add graphics and text to so that they move around a a group 
github makes the anchor c cmd so i would expect toc t markdown github to generate a toc usable on github i m using doctoc for this at the moment which makes the right toc links 
the only difference is the bibtex extension right i tried that too but got the same error just tried the exact same command on my mac and there it does work without any errors 
the actual epub contains private information but i could remove personal stuff from it instead i tried to install the latest version from git so that i could test it locally have been trying to install for the past day without success perhaps because this is the first time i am doing anything with haskell looks like i am getting closer to an install if not i will send a minimal working bug for you to try arif on tue may 17 2016 at 939 pm john mac farlane macfarlane notifications github com wrote 
ickc that s really neat thanks for all the information 
thanks for both your comments and suggestions i checked pmd version and it was 116 which i have now moved to 118 i can now report that the glyphs are being produced yay re jgm s suggestions  i books ibooks does handle u pub 3 upub3 but some of the math is not beautiful for example bar x is reproduced with the bar a long distance above x so long that you might miss it if you weren t looking for it  use math jax mathjax node i have now installed math jax mathjax node and await progress on the integration with pandoc since my goal is e pub epub thanks 
ok thanks for your responses and for the tip this is not a big problem just a remark in a powershell console chcp 65001 is not enough it must be replaced by
ah yes it does have something to do with pandoc the library at least i think it does i had assumed that commit buffer commitbuffer was an internal pandoc function it s hard for me to pinpoint which part of the program is calling commit buffer commitbuffer but my intuition is it s some pure code within pandoc i run pandoc a number of times here to render a pandoc into variables to use in a template https github com schell milkshake blob d b cd ee dfdb a ce c edb src d030301353b37cd1ee513dfdb2a29ce2c9edb301src milkshake compile hs l l 186 l152l186 you can see the callsite and what happens with those vars i m calling render template rendertemplate with them here https github com schell milkshake blob d b cd ee dfdb a ce c edb src d030301353b37cd1ee513dfdb2a29ce2c9edb301src milkshake compile hs l l 300 l289l300 i think the error happens somewhere in render template rendertemplate but i m not sure actually now that i think of it maybe it s happening in write file writefile i ll do a test with my cicd server and get back to you also thanks for this wonderful library 
ok mb 21 mb21 this is a screenshot of how it looks in my atom s markdown preview plus plugin preview table https cloud githubusercontent com assets fa cc e e f c effa d jpg 627105725577527fa25cc542e6611e785f4c2effa29d591jpg this is how i want the table to look like when i export it i get this pdf output table pdf https cloud githubusercontent com assets ba e e dee 6271057255775603ba633442e6711e78dee e c c cf 181e21c7c4cf jpg i want to have the first row to exist of only one column and not two columns i m not sure if my atom s plugin is rendering it wrong or if pandoc generates the wrong output because of a writer bug 
sure i wasn t aware there was a different one for pandoc citeproc sorry since i didn t find a way to move this issue there directly i created a new issue in jgm pandoc citeproc and copy pasted the content this is it https github com jgm pandoc citeproc issues 289 i also don t seem to be able to close this one apologies i m not really experienced in using git hub github 
i m using pandoc 11921 i want to mention here that when i tried some fonts it worked well one of them is installed by default in windows 10 arial unicode ms geeza pro droid kufi when i compile the document with te xworks texworks app it works fine and generate the pdf correctly with any font 
when adding these entries to the extra deps in pandoc build pandoc stack full yaml cmark gfm 013 doctemplates 021 skylighting 0432 hs bibutils 6201 then i get a build failure 
mb 21 mb21 what should be emitted is renewcommand textlatin foreignlanguage 2foreignlanguage latin 2 just replace newcommand with renewcommand jgm if you use renewcommand for other languages you will get an error because those commands are not already defined if you really want to avoid handling latin specially you can do something like this for each language  however this won t work for textspanish that still needs special handling as is already done because textspanish is a command used internally by babel when switching to spanish renewcommand textspanish foreignlanguage 2foreignlanguage spanish 2 will cause infinite recursion the first time textspanish is called or rather it will cause an error when te x tex s stack overflows

the presence of body copy in the list is a coincidence following the docx file where i first came across a content control i e w sdt the docx file was being used to describe a web form so there is no meaningful equivalence between the w drop down list dropdownlist and one of the possible values being body copy or dropdown list for that matter in retrospect i should have provided an example where the list items had nothing to do with software things as far as i know the best output when a w sdt is found would be to replace it with the contents of the w sdt contents sdtcontents tag contained within the w sdt i m guessing the w sdt pr sdtpr structured document tag properties should just be discarded there may be other kinds of word content controls that should be handled differently i don t know i know as little about word as possible i ll take a look at the office file format spec open xml ecma 376 and report if i see anything useful and survive the ordeal later i looked at the word ml wordml spec https www ecma international org publications standards ecma htm 376htm structured document tags are described in part 1 section 1752 pp 499 546 the gist p 500 within a structured document tag there are two child elements which contain the definition and the content of this sdt the first of these is the sdt pr sdtpr element which contains the set of properties specified for this structured document tag the second is the sdt content sdtcontent element which contains all the content which is contained within this structured document tag table cells are described in 175217 and are just one of many places where w sdt may be found tl dr this element specifies the presence of a structured document tag around a single table cell the two child elements of this element shall be used to specify the properties and content of the current structured document tag via the sdt pr sdtpr and sdt content sdtcontent elements respectively 
no same result using a reference doc where the normal style is rtl doesn t help either 
yes i would check the manual first before posting i checked and found it outdated and downloaded the latest just to double check mb 21 mb21 has a good enough suggestion i believe

thanks for comments which seems to have solved the problem in fact big pandoc md files are not a problem even a many thousand pages file was rendered properly but when a tex header file and latex commands were included the system crashed i have no idea how to limit memory of pandoc s haskell and even if i limited how should this solve the problem but your comments guided me to https github com jgm pandoc issues 3169 i added trace and everything seems to be ok have to run additional tests perhaps someone can explain why tracing every step on stdout may remedy the problem 
this seems to work other metadata fields are still not there though although they appear in the template see here https groups google com forum topic pandoc discuss gf at 4gfat eh wt y ehwty but i guess i should open a new issue for this if this turns out to be a bug right 
it s a stretch to consider that someone would want empty input for some main sequence of workflow perhaps someone might try to test the effect is something else were failing for unknown causes the main reason i would favor the base case not being treated as a special case is that in a scripted or otherwise automated environment the result is more likely to match the assumptions of the calling mechanism if the empty set is handled simply as the trivial case i place reduced emphasis on such a strong parallel to the cli handling files omitted on the command line meaning that standard input is read is a familiar metaphor mostly these reasons relate to what is natural for someone to write when working in the interactive command prompt not about the way one thinks of the data structure that would be constructed internal to application as a result the strict interpretation of the cli metapor translates poorly to the yaml data block however it is a good idea that an explicit value can be given that has the same affect as the field being omitted i suppose one option would be that boolean false represents standard input though there are good reasons to dislike this idea i think my single largest problem with the current behavior is that if i needed to put some value that i thought might make standard input get read then an empty list would be the last thing that would occur to me also would there be a way to concatenate standard input with real files by the way the reason i originally used this form was to create a minimal test case for the to writer validation problem that i had posted on an earlier topic before it was closed i suppose that use is plainly not real word but it s still real 
i was also having trouble finding it i wasn t looking in the right folder https github com jgm highlighting kate blob master xml language dtd
jgm i tested it and it looks ok
the following prints tango when run through pdflatex not with pandoc 
is there special requirement to my input markdown document according to philosophy of pandoc every valid inputs are supposed to be generated to a no error output 
i am also using pandoc 273
yes i should have been clearer markdown to latex the main benefit of using threeparttable is the ability to use tablenotes input  the output probably contains errors because i used the output of pandoc and changed it to what is should look like with threeparttable but you ll get the gist 
a 1a ordered list docx https github com jgm pandoc files a 37208151a ordered list docx here is the file
jgm got it forgive me i misunderstand the document after i change the styles the output successfully changed correspondingly thanks very much 
jgm i use a gemini pda which has gb 1gb ram plus ghc for arm requires llvm which is pretty time consuming in the case of the emoji module one can also set conditional flags in the cabal file so that it is not compiled exposed when a given flag is set 
hi tarleb the given example yields this output  and yes it works with and without the space which seems to be the case for other block formatting options like h 1 h1 as well according to a co worker in former versions adding the space actually could break rendering 
i think a static variable in a config file will be the best solution a list of allowed domains incase anyone wants to use multiple domains if you would allow multiple domains and someone connects on ip directly there should be either a default domain name or the domain name should be selectable on registration 
oh yes missing migration now it s working

sorry i don t know what you mean by appserver i m running on a ubuntu 1004 server installed with the ubuntu install script more or less had to do some stuff manually but basically the process outlined in that script is what i used edit a ha i wasn t starting the websocket that wasn t mentioned in the ubuntu script and i neglected to read the readme stupid sorry for the confusion 
that s nice  but how did you find that o o
i guess with the upcoming publisher feature there will be more flexibility to change templates and problems like this can be easily fixed by changing the template 
ubuntu 1110 with firefox 901 works for me with chromium ubuntu too 
i usually have my stream sorted by date when i m on the home page i can see some posts appearing like it should be but when i reload the page i get some posts which were postet before the ones which were streamed live after that posts are in the right time order 
here you are https joindiaspora com posts 1133936
thanx 
grzuy sorry for the delayed reply this issue doesn t happen now it was happening before few days after its working fine so i m closing this issue
i m using postgre sql postgresql 912
definitely better on bottom so it doesn t feel like it s conflicting with the top right dropdown menu it s still doing the appearing on hover thing though at least on poddery com
it looks fixed to me should anything be done for the use case of a person entering lots of blank lines markdown default is to ignore them and make a paragraph some folks want to see the extra blank lines personally i prefer happy little paragraphs and dislike the extra lines 
i need to confer with the user who wrote me about this i ll write you the steps as far as possible
not atm sorry
sorry i totally forgot that   image 1 3 rows of text loading http s directupload s14directupload net images dr xsyv png 120118dr9xsyv4png   image 2 6 rows of text loading http s directupload s7directupload net images g yxgeo 1201187g3yxgeo png so as you can see the textbox is always about three rows bigger than it needs to be i think that doesn t look so nice besides the textbox gets slightly smaller in height when typing in the first character

ok weirdly although it looks more like a server thing i just tried in firefox and it worked fails in chromium on ubuntu though 
it could be a multi step setting public to the world google etc public to all connected pods for people who don t want their stuff in commercial search engines public to this pod useful for special regional communities and company networks public to all you aspects already exists public to specific aspects already exists 
this problem has persisted for a few days with all browsers during the christmas holidays then it was fixed i m sorry i should close this issue 
i m using windows vista i just tried it on another computer running windows 7 and i m having the same issue there 
i did a little test myself https pod elephly net posts 41556 it works with firefox and doesn t with chrome with chrome there is an extra bullet point at the end 
ostatus is having a similar issue regarding one of the wordpress plugins for ostatus not setting this tag or something of that sort http status net open source issues 3235 in the middle of coding up another project with a deadline so i ll supply the answer to your question later 
g day dave yes thought i ve been digging around abit the last hour and think it maybe something to do with nodejs not included in debian by way of aptitude my debian install is fresh as of 4 hours ago and i ve followed the instructions to the dot i m trying a nodejs method now then will try again and report my findings 
my pod gets automatically updated on daily basis by essentially issuing the following commands  edit just removed bundle and fired the update script

hey well first this is super weird it told me my rvmrc had changed and i was missing some gems so i had to run bundle install again i swear it was all right last time i updated diaspora oh well then i can find my user ok in the db but the query on the notifications yields an empty array no errors and actually just going u person notifications also returns an empty array so i don t know why the front end shows me an unread badge with a count of 1
ah thank you my search didn t catch that pr my understanding is that to be able to mention someone you don t need mutual sharing but you need to be sharing with that person i e they need to be in your aspects if they are sharing with me but they re not in my aspects i can t mention them this is certainly how it s always worked for me and is still the case in 0510 i ve just double checked at the moment it can work with a one way sharing relationship in either direction i don t have a problem with the scope being increased in this way which is why i wondered whether it was intended or not if anything it makes more sense to be able to mention someone who is sharing with you as they have indicated that they want contact with you with the old behaviour you can mention anyone you have added to your aspects regardless whether they are sharing with you there is more risk of unwanted messages so i don t see any privacy spam issue with the scope being increased like this keeping the old behaviour but adding the ability to mention people who share with me if everyone s happy with this change let s keep it this way i ll just update the tutorials to include this

okay  add a user e g mine quix r quix0r pod mxchange org to 2 or more aspects then try to remove the account from one by clicking on the check symbol next to it a red message appears that it fails to remove setting a user agent for my pod doesn t fix this in firebug it says delete https pod mxchange org aspect memberships 326 403 forbidden ms 160ms so maybe i need to allow that type of http request or can you rewrite it

well i believe all options in http unicorn bogomips org unicorn configurator html should be configurable personally i change the pid and socket lines then one would like to change the backlog number the user group which the worker could run etc also the working directory http unicorn bogomips org unicorn configurator html method i working directory is useful 
it is for smartphones only it is very hard to use on a normal phone try using diaspora with the linked emulator to see what i mean 
you should be able to replicate by choosing by random yourself two pods to test the scenario described 
no error just can t find the local user by name only if i enter the complete diaspora id as i remember there was a problem with the redis server when i register this account thanks 
good point yeah was shared to all aspects tried all kind of combinations now all aspects public visible in every aspect stream just for particular fun  visible in fun stream i was just really suprised that if i post multiple posts in a short time the aspects with low activity did contain mostly just my posts on top the point is for me personally it doesn t make sense to show posts from myself in the aspects view currently diaspora is designed to do so but can this maybe be discussed 
thefox 41 thefox41 do you mean settings js jhass i have just had a look the only error in the log is failing human verification which is obviously failing to answer it correctly on the other hand here is the last few lines on the log 
 the buttons seem to keep their last state so i can easily keep sharing if i do not want to or stop sharing even if all i wanted is not share a single posting i can share to other media by topic i e if i connect to a specific tumblr account for my photography i can continue using diaspora and whenever i post something tagged photography that ends up in the right place without me having to toggle buttons on wed feb 8 2017 at 1147 pm goob notifications github com wrote

i ve recompiled it and the issue still exist window not responsive the only thing that changed was instead of displaying 00 it displays 00 in rgui retroarch cfg value fastforward ratio 0000003 i don t remember if it was the same in the last build and i m not too knowledgeable to revert commits 
it s fixed in nightly feb 18
i can t tell you the exact commit because i use your official releases i can say that 167 doesn t have this problem but 169 yes and 17 too when you released 169 i updated but i see that problem so i rollback to a copy of 167 with 17 the same but i try to move retro arch retroarch folder from d emulacin to d and it worked you see in the post the correct ui i moved again to d emulacin and the black squares appeared again i deleted this and recovered again my 167 backup 
i don t have access to the desktop version sadly
i have been testing out usa reigon rom s such as power stone 2 and dino crisis 1 i installed retroarch through the feren os software store feren os is based on linux mint there s also a separate issue of cores not downloading from it s default settings and directories so i had to make my own folder for cores under my documents folder in order to do so as for video i have the default settings left on in drivers and the core ra drivers video https user images githubusercontent com f f e b f a d png 4124313559548552f50710008f0511e987b9f423a245d649png

yes it did and again thank you very much i had made a post but quickly deleted it stupid on my end and i realized as soon as i hit the comment button i ve got a busy day ahead but i will start making public android compiles asap 
overlay does not depend of touch support 
ok i ll try that the reason i wanted to change the port its because when i try to host a game the app freezes completely and i have to do a force quit my guess is that because my default port is not open and it s not that s the reason the app crashes that s why i was changing the port for one i already got opened and stumbled upon that key duplicating issue hope it works thank you 
i will try that are there plans to fix that i assume this is an issue for all touch based devices android i os ios etc thanks 
i never changed anything in the retroarch config file i didn t understand why and how this value could change 
it totally does it s under input input hotkeys bind game focus toggle the default is scroll lock or something awkward to get to on portables so i changed it to num lock maybe your problem is that you have it to a combination of keys that causes problems being recognized somehow or because it s not a natural toggle key like the x lock keys though i don t know why that wouldn t work what it does is to toggle every single hotkey that is system related off and on while running the core and not on menus ie not retropad controller bindings the disabled keys don t include the menu shortcut for the retropad thankfully even on cores where start and select  the combination i have bound to enter and rightshift aren t bound to the core like scummvm 
my suspicion is that the division of work of task save handler that was probably related to the widget to make it display is slowing down the file i o i haven t found where that division is done or how to affect the granularity some help please 
orbea perfect thanks i think for the initial test 1 connect 1 wiimote and your dolphin bar 2 configure wiimote as a retroarch controller via the usual way please use udev as your input driver 3 load up the libretro test core it s in https github com libretro libretro samples tree master tests test but don t seem to be on the buildbot anymore hmm 4 turn on logging settings logging logging verbosity on debug panel on 6 press the dpad whilst wiggling the wiimote 7 paste log here i m hoping it displays mouse or pointer data from the wiimote and data from the joypad functions but anecdotally apparently it only does the latter

https github com libretro retro arch retroarch commit e ed bf a e ac a f af a 8e7477ed079bf71682a8e2ac442a1f94374af71a seems to have corrected this situation it builds and links without issue basic testing was also a success 
yea thats what i m saying it s an issue not just settings i m looking for im pretty sure they aint there or that perhaps it doesn t work right that would be an issue right 
yup i was able to build as normal 
yes immediate crash
yes they do that s why i provided the screens indicating they were present in the core info it shows the md 5 md5 and i also checked for the wiki while getting my bios to make sure they matched on md 5 md5 as well 
i am using a gb 32gb memory card that has approx gb 3gb free i manually downloaded the thumbs for genesis on my pc version of retroarch and ftp d them into the thumbnails dir on the vita they loaded up fine after retroarch launched but the downloading failed no matter what pack i selected is there a requirement for a specific amount of free disk also i looked around but couldnt find any sort of log is there a way i can enable one from the ui and then provide it or analyze it myself to see whether i can contribute to a fix i believe i saw someone else having this issue on a subreddit so its possible im not alone 
this problem happens with git master i update retroarch almost every day it happens with all the cores i ve tried bsnes mercury performance beetle psx hw gambette parallel fba i downloaded the cores again before trying them i tried both an x 11 x11 session and a wayland session kde plasma 5 but the crash happens every time i close a game 
i would say 4 days ago top but i m not really sure 
retroarch starts with a dummy core that has a x 240 320x240 frame if there is no core it should not show a dar at all or it should say something like 11 par unknown dar i just started nestopia and it correctly mapped 11 par to 87 dar i am using the linux version from a day or so ago i loaded nestopia core and went back to the setting it still said 11 par is 43 dar integer scale and crop overscan with a restart made no difference also i tried the vita version starting up the nestopia core bubble it still said 11 par is 43 dar both of them are version 136 nestopia wip 148wip f 4405 70f4405
yes it renders fine and i just tested with rgui and overlay using a text editor and it still crashes 
i ve just mentioned it because its service is up so nevermind that detail 
okay it works at least as well as it used to when it comes to nes snes and picodrive also gba now works very well from what i ve seen pce mednafen fast tested on r type and gambatte recognize roms but they don t award anything and those weird issues with snes recognition persist sim city yoshi s island lost vikings thanks for great work

it works on the standalone m gba mgba 
you are right it has something to do with permissions and udev retroarch verbose revealed warn udev couldn t open any keyboard mouse or touchpad are permissions set correctly for dev input event although adding my user to the input group didn t help 
not sure how to do that orbea i know that as mentioned previously a couple of the games worked fine on version 178 stable

i will try i am heaving a mess with controls right now trying to fix that problem since i cant control anything something in retroarch config is causing a mess
i don t think i can do that because the vita itself is the input so i can t disconnect it

bparker 06 bparker06 i only noticed it while i was working on the ocr issue but the code path it is in came from the commit listed in the issue and that code has not been modified since that commit added that path so the sse 2 sse2 code for that converter probably has never worked though the non sse 2 sse2 path is ok to reproduce with the raw screenshot approach comment out the video driver supports viewport read check in the take screenshot choice function of task screenshot c and take a screenshot on an 8888 core make sure that sse 2 sse2 is defined in your build or put some logging in the pixel converter code to make sure its getting called and going through that path if you still cant reproduce it then i can message you on discord about the ocr way of reproducing it 
by enabling fully static builds it gives people the option to provide some built in cores for the user i talked to an emulator developer who decided to not identify himself he favors static builds and expressed disappointment in the fact libretro cores usually require position independent code during our discussion i had this idea and decided to create an issue it could be a valuable feature on systems that do not have these constraints static linking simplifies dependency management it would let people ship a fully featured retro arch retroarch frontend with their core built right into it i ve just begun exploring the source code and i m not yet familiar with retro arch retroarch s implementation details on platforms that do not have dlopen how does it bind the libretro symbols in those cases is it done at compile time with macros perhaps the same mechanism can probably be used to support many statically linked cores in its current form this convention is external to the libretro api it s like a post processing stage for conforming libretro cores that would allow many of them to be statically linked into retro arch retroarch other frontends will have to add support for the core name prefixes as well if they want to use the modified cores for static linking i wasn t able to come up with an alternative design that allowed multiple statically linked cores and maintained backwards compatibility 
everything was mapped from the get go and the hotkey was automatically chosen as the logitech button in the middle of the controller on the retroarch android version unlike retropie where you map the buttons to your controller on first launch right after i installed and tested cores the select button didn t respond prior to me messing with anything i just mapped the back button select to left thumb button for now in order to function hopefully down the road things get worked

no way i m sorry 
sure but that s little better than just hardpatching since the frontend already set up for softpatching there really should be a better option than launching from the command line with a ips flag it would be useful in quite a few situations and i m not seeing any downsides to adding the option of putting the information in the playlist i guess it breaks 6 line equivalency if used but having the frontend automatically select a file and not having a good override stinks

thanks for the explanation bernd however i noticed that when installing entities with a content pack i can then delete them manually i would have thought that graylog would forbid such action and that entities created with a content pack could only be removed afterwards by uninstalling the content pack i m trying to provision graylog with content packs and this behavior makes things harder to reason about but maybe content packs are not appropriate for this task

oh i see you don t need the at all i ended up specifying the regex more completely and anchoring it with and and that helped now i can simplify though thanks 
this happens if i uncomment all amqp broker settings in graylog radio graylog2radio conf and then setup amqp input with same settings as in configuration file

hi edmundoa i have downloaded the snort extractor from https marketplace graylog org successfully imported appliance syslog udp as per my understand all my snort extractors are pointing to system input appliance syslog udp manage extractors  source field messages so i have to use that search fields message filter to filter the logs further am i correct if yes i want to use separate search fields snort message or snort ip etc what is the process to create separate search fields using snort extractor

it appears that the collector sidecar yml needs to be modified to work with the new version of graylog the server url setting was http rclm rwwaq com au 12900 and to get it to work i had to change it to http rclm rwwaq com au api 9000api i now have to change 80 target machines manually to reflect the new url

sure first off all it was a old dashboard from graylog 31 i deleted multiple widgets and added new ones i also changed the placements of the widgets on the dashboard and then at the end just saved it with the save button then i went to the enterprise reports page and clicked on contents button which resulted in the error message posted above if you need anything else please let me know 
yes it s openjdk 11 if it s a known bug then it s no problem i use the workaround tls 12 tls12
this request is really for the initial screen shown when clicking on search at the top of the screen meaning when running a new search but don t resize the widget after the initial load the behaviour would be similar to 31 where you could see all messages filling up the page and any other stuff like quick values automatically appeared above that is also working the same way in 32 already where newly added widgets like aggregation just appear above any you have to resize move them anyway if you don t like the way they are placed it would only save the annoyance to having to resize the widget initially every time when just running a simple search like i do most of the time 
yes latest version u don t need to have a phone to test it u can just try the emulator
it s probably an issue i created myself i implemented a zoom in out button pressing it will scale all objects to 075 this issue happens if you press say 10 times zoomout and then 10 times zoomin all objects are stacked on eachother test case var group new fabric group canvas get objects getobjects canvas set active group setactivegroup group press button 10 times group scale 075 group scale 075 group scale 075 group scale 075 group scale 075 canvas render all renderall

function that i pointed has two arguments https github com kangax fabric js blob master src parser js l 379 l379 so on this line https github com kangax fabric js blob master src parser js l 388 l388 i think should be used value from id argument variable id attr idattr is empty and never gonna be anything else except undefined so now it checks if id attribute is equal to undefind instead of equal to id value from arguments do you see what i mean

i ll try to replicate it in a separate code since i m currently very busy i ll try to do this in the first week of december
still wrong i ve updated the example on http misc avoid org fabricjs bug here s the example as zip so you can run it locally http misc avoid org fabricjs bug bug zip
the area outside the rectangle is darkened the area inside is left unchanged my implementation was drawing redrawing a black rectangle to a canvas over the fabric canvas using javascript then clearing the rectangle for the area of an active fabric object the non fabric canvas has an opacity less than 10 then when the user presses save it just passes x 1 x1 y 1 y1 x 2 x2 y 2 y2 for the cropping rectangle separately from the json encoded canvas client side cropping is in my use case absolutely undesirable users need to be able to come back in the future load the original image and readjust the cropping down the road the exact procedure is as follows 1 draw a rectangle with no fill or border set it to the active element 2 when a user resizes the active rectangle re render the overlay canvas 3 when the active element is in any way unselected delete it and save the dimensions of the cropping overlay it s a bit hacky but it works for me if you feel like streamlining this for a general purpose i will crop this in php don t do it here type feature that d be pretty cool if not feel free to close this issue 
i create two canvas element and then try to synchronize the movement of two board after i try to move the square at the upper board the lower board would follow the same movement and moved by programming however after that sometime i would find that i cannot move the element at the lower board by using mouse event i don t know why it is locked like this p s i only implement the second board movement following the first board but not the vice versa
its not me look http jsfiddle net jv a v jva8v 1 only first animation works fine next are just jumping because of left and top properties are wrongly calculated as na n nan i just tracked down that this rd 3rd argument is causing the problem sorry i didn t describe it more precisely before 
hi the versin 130
fast reply huh thanks  yes of course actually i don t think that the trouble with top left and other controls it s only rotating point issue because you dont need your top left if you moved the one outside of canvas but the trouble with rotating point in that fact a figure which you moved not moved out the canvas area like on the screenshot i guess when you moved your figure to canvas top rotating point can be automatically shown below the figure 
it look like uglify is simply said closure compiler with simple optimizations although i just started using closure compiler yesterday with compilation level advanced optimizations the interested stuff is introduced here you can read all about advanced optimizations https developers google com closure compiler docs api tutorial 3 tutorial3 it might break your code if you do not keep to code guidelines note that minification is just a feature and to be honest i m not worried about a couple kb more or less 
asturur yes i ve made fabric js package for meteor but didn t publish it yet however i m planning to ok no problem email me email is in my profile info 
well i was am writing a program that requires saving and loading of data one thing is that we re using custom objects like stars special arrows etc which are all done with the poly line now instead of extending the whole thing which is not really what i want since i do not need new functionality at all was to just set the type and differentiate this way what object the user has drawn but as you stated that it is not supposed to be changed i will look for another way around this the next time i touch this piece of code it currently works but i will just assume that after an update it will probably break one thing i would still like to mention is that since this type is exposed in the documentation maybe you could add a little note saying that it shouldn t be changed as it breaks the loading saving if it is 
this example is from the fabric demo server you can reproduce this by calling set selection styles setselectionstyles with property font size fontsize
actually preserve object stacking preserveobjectstacking is the main property of fabric class and there is no canvas preserve object stacking preserveobjectstacking property when you add an overlay image with transformation it throws error

yep tried both absolute and relative i went back just now and tried again this time it worked after debugging a bit out of nowhere i m still wondering what really happened 
i m using rc 160rc 1 do you remember which commit it was 
i do not have the problem with a jsfiddle i ll try to make an example as soon as possible

this init hidden textarea inithiddentextarea e this hidden textarea hiddentextarea focus if the canvas size is big and double click on a textbox to edit it it the whole page is getting scrolled to position of this textbox 
yeah its working from the browser just like the other but once replaced mine fabric js with your fabric js from the above link doesnt work either what i can see the error happens if you tap fast i e if 1 take more than 2 seconds between tap and tap it works perfectly but if the taps are with a difference lower than 2 secs the keyboard hides and there is no way to show it again unless you cancel the edit of the itext 
when i hold the control key and press a select all selectall does run but this is incorrect behavior according to apple https support apple com en us ht 201236 ht201236 the command key is seen as e meta key metakey which makes things weird because if e key code keycode in this ctrl keys map ctrlkeysmap  e ctrl key ctrlkey e meta key metakey  would need to become something like if e key code keycode in this ctrl keys map ctrlkeysmap  e ctrl key ctrlkey is mac ismac  e meta key metakey is mac ismac  as far as my knowledge goes

asturur thanks for your quick response i did setup fiddle for this which replicates the issue step by step please check this link http jsfiddle net varun jagfhh d varun598jagfhh8d 22 let me know incase you require any other information from my end 
i generated the latest code v 236 from the custom build section here http fabricjs com build the previous build of 236 that was working perfectly fine was taken on th 10th august 2018
asturur apologies for the inconvenience caused i have commented the code now please have a look at it the main problem is that the crop fails when we center align the image or scale the image that needs to be cropped let me know in case something is unclear 
my real use case is much more complicated that the js fiddle i provided i have a lot of objects in this polygon that need to be selected alone but when i move the polygon i need that all objects within the polygon move together is there another way to do it i already tried catching subtarget through a group but i can t do what i want instead the trick was to keep all my single object and group them only when i needed all objects are moving with the polygon images text rect circle only the polygon doesn t move with the group even if i remove the mouse move it doesn t work 
hi asturur the lastest d ts file https github com definitely typed definitelytyped definitely typed definitelytyped tree master fabricjs i m using the same js file version of the d ts the property free drawing color freedrawingcolor and free drawing line width freedrawinglinewidth are not in the js file but is in the type definition file even in the latest version any suggestion 
thank you both i managed to fix it after reading here https github com automattic node canvas pull 628 i removed pango libpango dev libpango10dev deleted node modules and reinstalled maybe this is what you meant asturur so it s actually a known node canvas issue more recent versions of node canvas are having problems with pango and it seems they haven t settled on fixing or disabling pango since the pr isn t merged i think this is likely what godweed did too since pango requires cairo and package managers often will remove packages when you remove their dependencies i m not sure this makes the issue fixed so i ll leave it open for asturur to decide 
yeah of course i d be happy to you should get a registration email here in a bit it s not awesome right now it s the result of a year of learning and growing but we have a react driven fabric js 20 based rewrite around the corner and i ll ping you when that s a thing as well 
asturur sorry you re right i have a working demo here http codepen io paulcredmond pen grr pjp grrpjp if you add some sv gs svgs using the addsvg button then move them around and undo redo you ll notice they disappear but the fabric objects can still be selected on the canvas  canvas to json tojson seems to have this issue  json stringify canvas doesn t seem to have this issue

i m using an i pad ipad pro with gb 2gb memory obviously my fiddle shows an extreme case to cause the issue quickly in our actual app it takes more time to get to the point of crashing it seems that garbage collection never happens is it recommended that instead of reinstantiating the fabric canvas fabriccanvas object i simply keep the same instance for the life of the app

yes but i want to save the left and top offset of image to database for later use so these are false data 
asturur on node canvas 165 the font style italic is ignored btw can you find out the cause of the shadow problem or shed some light on me to work round this
well i run it in node and i fix it in other way thanks very much
fiddle https jsfiddle net uv drtpv uv0drtpv 1
they re not important forgot to remove them edit updated 
that s the problem why is it always c and not b in the second function call and then a in the third etc the code should be equal to what the insert key does in windows 
updated with fiddle shakes tiny fist i am rending many hundreds of objects without perceivable performance degradation but i d be delighted if you figure out a better answer 
well it s not for security only in the case of my company we use fabric in several reusable components and it would be very useful to decouple this logic between this components for me this event would help to have a cleaner code for example i could extend the canvas class and add this logic in the canvas instead of create a method helper out of the canvas that it s harder to re use between components in this way all the logic stays in the canvas the other option is using the object added event but this is worst in performance as i explained in my previous comment this way forces me to render twice or even worst also forces me to set src setsrc because the image is dynamic and the filter is applied in the server i hope i explained myself well my english is not very fluent man facepalming 
i don t understand what you mean with your first sentence but my expected behavior would probably be that you can only resize an object once it s been selected which i think is a standard for many image editing apps and you can move it without first having to select it i e you can click down and immediately start the drag once it is selected i would expect it to always have a minimum area at the center which i can use to drag it around possibly slightly offsetting the resize controls but i see that for example pixelmator pro gives higher priority to the resize controls in this case 
210 has below change at the end of fabric js when i remove it it works  if typeof define function  define amd  define function  return fabric  
i agree both percentage and pixel crops would be helpful depending on the scenario regarding asturur point if the percentage logic is implemented inside the library it would be once and for all and more optimized than rd 3rd party implementations btw are you considering introducing a built it crop tool at some time 
so as far as being dynamic in our use case we are wanting a jpeg after designing that has specific dimensions in the fiddle above the canvas is actually 1600 w x 1200 h and will give a jpeg that size when using to data url todataurl but we are displaying and working with the canvas in a viewport that is sometimes smaller than what the canvas is configured to be so it is dynamically sized with css essentially making the canvas responsive in regards to what you mentioned about updates to set dimensions setdimensions any adjustments to the browser size can resize the canvas on the fly we re not calling set dimensions setdimensions on browser resize but letting css deal with the resizing of the canvas you can see this working in the fiddle if you resize the display pane or the browser all the parts of fabric we have used so far seems to work fine with this css responsive sizing of the canvas as far as correct relative coordinates etc are you thinking that the pr i submitted will have some other unexpected effects or negative performance impact 
please enter the text in a different location the location of the text appear deviation asturur
asturur jilster https jsfiddle net pvwue y 024 pvwue1y024 i set it up with two images seems like it works with small not scaled image and doesn t work with large scaled images please see in fiddle example with photo 1 photo1 and photo 2 photo2 replace the variable in the code to see the difference 
i want to allow the users to draw a filled shape using freedrawing i want them to see the filled part while drawing 
i cover it in that last paragraph above pasting below 
asturur find only this one when i used the libary in wechat it reported the errors like below img src https user images githubusercontent com dd aa e 1649560239160623dd1aa024479e e d d fd jpg 11e89939d335714d8fd4jpg width 30 i used the filter functions to dynamically change some images s colors till i encountered this problem 
asturur found the reason clip to clipto causes it it was caused by  but i think it s also an issue 
you mean char spacing charspacing right then we cannot use it for svg css letter spacing at least not directly like it is now because that breaks svg 
espindolaa i have this working as the web version but the above is using nodejs node canvas and fabricjs on the website it works fine
i tried to scroll the canvas by sliding the screen with one finger 
i inserted the active snippet it is hard to say how much they are different from what i aspect because this depends on the number of objects involved in the selection 
asturur for browser in react js reactjs where can i find the browser version npm install fabric installs the node version right 
asturur sure will open a pr
the entire image rendered over the original one is blurry i think this may have something to do with object caching objectcaching of groups since the overlay image is in a group in this fiddle this may not be necessary but in our projects use case it is we basically render these images on their original scale and then zoom the canvas out i have attached some screenshots from our project to clarify screen shot 20200302 at 8 52 40 am https user images githubusercontent com c c ea 390484487565601055400c805c6311ea db f c d 91219db33f19c14d jpg screen shot 20200302 at 8 52 49 am https user images githubusercontent com c ea 3904844875656012567139805c6311ea cf dbfd jpg 8cf836435dbfd952jpg 
ah i see now i had pushed the object s data into the function thinking that was necessary to prevent the script timeout i was observing if i use just the object not its data it does work it times out the browser in a loop but it does work  apparently is target transparent istargettransparent too fat to use in a loop iteration it was probably conceived to check a single pixel only not used to iterate through an entire image thank you though for your time  i ll simply need to settle for my slow but functional routine dj
hi i created a jsfiddle and it works fine https jsfiddle net shawld gbnw k shawld239gbnw4k 31 it seems the issue is if the canvas is placed on a bootstrap modal window is this a known issue thanks lee
ciao asturur sorry for not coming back earlier in fact the face of the pumpkin consists of 2 eyes 1 nose and a mouth which are grouped and i was wondering if fabric has a mechanism to ungroup those shapes 
thank you asturur

hi i would like to remove the undo point for the pasted text pasted text should not captured in the undo event i hope you understand my question 
i have just checked in this url https www tinymce com docs demo full featured 
my mistake i have not explain it good enoug maybe i must first ask is this a intended new feature in x 46x before version x 46x the link text stops always after step 5 so as step 6 i insert in version 455 and before as example a comma and link is stopped in version x 46x not its still a link 
i am using total validator totalvalidator validator w org w3org kind regards

hi yes you can test here on windows ie 9 ie9 http fiddle tinymce com l cfaab lcfaab 1 look the fiddle description s
firefox 50 chrome 54 55 and edge 14 the popup with top and bottom belongs to the url input field in the insert link dialog it seems to be some autocomplete feature image https cloud githubusercontent com assets c badcda 1022252120828635c4badcda b e b efa b87811e69169b76174080efa png this could probably be fixed by using the datalist element instead of relying on a custom autocomplete implementation 
oh yeah it remove style when we put class manually but it will not remove style if the class is put by program itself i slightly modify your fiddle http fiddle tinymce com k jfaab kjfaab 1 to reproduce the problem
it fails when querying the document for node by its id and trying to set an attribute on it the node is created but react hasn t added to the document yet i could not manage to create a simple reproduction since it is only failing in a large project that i have let me try again and see if i can make it happen in a simpler example but anyways in case anyone sees this i was able to make it work by doing 
don shakespeare donshakespeare me too im pretty sure i have seen this before more then a year ago still im not getting the point deleted every non stock css i resetted every setting to stock its the out of the box tiny mce tinymce with default menus etc any idea 
kuresov yes it is similar for me but i mentioned that there is no error if tinymce didn t have any initial value only with some initialized value so this behavior can be named unstable also i discovered that in normal no error case but after destroy it has html element htmlelement value of tinymce body element so it has different types and not seems like race condition 
yes this is working fine as shown in fiddle but we are using this html file in another html file using html iframe tag i e html body iframe src tinymce test tinymcetest html width 500 height iframe 500iframe body html tinymce test tinymcetest html contains content for all components as displayed in fiddle there it is loading all its components but not able to insert component in ie always take cursor to the starting point 
afraithe thanks for responding here s some of my thought vomit 1 the feedback loop to supporting react 16 was almost a week to get merged in and then another week to update the version tag https github com instructure react react tinymce pull 83 2 seems wrong for tinymce from a business perspective to defer to a third party more specifically for people who upgrade but need it supported with react 3 ability to just require tinymce and have it work out of the box without a wrapper package such as react tinymce would be the dream at the same time possibly not making it required to inject the minified source in a script tag to make it globally accessibile per https www npmjs com package react tinymce dependency 4 adding support for react ssr e g if typeof window undefined then defer until it s available and then render it again i think the maintainer of react tinymce did something great and i m not knocking him for it but i think it just makes more sense for tinymce to be more forward supportive of react given that it s got staying power and this is coming from someone who used tinymce for years in a backbone app that still works great my 02 cents
no i want to know where the doc is saved fs dir or database when i run tinymce on node js vm 
hey blackcathikari just few minutes ago i got it working i had to put import node modules tinymce skins ui oxide skin mobile min css for my scss compiler and now mobile skin works i am still confused between skin and theme and somewhere i ve read that it s better to disable skin if you import it in type script typescript like i did does it make any sense or should i get it done differently

hi thanks for reply in fact i ve already have the solution yesterday evening however now i have another issue i want to change the icon image size when zooming i was wondering if there was someone who has ever done this can i ask it here or should i open another issue 
thanks works like a charme this should be mentioned somewhere 
like a charm thanks 
it happened because just reference to leaflet js had been updated leaflet css was still old quietly closing this one thanks for the hint 
mourner i m not using the master and need to put together a page for testing i m using the kml plugin xml to load the the polyines and polygons https github com shramov leaflet plugins fs widgets fswidgets it is a webapp that runs fullscreen on the i pad ipad using html 5 html5 css 3 css3 and javascript

it appears that you can recreate this for a brief moment before leaflet removes the old layer in mobile safari unfortunately i do not have access to an i pad ipad 2
no a string of copyright 
yes it is for example wms after the zoom in 2 levels loading a lot of unnecessary tiles if the tiles are rendered in real time is expensive 
this is my map i load the svg shapes into the bounds of the map after an moveend when i drag the map i see that two lines bottom and right appearing they re actually part of a rectangle that is larger than the map bounds screen shot 20131212 at 17 08 https 04https f cloud github com assets a a 555471734536a223037a e c 634711e3964c d cf d ff 04d20cf9d3ff png 
i am on 051 i will try master what version is leafletjs com i experience the same problem there 
it seems it works in firefox but not chrome why would crs simple make a difference 
i ll try to do js fiddle jsfiddle as soon i have the time to do so here is some images to understand what happens step 1 click on a button to draw a heatmap around paris heatmapidf https f cloud github com assets c b c 47590587163685c17b64c df e e c d cf c png df3411e28e152c4d045cf2c8png result as expected a heatmap around paris step 2 click on a button to draw a heatmap in the east heatmpap https heatmpap2https f cloud github com assets f a df e b 47590587163757f363a68df3411e2822b a d b a cb a16d5b7a52cb png result the second heatmap is added but the one around paris erased error step 3 click on the plus icon to zoom on the map heatmapne https f cloud github com assets ac c 4759058716386ac34732c df e e df3411e2958e c febe png 41c1829febe0png result zoom as intended and the heatmap around paris disappear 
yes what you said for the latter point 
meant trigger it ad hoc outside leaflet thanks for the answer i was basically looking for if there is a way to trigger zoom through script instead of user clicking i was looking for fire event fireevent zoom in and went the wrong route thanks 
thanks for the suggestion i think i may have found the root cause it is not related to leaflet it is due to the selection box calling map remove event twice then leaflet certainly should throw that error since nothing is created after remove 
jfirebaugh i don t have a js fiddle jsfiddle for this one i am not sure if you guys had any generic j sfiddle jsfiddle that loads some tiles in leaflet this one prob has nothing to do with our specific app but the drag and drop handling on tablet i wonder what this would be on that line of code 
mourner we ll try to deploy the 073 in about 2 weeks and see what the system finds 
mourner i will try a playground with some simple geojson and see what happens i haven t had the click handler code broken in very isolated examples i even debugged to the layer object in debugger the click handler is definitely added a click event is triggered on the tile img when i click on the layers i can t think of any other factors impacting this 
in my case i have a custom canvas based layer that draws traffic incident data when an incident is clicked i m opening a popup at that coordinate and passing the data object associated with the incident as the source as i need a reference to it in the handlers for some of the popup events i guess i misinterpreted the meaning of source thinking of it as a general object reference rather than the object that received the mouse event 
ok i ve gone through all the code again have to get used to the refactored version yet nevertheless i wasn t able to achieve a simple nowrap my first try was to set crs wrap lat wraplat and crs wrap lng wraplng to null i did this directly in crs js but there was no change at all i added the line crs wrap lng wraplng null to grid layer gridlayer js in line 329 the map is now displayed once but the order of tiles is messed up as soon as i zoom in mourner can you show me how it is done correctly in dev 08 i noticed something different while going through the code of dev 08 having bounds near 90 extend the bounds vertically far outside the map this behaviour was different in 071 please see bottom js fiddle jsfiddle for demonstration current dev 08 http jsfiddle net f l tu fl2tu 24 stable 071 http jsfiddle net j mb 9j5mb 11
i will try and create a js fiddle jsfiddle for the issue it may not happen until some time tuesday 
yes i can i try asap our project quite big and i hope we can reproduce it in jsfiddle we have bootstrap but not see any problem before last chrome version i keep you in touch 
i have tried the latest master version just now it s still the same 
sorry for my bad english the problem is solved the problem was because of bouncing on zoom limits i ve just set it to false but the problem is still present if i want bouncing on zoom limits it may be because of bad performance of the android it s m hz 1500mhz proccessor 
yes it does fix it thank you however i still think there s a bug in leaflet it doesn t get broken if the map is visible i d say invalidate size invalidatesize is just a workaround i don t think i should monitor if print was called to invalidate size invalidatesize after printing if it s even possible to detect after printing all browser versions thank you anyway 
i got it working while messing with the fiddle your comment lead me to the solution thanks http jsfiddle net ey yx nc ey2yx5nc i have implemented responsive popup windows my own way using j query jquery but can make it a little neater this way do you think it s you might like to add to the package i could submit a pull request if you think it would be useful it would have to include a pan to popup pantopopup method too as this is about centering to the popup rather than the marker cheers dave
hi danzel thank you for writing actually for now i just need a marker clusterer for the titanium map http docs appcelerator com titanium 30 api modules map i already use a changed version of the lat lng latlng and lat lng bounds latlngbounds classes because they conform the their google map counterparts and the projects shares a common code base with a backbone jquery mobile web app my thinking was to also change the leaflet markercluster plugin so i can use it in the project then i thought even better would be to just render the whole leaflet map titanium would then have a good flexible map with lot s of plugins i don t know much about how leaflet map rendering works that s why i decided to ask what do you think is it possible does it make sense thanks again cheers andr
that works thanks a lot 
yes it s fixed on dev 08dev thanks
i can try i will work on it now it may be difficult to reproduce though 
that just seems to defeat the purpose a bit the layer control obviously stores the layers somewhere so it would be great to be able to access that 
strange that you can t load that page we actually use our own clustering that page that didn t load has on it about 150 markers indicating cities and clicking on one dives in to expose the real estate listing markers underneath thanks for the pointer might be really useful for us 
i draw tiles from sqlite database phonegap application tiles have reversed y coordinate in database

hi this will happend under very special circumstances i think i don t know if it s possible to repoduce in jsfiddle
http playground leaflet rhcloud com nayod edit 1edit html output click the new control it should have orange border after clicking 
it s not really a problem or a bug but rather a feature request every point of interest in my map both generated by users and from external ap is apis such as wikipedia has a location and a title then i usually attach a popup with more data image link some text etc maybe title is too specific and the requirement that should be supported is something like external data externaldata which the developer can use to put anything in when creating the marker and use later when one need to get the data out for example for identification etc in any case my most basic data object related to a marker the data that is saved in my database for example has lat lng latlng and title the same was implemented in jts for segments and lines and was very useful 
i was not able to successfully isolate this issue in js fiddle jsfiddle using angular so i suspect i would not be able to isolate without angular either here is my attempt http jsfiddle net m l s wdb ml6s2wdb 3 but as you see the drawing works fine closing for now i will reopen if things change 
not a leaflet issue i have something conflicting here 
using windows 81 i recorded it in action which you can see here http opticraft net leaflet chrome crash swf
it does indeed appear to be connected to the max bounds maxbounds property i commented it out and then the map works exactly as expected in all four browsers i tested it in heres the code im using to set up the map  a lot of the things in the code above are supplied via a config object thats passed to the function creating the map the projection is created using the proj 4 proj4 plugin and the bounds are generated from some coordinates passed in and reprojected by the proj 4 proj4 plugin commenting out the max bounds maxbounds line in the map creation block has solved the immediate issue but now of course users can scroll the map way outside the area i want them to see so its not a great solution really 
system windows 8 64 bit seems to happen when i repeatedly press ctrl f 5 f5 looks like a chrome cache problem or so i sometimes see parts of the rest of the page in the picture looks like i m at the wrong place then i close this issue screenshot https 2https cloud githubusercontent com assets fe b b e e ff f png 671423762023904fe0b334b4e811e49ff9643635679f85png 
sorry for my delayed reply very likely your first suggestion did that trick i will test the behavior of the map in different contexts but i am quite confident that it is working right now so thanks for your quick and helpful reply i will close this issue now 
at the moment i am unable to provide access to this page as it is behind a login gate and i do not have authorization to bypass this i can provide stack trace information 
looks good thanks 
less code no additional plugin to get the functionality i think it much simpler to do it this way you can also use similar existing code from open layer openlayer eg 
here is a code pen showing the mouse event triggers it shows the tooltip on some states disappearing b c of mouse event sequence it happens only on canvas rendering http codepen io anon pen jdpdav canvas version http codepen io anon pen r vj vq g rvjvqg svg version another unrelated issue i found is overlapping layers like circles drawn on each state randomly disappear when you change styles of state layers on mouse over event the problem can be seen on the same code pen i can create a new issue this also happens on the canvas drawing only  thanks for a great library saved me a lot of time on many projects the performance on the new version of leaflet is impressive i was looking to upgrade 
i have narrowed the test case to 2 state layers and each state layer contain 1 circle layer i noticed  when you change style of state layer using mouseover event circles in other state layer disappear  the problem in this test case does not exist on zoom 4 or less  when you pan the map the circles appear again http codepen io anon pen r vdrrd rvdrrd
it s obvious how to modify my own css to give di vs divs a larger z index but the issue is compatibility with a large library like j query ui jqueryui which had no previous problems it s not reasonable to have to modify the j query ui jqueryui code itself to enable inter operability though i haven t looked yet for means of specifying the use of z index values for modals and other widgets i m going to look this morning regardless the usage and values of z index in leaflet needs to be well documented in order for developers to anticipate such issues 
unfortunatly i can t provide an example at the moment as additional information i m using https github com stefanocudini leaflet layer json layerjson for building the markers out of a json response from my server api
take a look at this https jsfiddle net u xzasuu u4xzasuu i think it would be good if we could bring the first popup in front of the other one by clicking on it

ok seems to work on latest development version thanks 
i think it is a question of perspective the mouse dont move on the screen or on the map element but the coordinate for the mouse is changed when the map is panned using the keyboard my current use case is simple to display the coordinates of the cursor on the map the moveend zoomend events only provides event not mouse event mouseevent it isnt implemented in js either if the position of an element is changed while the mouse is over it no mousemove event is fired i have fixed it for now by turning the coordinate display off on zoomstart movestart events and turning it back on at zoomend moveend i will look into it at some point to see if an easy method can be implemented
shows the error for me on versions edge 10 and 9 using developer tools in ie 
the simple case playground seems to work for all versions http playground leaflet rhcloud com lit edit 1edit html console output however running my page from my local machine and trying beta 10beta 2 rc 10rc 1 from the cdn and the latest snapshot from amazonws only the latest snapshot works properly below is console log output for the rc and beta versions the dblclick event goes through to the map not sure what to make of it other than if it s working in the latest snapshot i presume that will be in the final release i guess i d close this unless you would like to investigate further

ivan sanchez ivansanchez each ie in which leaflet works include edge
yes the problem still exists in rc 3 rc3 i added a debugging statement to the middle of the test to confirm that i m using the correct version 
sorry i am new in git hub github after other tests i have found the problem it was because all the layers were loaded with tiles that take a lot of times we use the plugin leaflet non tiled layer nontiledlayer https github com ptv logistics leaflet non tiled layer nontiledlayer which gets the imagery for the complete map viewport whenever it changes this plugin has resolved the problem thank you for your help and for the fiddle site aurlie
ivan sanchez ivansanchez jwoyame the project uses angular 2 so i guess zone js could be the culprit 
this is an example i use wrap on leaflet 077 jsfiddle wrap on leaflet https 077https jsfiddle net rhezaboge au lnf 3 18aulnf3 it has worked and the coordinate has changed and this is an example i use wrap on leaflet 101 jsfiddle wrap on leaflet https 101https jsfiddle net rhezaboge au lnf 3 18aulnf3 it has not worked and the coordinate has not changed did i miss something 
bug visible in old version of embeded chromium browser for delphi 
thanks for your quick answer i have tested on desktops ubuntu 1604 and mac os macos 10121 for now not using touchscreen 
i couldn t reproduce it in an isolated case if you visit ride lyft com you will need to login the snap to current location is not working properly we re getting current user location using the geolocation api and setting the lat lng using the set view setview function i understand it would be almost impossible for you to detect the issue without seeing the code i ll try to make a failing test case in meanwhile 
time is not a good solution but you can use distance traveled from one of the mousemove touchmove pointer move events back to the original mousedown touchstart pointerdown events i believe leaflet does this elsewhere see line 10870 in leaflet 103 in leaflet src js src dom draggable js around line https 132https github com leaflet leaflet blob release v src v103src dom draggable js l 132 l132 where it decides whether a mouse cursor move represents a drag gesture 
ivan sanchez ivansanchez ah i figured out this issue we can use layer groups as shown in this excellent tutorial http leafletjs com examples layers control to show exactly the layers that we want 
sorry it seems to be some error caused by a method which ran before the leaflet js files were completely loaded so i m closing it
does someone know if that can bee prevented through the touch action idea from ghalko is there a workaround to use the map as described in this issue i want to switch from google maps to osm with leaflet but this issue prevents this because the webapp would not be really usable with this issue 
my apologies i am unable to create a test at this time as it would require tons of retyping manual copying from a non connected system basically adding in the box zoom boxzoom control to an existing leaf let leaflet map causes this behavior this happens on the first time the box zoom boxzoom is used 
i have difficulty reproduce error without my self data but the essence of rewriting len 
i guess i could but it seems a bit obvious in get zoom scale getzoomscale code you have and crs scale to zoom tozoom is obviously going to fail to if to zoom tozoom crs scale length 
perliedman ah i hadn t thought of that class name classname option that s much more elegant yes this solution works perfectly fine for us since we don t officially support any of the browsers that don t work with this the app is desktop oriented not mobile and expects modern browsers i just wanted to point out the use case and how we went at tit as for leaflet i guess the main improvement would be documentation of this possibility so that others won t have to search for it either in the docs or in a linked example ivan sanchez ivansanchez are you sure web gl webgl has wider support than this css option another issue could be the probably extremely rare but still valid use case of having multiple instances you can have as many d 2d canvas elements as you want but web gl webgl is a different story i have a similar problem in that professors regularly want to get this print out webpages and because of that i m semi stuck with d 2d canvas elements instead of more performant one web gl webgl view overlaying everything faking scrolling elements hacks http idyll lang org idyll regl component of course there could be a canvas based fallback for that situation 
ivan sanchez ivansanchez i am on macbook pro retina
i ve recorded a gif https imgur com i il cz i7il2cz we have the issue in aprox 1 in 3 times we try to reproduce
yes i had attempted to use super as well i believe it stems from the types leaflet definition files not having declaration for get tile url gettileurl function https github com definitely typed definitelytyped definitely typed definitelytyped blob master types leaflet index d ts l 509 l509 i did eventually find a workaround by extending the tile layer options tilelayeroptions interface and passing in custom options which i used to manually construct the url in a complete overriding get tile url gettileurl function which worked

hello alexander hmm but this happens in loop my application every 20 seconds defines exists or not exists network connection also my application can execute different linux commands such as reboot poweroff and behavior is similar yes of cause i can use syscall system method for calling simple command but if i need work with command output that it is right only process class rarely i observed such situation on ssd with disconnected swap but this case is with connected swap additionally i think maybe this happens when connection with operating system and hdd is missing on working linux my application works on more than 2000 at ms atms and sometimes such connection really missing but first i can not recognize it remotely and second maybe it needs to write more exactly description of exception message
this is not osx however iirc osx does not have real thread local storage either and only emutls is available from the compilers 
i was told to drop it in favour of totally imminent work on implementing a windows ssl back end presumably from netcore

i am seeing this on windows 10 when debugging a asp net core app in vs code vscode
sehuff no this was fixed a 21 days ago it would need to be integration with a new xamarin i os ios or mac release for you to likely see the fix steveisok is this worth safe for 201908 or does it need to be 10 only 
when i looked through things i didn t see any way to get info out of it it just expects the code to fail verification presumably what we d need to do is run each one on coreclr and then see what kind of verification failure happens then figure out why it fails and match it

i was installed but when i tried to rebuild it to check if this would change anything i came across the actual issue giflib removed gif quantize buffer gifquantizebuffer which is deprecated and that broke libgdiplus so it wasn t an issue with mono the giflib update just coincided with me preparing the mono update i patched our giflib package to fix this issue for now

hi david i just pulled your changes and updated django sentry in my project it still gets in an infinite recursion loop after seeing where you changed your code i tried to find out why it s breaking but hell this is hard your sentry utils init py is one of the hardest pieces of code to follow i ve seen d some doc strings would help after playing around with the recursion error handler i ve found that it s a template rendering that detonates this well the template rendering detonates something in dj dt djdt that sentry tries to log and when creating the grouped message groupedmessage dj dt djdt captures that sql and everything starts again i m getting exactly the same traceback this time i ve logged in a file the parameter value in transform function and this is what happens as you can see it captures the template rendering and then you see ap ps apps versions again and again till it collapses pre lt head gt lt body gt lt div id wrapper gt lt div id topbar gt lt div id topbar inner topbarinner gt sentry versions uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 versions uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 080 085 1851 020 031 030 13 020 024 06 093 08 alpha 1 sentry versions uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 versions uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 uni form 080 debug toolbar 085 sentry 1851 fixture generator 020 social auth 031 indexer 030 django 13 captcha 020 paging 024 django extensions 06 taggit 093 registration 08 alpha 1 080 085 1851 020 031 030 13 020 024 06 093 08 alpha 1 pre thanks for being so fast in trying to fix this cheers miguel

i don t want to describe our situation too much but we ve got a class of problems that are probably related and we re investigating so it would be nice to be able to tag them grouping is a much too aggressive action for this single tags instead of key value would cover our use cases fine

mm i don t really see an easy way to test with sentry io probably a separate bug but  doesn t get picked up by the onboarding page i ll wait for a release to test unless someone else can test more easily 
i don t make any changes to my system when i copy the error redis data to a new redis server can t reproduce the issue sentry worked without any problem the redis version is 406 postgresql server version is 11 sentry start command is as below 
if i look at the sentry integration table it shows only one integration github is it even possible to setup the same integration twice 
i changed system internal url prefix because i was not able to access sentry from http web 9000 without modifying my host file changing it to http localhost 9000 allowed me to view my local instance in a web browser for symbolicator options i assumed leaving it as http symbolicator 3021 would have the same issue as above so i also changed that to localhost i should add that i was able to get an instance up and running with these configurations and fully tested with a demo c application thought this was a few days ago yesterday i decided to set up a development instance on a different machine doing exactly what i did the first time and that s when i started getting the errors shown above the only difference i noticed yesterday was the build version apparently onpremise pulls directly from github rather than a stable build and the lack of any type of versioning made me give up on it entirely but i digress are those values not supposed to be changed i don t know of any situation where http web 9000 will resolve on my local machine unless i modify my host file and point web to something

thanks for the response we gave them both admin and the generate user token so i m guessing rundeck ignored the second part and just provided admin access removing the admin part fixed it thanks again 
gschueler correct execution level logs such as details about a copy file failure should be filterable for example some jobs have a filecopy option that might not be used if it s not used i would like the ability to filter an error message created by a blank file

ah thanks for your help tito that was indeed my issue 
all we have now are subclasses of motion event provider motioneventprovider what we need is something like keyboard input provider keyboardinputprovider which can be either keyboard gamepad or anything else that can be pressed held released combined with other keys keystrokes could be used as triggers http kivy org docs guide events html trigger events or widget defined events for example i may want to use a keystroke to launch a missile while running jumping another key is pressed at the same time or maybe to switch to another tab i wonder how a keystroke should be dispatched they are not related to any region point so they can t be dispatched the same way as touch events also how should conflicts several events bound to one keystroke be handled i think think easiest way to utilize keystrokes would be to attach a callback to it like this keystrokes register f 2 f2 my callback where my callback is a trigger as defined in docs or a widget defined event how should we handle keystrokes in kv language if we have focus on a widget callback should be able to access that widget or it s root for example i may have several text input textinput widgets and my callback should be able to select next previous widget in the tree 
rebooted my laptop and it was working correctly after some tries it stopped working again i suspect some issues of my python installation ubuntu 1204
tabbed panel tabbedpanel and accordion are basically the same concept hidden pannels where only one can be shown at a time with buttons to choose which one the api for accordion is simple straightforward and well separated the container accordion describes the overall layout and the nested accordion items accordionitems describe each individual panel if i understand the documentation of the proposed api for tabbed panel tabbedpanel introduces a concept unique in kivy content referencing the panel is described by its header tabbed panel header tabbedpanelheader which has a binding property content which is a reference to the id of a widget declared somewhere else moreover the content of the first panel is a special case called default tab which is described inside the tabbed panel tabbedpanel itself unlike the other panels its text is set by the property default tab text not text like the other panels this one uses nesting for its content not referencing and who decided the first one has to be the default this could be a legitimate api if we didn t already have accordion doing things differently i m not a big fan of the referencing of outside widgets as content nesting is a much better model and the first panel special case is just wrong from a design standpoint this is just bad design to have two completely different ap is apis for two similar concepts the fact that the example in the document doesn t work certainly doesn t help on a side note please don t use experimental widgets such as rst document rstdocument in your examples this is confusing since it s not in the main documentation after experimenting quite a bit with the tabbed panel tabbedpanel to replace my accordions in kv language i find them very hard to design with for instance re ordering the tabs is not trivial if it involves the so called default tab also one should be able to switch between accodion and tabbed panel tabbedpanel very easily to try different models which is not the case right now the behavior is also strange for instance often times the content widgets are displayed in the layout until the tabs are pressed which then swallows them in the tabbed panel tabbedpanel this is clearly implementation bugs not a design issue but it is fairly obvious that these bugs stem from the content referencing design choice at this point my conclusion is that the tabbed panel tabbedpanel widget should not be used and needs a complete api de resign on the model of the accordion widget 
sure i should have it tomorrow thank you for being willing to help 
i have cython 0171 installed using pip 
i used 171 back then and when i switched to 18 i think it worked after a restart of the app the modules do not react on config changes as they determine the value at import i assume that is the cause you have to restart the app as i don t like the whole thing and would rather see a configurable key to set an exit key i implemented that see my fork which i personally like better if you like it take it i wont do a pr as i assume you don t  i removed the osx code ctrl q and would suggest to move that to the config module to have ctrl q on osx and escape elsewhere as default i think having a list of exit keys would be a overkill

http jsfiddle net zz xfb zzxfb 5 the problem in js fiddle jsfiddle occurs on ie 11109 as well when i have html set as the first tech order techorder to go by the video plays fine until you try to open the lightbox then video js stops the javascript and throws and error but it s just unspecified error are there any methods you see built into either colorbox or video js that can delay the player initializing until the lightbox is open unfortunately the way the backend is built the video elements are listed out onto the page then video js does it s magic not sure how to delay video js from converting the videos by default even then if i could delay the plugin from converting the video tags to flash objects until the lightbox is opened when i open and then close the lightbox won t i suffer from the same fate as i am now i almost need to store those video tags in a javascript array then rebuild the flash player from the video element everytime i open and close the lightbox that way a new player is initialized on every open seems like a clunky solution though 
gkatsev the fullscreen per se works the problem is the video is the same size as before and not zoomed to the fullscreen http sc cdn scaleengine net i e d f d e d bf 2e06806229d597f24276d8e7d57796bf png no errors were logged i ve tested it with firefox 300 and google chrome 3501916153 on windows 7
done i just fixed it and submitted a pull request 
i m working on the ima sdk plugin http googleads github io videojs ima we need to initialize the sdk as the result of a user action ideally this would be the same user action that starts the video in all other platforms we listen for the first click on the video and initialize our sdk on that action but that s not possible on i phone iphone because we can t capture that first click 
this issue appears to be related to video size if the aspect ratio is not exact to the last possible pixel this sort of issue occurs even on the newest video js videojs when video is resized since both 43 and 169 aspect ratios are not proper fractions you run into rounding issues video js videojs might benefit from some sort of memory buffer initialization if that is even possible in java script javascript i am primarily a fortran c c programmer so i look at lower levels primarily as far as code is concerned 
thank you for the update just checked it now with 485 and it s not fixed ie 10 error object doesn t support property or method da 
i am setting the options using the format videojs selector options so doing it right here s an example i set http dev digitalkickstart dev1digitalkickstart com test page 123 videojs is using flash technology here
sure the error is mine but i do not know where he is for example now part of the video but do not download enough data before starting like a preloader and stops this is the link https www antoniovaccari it video buzz html 1html
sure i can see the problem in this page http jsbin com lirerosehuze edit 1edit this is based off of sandbox index html example with the obvious differences to replicate my problem namely the primary video source is an hls stream the video is different for non safari v 71 browsers autoplay true on loadeddata the script calls this current time currenttime 30 the problem doesn t always occur on the first time loading the page however refreshing the page will break the seek as i described

ok i will try to do something then and discuss about development progress ask for some advices here then thanks aurora js requires the web audio api so it will work with modern browsers firefox chrome opera but not ie should be supported in ie 12 windows 10
hi mmcc after setting up a local isolated test case it turned out that not video js itsself is responsible for the crash but the secure html 5 html5 video player which utilizes video js you can close the issue and i thank you for your help
well that depends on what the client my boss really i think for now the solution will be to provide an alternative video in a separate link underneath the player not the nicest solution though i ll keep an eye on this repository to see what s going on with the audio descriptions and offer a helping hand brain when i can would this be the thread to watch or will there be some place else where communication will be taking place 
i ll do my best with a test case so far ie 8 ie8 ie 11 ie11 with tech order techorder flash latest video js from github source file 
thank in 484 version i must do it myself 
are my comments about dr ms drms and licensing related to video js or is that on my part to make work 
yeah the corp laptop has the co version i m using v 41211 v41211
hey heff mostly i m importing plugin scss files with sass import function you can see example code below after that i m importing this file to my general scss file for information i just import one time example code  only problem in this scenario is font files of videojs if work on the different folders and when you send files to production you do compile or something you cannot use the font files directly so maybe you can create another repo for that with bower support when i work with gulp or grunt i always copy necessary files to production side with copy function of them 
visor is a thin wrapper around videojs to initialize the player and all the plugins i ve written for it it looks like this 
gkatsev does that mean i should pull source and use that as opposed to cdn

i kept on stripping things away and i was able to determine that this is not a video js videojs issue i had our videos in a parent element with aria live assertive in it which is what made vo continuously read everything even the time so i do not know if this is vo being too strict or nvda not being strict enough but either way this is not an issue with video js videojs and as such i am closing this ticket 
interesting i ll try it 
no the file is a temporay file created in the temp directory using file entry fileentry api i got url to access this resource by var url url create object url createobjecturl file now i am feeding this url to the latest version of videojs note that if i feed the url of a completed file object videojs can successfully play the whole track but if i feed the url of a file object that is still being fetched only portion of the file that has already been fetched is only being played no matter if the rest of file is being fetched afterwards 
absolutely
sure thanks 
here is the sample code to reproduce the issue on firefox you will be able to see the video with the caption you need to selected it on chromium the video plays well and the subtitle icon is shown but if you were to select any language the subtitles would not show you can use the html code provided below 
i followed the quick start quickstart recommendations simply importing the css and js from fastly  based on your recommendation i built videojs from source and can confirm that the big play button appears thanks for the help and quick response the quick start quickstart was too easy not to try first

thanks for your prompt reply gkatsev i m using the latest version of video js and having the code igniter framework in my application i will go through the css file and will see to over come this problem 
i believe that would still violate wcag for ios is there another approach that won t break accessibility 
i think i can close this since i suspect that it s very likely due to https github com angular angular issues 14252
this was happening on first use i think several of the functions could have better error handling checking for valid values i think some of the issues may be that in more modern libraries like angular react and vue you can if conditions that will then inject or remove the html portions based on conditions which in that case you can t call dispose my work around in vue which seemed to have fixed this for me was instead of using v if i used v show which keeps the html intact but toggles the visibility based on the condition

ok either something got ran or i m absolutely crazy or both previously a search like http readthedocs org search project q django would only return two very random projects by project and django or celery wouldn t appear seems seem to be up now i also have a fix for the none appearing on those pages just a change made to the base search html template that didn t get carried over it s in my readthedocs repo i ll put in a pull request next step is to unify the template so you can facet down on the same url and then tying that into the sphinx search

hmm i think i misinterpreted the output to mean it was running not installing sphinx before installing the requirements because context was my docs were failing to build due to missing deps so i thought that was the issue but then recently i notice that my docs are now building i think because i d started moving my requirements into setup py https github com kowey educe commit cd b b ff f d f ee 06623912 14cd9b908b0603155ff0166f74d4f4ee06623912 after getting a better understanding of pip v setuptools so i suspect it s all just python newbie confusion on my part and that closing this ticket should be fine sorry for the noise 
agjohnson i was setting up rtd server internally to talk to our gitlab server it s a little complicated because our projects are open source but we host them internally yadda yadda yadda i would also offer help with making this feature and testing it out

ericholscher thanks for looking into this not sure how to definitively test whether that is the line that causes the problem in the screenshot i posted though it looks like it might be but the general issue here is that readthedocs is silently adding an entire file full of rules any of which could cause problems to projects that don t even use the readthedocs theme would it be possible to stop adding badge only css to such projects or at least provide an opt out mechanism

yes article type makes sense i think og description will be the trickiest tag to get right it along with og title contain the text which is actually shown in the onebox according to this http www joshspeters com how to optimize the ogdescription tag for search and social most sites will display between 200 and 300 characters of the og description value so it essentially is a character 200character summary of the doc page 
no real problem but i argue that it is semantically incorrect  my redirect rule is not temporary as the http status suggests but permanent i restructured my documentation which made the rule necessary in the first place and i don t intend to ever revert that should i need to change the structure again in some way a new different rule would be required  because of the above user agents will for ever have to make two requests it s unnecessary to delay the delivery of the documentation to the user and put extra load on your infrastructure

to my knowledge conda can only pull from conda repositories it cannot install from source if you want to install a python project from source you would typically do either python setup py install or pip install when in the package source directory if the conda environment is already active then using pip should put it into the same environment 
i managed to stumble through registration and adding myself to the project wow their website could really benefit from a usability study probably the biggest thing i m unclear on is the workflow i can get to the start translating page but i m not clear on where to go from there especially when it comes to expected workflow i m almost positive i ve figured out some way to translate things from there but i don t know what the rt d rtd preferred way is another more specific question would be i found for example the missing ago translation it looks like it s currently awaiting review questions on workflow notwithstanding is there a way to indicate noun case i mean presumably there isn t unless they have way more nlp than i m expecting so what s the workaround for example the translation window looks like this date s ago vor date s but unlike english the vor preposition affects the case and therefore noun endings of the date itself a case naive translation would render gets added i suppose it would be possible to just edit the date representation if i could find it  but its seems like there should be a better approach

i need pytorch to build the package itself and without that the autodoc functionality doesn t work the documentation that i currently have is generated by not having anything in my doc requirements txt this generates everything except for the detailed api reference automodule stuff because it can t import the package itself if there s a way to get automodule to work without this issue then i wouldn t need these build requirements 
i do not here is the full request headers 
first a disclaimer take everything i say with a grain of salt because i didn t really know anything about any of it until last night after looking at this more closely i don t think this feature request really makes sense the advantage of flit is that it uses pyproject toml instead of setup py so it s easier to work with has less boiler plate and is more modern pip can also use pyproject toml see pep https 518https www python org dev peps pep 0518 though in fact my pyproject toml instructs pip to first install flit and then to use flit to install my package really the whole idea behind pyproject toml is for services like rtd to just use pip and nothing else the practical exception is for pip install editable which still requires setup py and cannot use pyproject toml there s a long thread on this topic here https discuss python org t pip and 191and installing in editable mode with pyproject toml 1553 last night my docs weren t building and i thought that was because rtd was trying to do pip install editable today i looked more closely at the logs and saw that rtd was actually calling python setup py install directly which obviously won t work if there isn t a setup py this surprised me because i had read that the default was to use pip https docs readthedocs io en stable config file v html v2html packages but at the time i didn t have a readthedocs yml config file so this morning i added one specifying that rtd should use pip and then my project was able to build so in the end the only thing i m confused about is why rtd wasn t installing my project with pip by default does there need to be a readthedocs yml file possibly empty for the defaults described in the documentation https docs readthedocs io en stable config file v html v2html to take effect if so is that ever explicitly stated anywhere anyways thanks for taking the time to respond to this issue

here is a quick timeline of events to give you a good idea of what happened i have an open emu openemu instance with every nes snes n 64 n64 sega genesis and gba game thousands of games right i created a custom collection for the games i frequent out of all of those i set up the controller for each console type 1 i plugged in my controller and opened open emu openemu to play a game 2 i immediately got a notification that there is a newer version of the game i opted to update it 3 when i got back into open emu openemu all the games controller settings and collection i added were gone this is why i wanted to back up these settings i imagine these are just files that got sent to the trash bin when i updated right the bug here is that games and settings are not persistent through the update process  john galbraith information security analyst cell recipient 727recipient not in address book blog https tech i tech55i com from clobber notifications github com reply open emu openemu open emu openemu reply reply github com date july 24 2016 at 61555 pm to open emu openemu open emu openemu openemu noreply github com cc galbraith john jagalbraith icloud com author author noreply github com subject re open emu openemu open emu openemu backup restore games and saves feature request 2668 what the hell are you talking about  you are receiving this because you authored the thread reply to this email directly view it on git hub github or mute the thread

hi clobber this issue is for roms that i already have downloaded i am trying to drag and drop from my old open emu openemu roms folder to the new open emu openemu build i did a test download of some nes roms and they loaded just fine i m not sure what the issue but for now i have a workaround

in finder dragged them to the trash then put them all back restarted but didnt work
no 
before i start i did try and quit and reopen openemu but it disappeared so i closed it reopened it and now its back to noraml
if i delete a game from my library and then try to re add it again it will not copy into my library it happens with all games i try to add 
clobber well on my end the game most effective to hear the bug is shining force s city theme it has a strange echo that you can hear with a high enough volume listen to the city theme from original hardware here https www youtube com watch v rc u w oh e 4rc26uwohe then compare it to what the emulator open emu openemu is playing otherwise it affects all the games i tried like the sonic games and space harrier ii the latter which doesn t sound right 
this one works as well in fact if i remember right in the interval i switch from the experimental to the stable version i dig this morning i had 4 roms sega master system all of them no longer works i remove two of them and download it again the new one works attached one which no longer works it seems not being dragable on open emu openemu while i copy it from users jbd library application support open emu openemu game library roms sega master system alex kidd in miracle world usa europe v zip v11zip https github com open emu openemu open emu openemu files alex 2430440alex kidd in miracle world usa europe v zip v11zip do you think possible the file to have been modified by open emu openemu any way i did not have any problem with other consoles 
here s the code ggplot null aes x 1 y 1 label  foo bar  geom label the missing character will be there whether you save the pdf from the r studio rstudio dialog or with ggsave 
try the following steps 1 start profiling 2 source the following script with the for loop line copy pasted for 300 times 3 end profiling 4 a very large rprofvis is produced 5 r studio rstudio server should hang for a long time 6 if r studio rstudio server is able to show it save the rprofvis file and reopen it 7 copy paste as many lines of the for loop so that the profiling get large enough to cause the web browser hang 8 rstudio server kill all does not solve the problem removing rstudio sessions active does not either removing the saved rprofvis file does not help completely removing rstudio solves the problem but everything in config is lost 
i doubt that i hit f 2 f2 almost nothing in the environment the code that i had just selected for copy paste 
from what i can tell if you ve installed once subsequent installations will work without the warning so i need to set up a fresh installation i ll update when that s ready

oops i meant firefox thanks i edited the original message i like to include at least one mistake in every issue i file it s a regressioneverything s fine in r studio rstudio server 125033 though it s on ubuntu 18043 i can switch red hat to 12 or ubuntu to 13 if you think the os could be a factor

sorry for being so unclear r studio rstudio just seems to get stuck after the creation of the md file here s what it looks like capture https user images githubusercontent com c b f a 2204023849180868c3807b80f30a e c f e png 11e8881857419c6f6e13png it will sit like this for hours until i hit the stop button with version 11463 the time elapsed from the creation of the md document to the html document is maybe a second 
must admit that i am slightly confused it worked nicely on my home computer both in r studio rstudio and on the command line the same environments but ubuntu 1604 vs 1704 pulled from github goranbrostrom eha the same rbulidignore etc

not really imagine now that you only need to do it for some lines it s easy when doing it for all or based on some condition that can be reduced to regex with sublime at least but not when doing it for some selected ones nevertheless guess this will be solved with r studio rstudio 13
jmcphers there was no problem running r from the terminal but it didn t work in r studio rstudio thankfully gregleleu s solution worked 
no the installation is not on a vm one weird thing i noticed is that r studio rstudio is running well on a different user account on my computer 
just upgraded to latest 11453 and bug persists perhaps more detailed instructions for recreating 1 start rstudio 2 open new r script source file 3 enter a line of code i just spammed the a key until line width exceeds source window width 4 move cursor to beginning of line 5 use comment uncomment shortcut and the editor will unexpectedly scroll horizontally by 2 spaces this may seem insignificant however when there are several levels of indentation commenting uncommenting the nested code becomes very annoying as an example i have attached a bugdemo r zip https github com rstudio rstudio files bugdemo 2060155bugdemo r zip if you move your cursor down to the print line and repeatedly comment uncomment the line using the shortcut the editor will scroll horizontally back and forth and partially hide code on lower levels of indentation i usually avoid writing lines of code that are too long to fit in the editor screen but sometimes when i edit other peoples source code like i was doing earlier today i come across lots of code that exceeds my screen width and that s where this becomes a problem please let me know if you still cannot reproduce the issue or have any other comments thank you

interestingly i no longer see this problem now the difference between now and earlier when i found the problem is  after the upgrade to preview version loading my current project will try to load a package then the console is like this  i also witnessed the problem with the dragging tabs at that time i cleaned my rstudio desktop folder and the package loading problem no longer appear so i didn t report issue for that it seemed that cleaning the desktop folder also solved the problem above 
jjallaire kevinushey i rolled back but will be happy to load it again and run a diagnostics report i tested on two machines in the local environment neither of them completely clean 1804 installs both with somewhat older r 344 there is no local proxy here so networking should not be the cause 
can t repro after a reboot also had trouble rebooting based on whether or not scrollbars were showing i think you re safe to close this one unless anybody else encounters it we can blame go to meeting gotomeeting and or my laptop being overdue for a nap

hi jonathan with these two files you should be able to reproduce the problem take a look at the last chunk of code in the rmd file thanks michael
ronblum thanks for your response unfortunately the issue persists with version 121286 20190215 i am also using r version 352 20181220 i did notice something odd though and i think this might be the cause of the issue when i open up the git bash not in r studio rstudio and type which git i get the output mingw bin mingw64bin git i have the same output from within r studio rstudio s terminal running git bash in git bash when i type echo path tr n i can see c program files git bin however when in r studio rstudio s terminal i cannot see this pretty much everything else is the same do you think this is the issue and is there a reason r studio rstudio s git bash would show a different result than the standalone git bash

understandable but then it make sense to have it with grey background writable text box could be useful in case when having a directory path in clipboard to paste it into that box that would be even more useful when having a long path of multiple nested directories now i have to click browse then hit ctrl l and then i can paste the path 
well problem is that it crashes the r session in r studio rstudio before i can ask for a traceback  so it just gives me a window r session aborted but the problem should be easy enough for you to reproduce 
yes this is fixed in 13929 for me perhaps the binary download paths i mention on the rstudio site were not updated with the pr patch 
hi i ve seen this i can debug and fix myself if needed as it is quite blocking to have the editor crash often but it looked like an independant issue that you might know in internal i ll try but i don t think the configuration has been changed unfortunately there is no version on archlinux but it was up to date on the date of the creation of the issue local files thanks i ll try this too unfortunately i cannot there is no coredump reported for the rstudio process only for the rsession

here is what i do in my controller i m using angular js angularjs b 7 130b7 with this i get sometimes 1 or 2 attachments saved and then the 412 error for the others then this error appears each time i open my app the only way to get rid of this error is to delete the not sync ed files from pouchdb as you said it is quite tricky to add remove multiple attachments and would be great to have that implemented in the api thanks for the great work you ve done so far 
well trying to get the max date should i do this in memory 
filter pouch is great but unless i am mistaken you still cannot do partial updates with this plugin i started analyzing the bulk docs calls make by the replication routines and as a proof of concept modified api bulk docs bulkdocs in pouchdb js so that it removes the attribute from req that would not be updated the problem is that the couchdb bulk docs api doesn t seem to support partial updates so removing the attribute then wipes out the attribute in couch in quickly reviewing http wiki apache org couchdb http bulk document api it doesn t appear that there is support for partial updates i think i could create a pouch plugin that uses update handlers instead of the bulk docs mechanism to sync but this defeats the whole point of sending all the changes using bulk docs which i find pretty necessary from an efficiency standpoint do you have any other ideas in your experience how do people normally handle collaboration on the same document using couch am i looking at this from the wrong angle

we encountered this in the following scenario  integration tests automatically create and delete databases after tests are done and test a feature that uploads an attachment error in the integration test leads to deletion of the databases before the final callback is called  because of the misleading error message it took way longer than necessary to find the problem

efratyo we re running 0503 i did have to do a lot of hacking to get the memory adapter working although i don t remember the precise steps in the end we had to abandon pouch db pouchdb altogether the performance we were seeing was so atrocious web requests were faster we re using request graphql noramlizr redux and redux persist now to store our data offline it s not as elegant for updates and sync but it performs as you d expect from disk on the device good luck

also note that the latest revision of the swf fileformat allows for a new incompatible compression the parser should either continue to reject such files or be corrected to allow for both compression types 
that is one perspective but it fails to account for the normal perspective for the implication that is one tag that implies multiple others i want a solution that allows the same implication to work in both directions as for an example there is the main six tag over on bronibooru com 
i am talking about invisible html elements at best you can give it a title attribute if that s what you meant then the same title as for the normal pagination navigation links will be just fine 
oh the site i visit is still on an older version 
two things to warn against common typos and to warn against terms that might need an alias 
well the sample images are separate and not automatically generated if i m not mistaken so doing this would require re creating all the samples for the existing animations but if that s not a problem i don t see any other issue with that approach 
ah didn t know about that i ll go do that though this doesn t prevent future cases from happening how about preventing artist tags being to turned into any other types and vice versa unlike the contentious situation that a href https github com r danbooru r888888888danbooru issues locking 1728locking tag types a is meant to prevent there is no possible situation in which an artist tag could turn into any other tag type other tag types will never become artists too there are 12 ways to change tag types by locking down 6 of those ways to and from artist we can cut the chance of accidental type change by half

hi i closed this as i m pretty sure this is not a bug and more of a support issue i also suspect it should be added to an faq somewhere plugins are loaded well after this gem and that means that when activeadmin tries to load it fails to get an active record object i resolved this by turning the plugin into a gem and then using it like any other gem works like a dream be aware the sybase active record adapter does not support the methods required to do the rake db migrate so you ll need to create the admin users tables manually 
i indeed had 187 ruby p 0 running that must be it i upgraded to 192 and this error is gone some others appeared but had nothing to do with active admin so far thanks keep up the good work 
i think so 
ok figured it out it turns out that the culprit was having an old version of pry rails in the gemfile i realized this when i started an app from scratch again and found that everything worked it would also explain what i saw when debugging since i was doing it through pry i tried to match my state between the new app and my existing app and eventually got a repro when i added pry rails to the gemfile so i guess it s because pry had a rails 32 incompatibility or something in the older version but it seems to have been fixed with the latest version 016 basically just do bundle update pry rails if you were having this problem too 
i was using master branch at the time i submitted the issue

thank you for this information indeed i didn t know reorder thanks a lot i ve successfully sort my index page with a reorder because a simple order doesn t works but after this it s became impossible to sort like before by clicking on the column name that we want to sort s any idea to keep a default sort and a custom sort for the user 
if i comment the line  on the view page for the resource it will be titled resource x where x is the value of the id of the item this is in an h 2 h2 tag with a id of page title if i m using inherited resources this will also be the title displayed in the breakcrumb link i feel like this is inconsistent behavior because this display name value is used everywhere else a title is called for in active admin activeadmin clearly it s not a hard work around but for a relative n b n00b like myself it did take some time to figure this out 
no haven t been able to get anything working yet and neither have i had any more response on this 
hi jpmckinney your controller path is wrong need app admin dashboard rb  admin dashboard rb  this is my reason too 
it is a patch for formtastic not sure if it s suitable to be merged into aa but this feature should be included in aa 
which section other 
regards
i tried this but still see a lot of tag load queries actually i found that i needed to update the associations above the models are that company has many accounts and belongs to default account as account 
well they do load with initializers i guess i tried putting module active admin activeadmin view helpers viewhelpers include application helper applicationhelper end into active admin rb initializer behaviours and kind of inconsistent now the other gems split and css splitter seem to be working while will paginate still raises issues 
above example has an error active admin filters form for method run with one argument when it should call with two or i something missed 
intialize instead of initialize posted pull request 2188 to fix 
i have a default scope condition in the model but when i add comment through active admin for the deactivated user it throws route instance path for nil because it looks for the resource in the database without overriding the default scope hence its returning nil 
daxter thanks for the comment let me clarify your questions i don t have a template model and the previous behaviour was not desired the version i use is the official gem release 
the expected behaviour of inherited resources is that it would override a redirect if passed in a block https github com josevalim inherited resources overwriting actions i m not quite sure of how this could be fixed maybe an if block on the format line this situation should be common to all resources constructed in this manner 
it was above an existing devise for call which caused an error
hi 1 i just noticed that i am getting the error even on the admin comments page 2 rails 4 and edge copy of aa 3 no i just reinstalled a fresh copy of rails and applied aa to it and the comments page works i believe i must have done something interesting to get that to fail in my main application i am going to revert my changes and try again 
full error
daxter i believe it is not this problem this is a typo 
yes and yes i had done very little customization and actually hadn t even registered my comment model with active admin ie i hadn t run rails generate active admin resource comment 
seanlinsley filter that is only visible for admin users 
github version of aa rails 4 havent checked production
that was it sorry for sounding the alarm but thanks for the help

ah i fixed it i was using old style scopes  once i switched the proper lambda way it worked probably not a bug since tha tis deprecated sorry 
here is the contents of my gemfile lock file 
well i wanted to turn off menu item for a given resource with a menu false resource controller s option because it doesn t make sense to give access to this resource from a top level menu in my case this particular resource may be displayed standalone but should be always displayed within a context of another resource its master when i just used menu false and redirected to this controller path i got the no menu error nomenuerror exception but i just wanted to keep default menu so the money patch above does the job i may turn off a menu item for a given resource and keep the default menu displayed

it s happening when i enter a value into a field on the index view then click the filter button here are the filter entries i have in my admin customer rb filter creationdate filter lincoln id do lincoln id end filter price mode filter company filter first name filter last name filter phone filter state filter country filter email filter price mode filter username filter status filter business type filter open account
uh yes seems like it s a bit out of aa workflow to fix that at least we can be sure that new users won t struggle and old one probably used to do that 
i have a plain user model and there is no specific user so far to administer the site on url myapp com admin i can hard code it but still figuring what is preferable 
i have partials located inside my app s app views admin directory that exception is shown for the gem in gems within the gem s app views active admin directory 
collection first class is a metric decorator metricdecorator using draper the underlying model is an standard active record model class connecting to a secondary sql server database  this issue seems to be related to using draper if i remove the decorator my view now renders i tried versions 21 20 and 14 of draper to see if it was a change there but all three versions exhibit this behavior 
i have a private dedicated centos 7 server just for my own pleasure learning so i don t really bother going through the whole est stage production cycle i just do everything on the server through ssh i will however try dev and stage to see if that makes a difference

i am not using devise i am using cancancan and sorcery here is routes rb
seanlinsley it is a working solution i spotted that formtastic responds for this and i read the docs about it filter user id as select multiple select2multiple collection hash user includes contact map user user full name user id  but problem is still in there how to use proc in collection 
thank you for your answer first actually i just need a variants text area list the variants two times is because i want show what different they are between new record false  new record true so is any way can show the text area without click add new variant in nested form because in my case when i create a product data i also need a variant data as well but i only need add a variant data don t need add one than more variant if show the add new variant button that s mean i can keep add multiple variants and i don t want that how should i do here is my models
no i figured out that if i added scoped collection i must override the default actions in controller like create update as scoped collection override all the controller action so i override d them it worked but i created some redundant actions cry thing is i must include scoped collection too as it behave exactly as i wanted no if i didn t used scoped collection from the beginning no errors occurs

i think this is not a good test for long format  have you tested it with a real date time datetime still failing in pre 5 pre5
after looking into this i don t think this can be fixed without monkey patching rails inside of active admin to override default behavior from this commit https github com rails rails commit f a d b b f bd e f 5460591f0226a9d248b7b4f89186bd5553e7768f  issue and description here https github com rails rails issues 16058 essentially in rails 412 if a slash is encountered in a rails route without using route globbing to determine the path it is escaped https github com rails rails commit f a d b b f bd e f 5460591f0226a9d248b7b4f89186bd5553e7768f diff e f f ada bd fb b e r 3843 e304f21f210ada0bd90fb1990912b08er3843 active admin seems to lean on the rails router pretty heavily to generate these urls paths so if the to param method is used to generate the route like we do here https github com activeadmin activeadmin blob master lib active admin resource routes rb l 75 l75 leads to a to param call here https github com activeadmin activeadmin blob master lib active admin resource routes rb l 110 l110 then rails will simply escape the portion of the url path that has a slash in it doesn t really seem like theres much we can do about this  let me know what you think varyonic 
here s my gemfile lock 
everything is default i dropped reseted and reran the migrations and it worked fine don t know what caused the issue but now its working thank you very much 
joshmn i m attaching the important bit where it looks like they re using the same route i am able to verify that the login only works for the latter for what it s worth i was able to edit the routes and get the separate logins working i e devise for property managers active admin activeadmin devise config merge path management but the redirects always go to admin no matter what 
thanks it is solved

yes like the pages selection where you can select multiple usergroups
ah yes an important detail i was adding the user through the pyro control panel 
no i don t think so categories provide a method of clearly separating articles by subject matter tags are more loose in the sense articles can have many tags listing the subjects covered within an article let s say we have an seo blog we might choose to tag all articles with organisations mentioned within them google might be a tag that appears within an article about organic seo category organic seo but we might also have google tagged on an article about google analytics category analytics if we used tags in the way you suggest we d lose the real benefit of tags also by using the same gui as navigation and pages it will make it very easy to have this multi level approach

sorry about the delay at the end of the process when you delete the custom field the stream field is not deleted in db it becomes null and you cannot pick it at admin panel it must be restored with the db manager despite i think that i have read something about what i m going to say i would like to add another issue with fields and namespaces we cannot create more than one field with the same name in different page types because they have the same namespace i suppose that namespaces should not be the same or we need the field assignment tool from streams module 
good question the c keditor ckeditor cut and paste buttons are inhibited by my browsers chrome ff and ie 10 ie10 as a security precaution so control x and control v are the method for cut and paste here is the message from ff your browser security settings don t permit the editor to automatically execute cutting operations please use the keyboard for that ctrl cmd x the expected behaviour is that c keditor ckeditor does not apply any styling whatsoever apart from the surrounding html tag for the content this is a known bug in the version of c keditor ckeditor used in 222 223 and 224 see issue 2731 it has been around for 12 months or more and has forced me to abandon the 22 branch for many client projects as a result 
sorry i was not clear enough i was referring to the streams module add on below is a screenshot of a stream that has been selected for editing entries it happens to be photo gallery note the reference to the namespace ikoniq  and the namespace description which the stream belongs to i feel that instead of displaying the namespace and namespace description it would be preferable to display the name and possibly a description of the stream whose entries appear below the title box refer addons shared anomaly streams module resources views admin groups heading twig line 8 hope this helps screen shot 20170517 at 5 22 12 pm https cloud githubusercontent com assets dbd b b e f e f e png 3609155261430136dbd15b63b2611e782f1768e88f514e1png 
i m running version 553
the readme md says version 221
i tried using the version 19 of the template library and when i try to autoload the library i get a call to a member function is mobile on a non object error i added a hook to a pre controller and for some reason it won t work but if i load the template library in each controller then it loads i m also getting the undefined property login agent from inside the libraries template php file 
cause https github com anomalylabs streams platform blob develop 10develop src http kernel php l 58 l58 so now i just set server http host to localhost to avoid the error 
no it s stored via relational tables a stream has many tabs name order and each tab has a single layout and each layout has many field assignments id order required 
not sure what you mean by back end software but the disk has an s 3 s3 source which may be a factor 
pulled develop 23develop again still getting the same error also tried a fresh clone of the branch as well as downloading a zip

i don t think so because i can see the params in the logfile the querystring and the parameter hash are equal the only difference that i can see are the sql statements that are shown with log level debug and other timing values 
nope there are no updates when loading the page in production mode 
migrations are suposed to not be rewrited if rewrited the up to be inert and print a warning then there will be a diference across machines in some of them it has run with content and others have run without so in some of them the down method will work and the other will not then the difference have to be corrected manualy migrations are suposed to ease the handling of problems like diferences across machines the down method is missused in the current working of migrations because they are only used in development machines when not commited on git this feature will enhance migrations usefullness for helping in this complex edge cases also will ease rolling back migrations commited witch is a more common situation and will not add any hassle in not problems environment may be because i m a beginer with rails bad migrations result in a problem and i should learn the correct way i should but i think i m not the only beginer and this will make simplier to start with rails commited bad migrations are a common beginer problem 
fixed thanks jos 
got it repeated calls are faster using read write because there is an in memory cache for the read operation but not for the fetch multi operation i m going to try to implement the in memory cache for this to have the same benefits and open a pr

thanks gmile i thought pull requests are not viewed in issues so my mistake i ve created pull request with this commit so i m closing this issue 
here is my test app with log and all included https github com edison rails test helper error
duffyjp don t think so sprockets is at 37 after rails 5 upgrade so still uses assets rb to declare all the assets we actually want compiled 
rafaelfranca if i understood documentation right existence of methods which came from joined table and specialist id was an example of such method was a reason to mark scopes with joins as read only but now when query doesn t return fields from joined table by default there is no reason to set readonly flag on those records on the contrary when scope uses explicit select clause records probably should be marked as readonly 
nope it straight authlogic with the following helpers https gist github com 1003373 my spec helper https gist github com 1003383 my request spec https gist github com 1003385 my user session model https gist github com 1003387 my factories https gist github com 1003388 it was working till i upgraded to 31 last week i have tried quite a few work arounds with no luck yet 
so the response header is set correctly the body content encoding should be relevant i suppose how otherwise can you render non ascii symbols when the string itself is always ascii 
since the count in this context is used to determine whether the rows exist or not include doesn t need count btw the following can be executed select count 1 from blogs or count this doesn t need any select values whatsoever except when distinct is used could you please explain why all of the select values are being put into the count anyway i see your point re too magical but i don t agree with it rails used to delegate include and others to array so it was simply fetching the records now rails decided not to do this anymore and execute proper sql query to return the result of include and friends but since those methods require the use of aggregate functions it is not just as simple as wrapping it in a count if rails has decided to go that route it needs to take into account the semantics otherwise it is just being a string builder for sql there are a few scenarios for using count 1 count column name  number of non null values from column name 2 count distinct column name  number of distinct values on column name 3 count or count 1 number of records the intention of using count in this particular example is to return the number of records scenario 3 but rails uses count with incorrect semantics what appears to be the scenario 1 to return number of non null values on a particular column i understand that it is easier to just close the issue but if rails has decided to support the translation of aggregate methods such as include it should apply correct semantics to it or otherwise do not support it and users will make no assumptions about it i respect your decision on closing the issue but i hope you see my point could you please reconsider it and discuss this internally 
indeed java jar jruby complete jar 162jar s gem install rails pre version rc 4 308rc4 does work but java jar jruby complete jar 162jar s gem install rails pre version rc 3 308rc3 and java jar jruby complete jar 162jar s gem install rails pre do not work i guess the later is due the yaml in rc 3 rc3 gem i guess fir the released version things are on save side 
this show case works fine with x 30x i have this problem after i upgrade one of my project
bundler says using sprockets 281 i hope that s the information you seek and yes i used 328 prior to rc 2 329rc2
thank you for you efforts just figured out that it has been resolves in the new rc 4 rc4
sure i have in the application js since dom tree was changed by j query jquery ui that s why i ve got requests for image assets i didn t think i have to mention that 
pull request https github com rails rails pull 11913 created 
i can give it a try
well the path to my actual use case is long d i ll try and keep it to the relevant steps 1 an active record activerecord model has a field of home city and away city 2 i then use i n i18n to get a translation on home city at away city this returns a safe buffer safebuffer 3 then i call titlecase on the returned object because in some situations cities aren t capitalized in the model 4 this last call is in view and throws an exception

no edit node path doesn t require an argument let me see if i can make the problem clearer imagine i have two resources tree and node in the show view for tree i render a collection of nodes using shared node html erb which looks something like this  each of these including edit takes me to the correct page for the node being rendered by the partial so far so good now imagine i call the show action for node a the show action for a node also renders a collection of node partials using the same view nodes d and e are children of node a so from a s show page i can see nodes d and e each with the same three links as i saw for a the show and delete links for d and e are correct but clicking the edit links for either d or e will take me to the edit action for a since edit node path by default works correctly for node a but not d and e i believe that when not given arguments edit node path will first try to link to the resource referenced by the variable node if node is nil edit node path will then try to link to the resource referenced by the variable node as far as i can tell edit node path will only require an argument if neither variable exists my concern is that this behavior is inconsistent if the show and destroy links within the partial for a resource call the show and destroy actions for the partial s resource why should the edit link be any different 
well i suppose either the link tag should be output or rails should explicitly indicate that it doesn t support such a thing in mailers as it is it seems like an oversight inlining the css could be handy too perhaps i m don t have so much experience with creating html emails so i can t say for sure 
will i be sure that nothing from application css scss is included in pages css scss and vice versa that way 
i m willing to take it on a deadline at the moment but i should have time to revisit in a week or so 
rafaelfranca i think that would be fine other solutions i ve thought of would be blacklist app javascript or ensure there is at least one rb in the directory 
gchan foo bar is not nil after the save foo bar baz is nil 
apologies if its a noob question i tried moving aside the tmp directory but it still fails in chrome works elsewhere perhaps i should upgrade rake 
never got the comment by rafaelfranca thanks gringocl verified fixed

https github com changs rspec problem
rafaelfranca i didn t mean that people are using this class specifically that s why it s private but that having configuration attributes is very common for libraries does that make sense 
sqlite 3 sqlite3 was still mentioned in the gemspec but it looks like it s no longer the case with rc 5 rc5 so i think you may close this issue 201186 spastorino reply reply github com 
nope didn t know 325 was out thanks for pointing that out on the rails blog it says 324 was just released 
rc 8 310rc8
maybe but today i wrote something like this user posts empty  user commented posts present and was really surprised with the generated queries as i don t want to iterate over these collections or count them at all 
carlosantoniodasilva rails 328
i m using the fedora 15 32 bit tomorrow will show the app with problem replicated 
i think rails must be available for commands like generate destroy etc with or without test directory edit i prefer rspec instead of test units this is why i create my plugins with t flag
can you use this https github com rails rails pull 3125 
it s the same sql in both cases in fact i changed it so the fast query is the slow one to sql which is then executed via active record activerecord select rows in the slow case i guess it creates objects for each row and that s why is x 10x slower is that expected behavior 
the first problem i encountered was with the active record transaction method in both rails 30 and 31 this form of the call no longer works  what is strange is that in other controllers i m using the first form successfully but it fails in one particular controller the name of the table model is heist which i can t imaging being a reserved word ah ha i see the problem i have a model name with the same name as the application and that is causing active record methods to not be available on the base model name i ll change the name of my app and that will fix the problem but it does seem strange that such a namespace collision can exist 
you re right it was actually a bug in the routing filter gem which was causing rails to not loop through the routes properly if a constraint failed 
carlosantoniodasilva thank you for the clear explanation i understand the original issue happens just with ruby 187 but the next rails probably 4 will not support ruby 187 this fix is not required i m going to open a pull request for 32 branch 
attempted to perform git bisect at b a eb fa d b cdfc c ac 009b2a54344eb2463fa4018d9b20cdfc4c0495ac and found this test never runs successfully with sqlite mem sqlite3mem 
rafaelfranca ill notify my students of this issue because they are all experiencing it at this time thus i have them to hold off on using rails c and related commands until the issue is resolved thanks for the feedback to this issue 
using the greedy regex works as a workaround but it s still odd there s a different behavior when using the same regex with resources match 
opened a pr on global id globalid here https github com rails globalid pull 109
al o cr al2o3cr got the point there gonna post logging result as soon as i manage to get some free time btw more investigation leads me that issue could be because of vagrant box everything that goes with it as this app is running on vagrant box 
yeah that works except one case  the no method error nomethoderror would be triggered on arbitrary object even and no method error nomethoderror name would be even which would lead to the same erroneous behavior 
the whole point about this group assets is that i don t require asset gems in production environment in fact it would be even better if they even not existed in load path when they are not required by bundler requiring these gems is just the same as not putting them into this group and doesn t look like a solution 
ok will do 
the problem is that when i copy paste the weird character it changes from square symbol and becomes  so i ll have to either find a way to enter this character with a special keyboard combination some kind of alt some key or its ascii code 
i only tried it in rails 423 and it didn t work re fix i m afraid i cannot commit the time at the moment i wouldn t even know where to start i d be happy to provide any additional info necessary 
i made some more test if i remove this gem https github com flyerhzm switch user rails s at least does not brakes on start up any suggestion on what do i have to look into the code to patch it 
this is weird i do not know where my application can cause this issue i will try to debug 
while i agree that https github com rails rails issues 6810 issuecomment 6483000 is more of a feature than a bug this on the other hand sounds more like a bug to me than an actual feature 
hi george congrats and thanks for becoming a member of the core team okay in application rb i had restricted the required frameworks so action text wasn t included  i changed that to just require rails all and the action text install task showed up it looks like there isn t a railtie for action text so what do i include 
i don t now but if there is a problem with security the first option is better but there is any problem with silence the warning 
here is the full trace thanks 
i believe render body plain etc is only available at 41 right 
please tell me you re not serious first of all this behaviour is mentioned nowhere maybe there should be a hint of this being intended in oh the official documents i mean just look at http guides rubyonrails org testing html unit testing your models there s no mention of a line like assertion at c ruby lib ruby192lib ruby gems gems 191gems activesupport lib 313lib active support testing setup and teardown rb in 35in block in run after this  that s what it s supposed to look like according to the docs there s also no mention of rake exploding after that secondly i m pretty sure that there is some way to stop execution of a chain of commands in a proper manner instead of letting it simply look like your application just exploded thirdly it seems as if the rubymine ide does not look stuff exploding in this way either since that way i only get a list of whatever broke first and not all the errors i don t like this piecemeal approach to be honest fourthly when i was using rails 2 i also don t remember exploding unit tests 
i tested it against master with postgre sql postgresql 920 pg 0141 i think the problem is not rails specific but comes from the difference between the date function in my sql mysql and pg sql pgsql because this works fine in pg sql pgsql 
it looks like it s no longer an issue in 32 as it appears the default order by is gone ruby p 180 192p180 015 user select id to sql select id from users  and except is working ruby p 180 192p180 020 user select id order version id except order to sql select id from users  thanks
i ve tried to reproduce this error in a new application without success but i ve managed to find a way to repeat it in the original app if that s any help to you the problem appears when there s an exception thrown in another controller the execution chain is broken could be anything like  after that publisher base controller basecontroller seems to be invisible to rails undefined method current publisher if i make a change to any controller file can be as simple as adding a space saving the file rails reloads the code and the error disappears now i m not sure whether it s a problem with rails or with one of the gems we re using just can t track down this sucker i ll keep on trying with a sample app anyway just thought i d post an update first 
i ve posted an app with tests https github com wtn db config injection app blob master test db setup test rb that demonstrate the behavior if you can please reopen this issue i would appreciate it to clarify running a rake database task for a rails app from the command line results in the database config file being read at three points 1 rake calls active record activerecord tasks database tasks databasetasks setup initial database yaml here https github com rails rails blob a e f efe d da dd e f e d e activerecord 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6activerecord lib active record railties databases rake l 5 l5 2 active record activerecord configures its databases here https github com rails rails blob a e f efe d da dd e f e d e activerecord 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6activerecord lib active record railtie rb l 210 l210 3 rake re configures active record activerecord here https github com rails rails blob a e f efe d da dd e f e d e activerecord 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6activerecord lib active record railtie rb l 41 l41 here https github com rails rails blob a e f efe d da dd e f e d e activerecord 6a6e3f6efe9d621543da77dd3e9f1e875778d4e6activerecord lib active record railties databases rake l 19 l19 my issue is with point 3 rake does not need to force a change when active record activerecord is already configured and reinitializing is the less expected choice under rails the rake tasks work as long as active record activerecord is configured point 2 i acknowledge that my approach looks unconventional at first but is simple and works with the current public api i hope that you will give some consideration to customized but valid database configurations as the api evolves thanks for your work on multiple databases support and i appreciate your continuing leadership regarding this interface 
i ll see if i can come up with something if you re still not convinced but take a look at https github com rails rails blob master activerecord lib active record connection adapters abstract query cache rb l 71 l71 you ll see that the object that makes its way into the queries collection for exec explain is created on that line never is the bind key filled in the bug is either here not including binds or the explain stuff not checking for nil i d guess this is because the cache only stories post binded queries so there are never any binds you ll find that the queries logged by https github com rails rails blob master activerecord lib active record connection adapters abstract adapter rb l 274 l274 do in fact fill in when there are no binds which is why this doesn t barf on all queries alternatively i don t fully understand how the query cache querycache works but if the query is cached why is the explainer ever even coming into play

hi i can t reproduce this even by re running the same code where this error happened before but regarding to the place where the error happen  in other words the error happen when callings to sql arel nil i don t know this place in rails well but something like binds  or binds  will solve the problem because current default value doesn t work properly and makes no sense 
sure will do now 
i feel like the default scope should be included but instead of being part of the join clause on be appended to the where clause 
thank you i did ask in stack overflow stackoverflow did not get a response so decided to ask here 
but i ve seen this issue also in x 30x and x 31x if i find the time i will try to reproduce this with 323 and add an example to reproduce it it might also be some side effect of devise or other dependencies i thought it s worth adding as a bug cause i ve seen it happening multiple times and others might stumble over this too 
fyi on my project i decided to convert everything to time with zone timewithzone because with date times datetimes i was having issues with the time zone when converting them to unix timestamps

i m not able to test right now on 32 i am aware that the structure dumping was changed significantly from 31 to 32 so i hope this bug did not get copied over i ll go ahead an close this issue and report a new one if i ever test with 32 in case anyone needs a workaround this did the trick for me in the rakefile of the engine not the dummy application s rakefile

you re fast i tested this in ruby 193 and jruby with 19 i also hit this issue with both rails 316 and 326 my pwd is usr local share workspace and cd foo ls al yields 
mauricio the application has two database connections i have an application database plus about three models that are used to get data from a separate data warehouse database 
this test is trivial so even going to 100000 does not exceed m 500m rsize tested but absolutely 0 of the k 100k records are getting gc d i also tested several combinations of gc enable and gc start in all cases regular object got gc d and model objects that got new d got gc d model objects that got created failed to get gc d no matter what combination when run in rails 4 rails4 some percentage of the created objects get gc d when gc commands are not used as one would expect the 1000 number is down from my initial tests using k 10k just for the sake of speed it was clear that rails 4 rails4 gc d some of the created models in the 1000 case 
yes also got this this problem but i found that new project without my additions to rakefile works fine here is my rakefile is it correct way to extend rake tasks or maybe i am wrong 
as you wish here is it 
schneems i found that this only happens when you run rake db schema load within the base folder of a rails engine once i learned that i had to run it within the test dummy it worked fine i am going to close this issue but if you want i can provide more info 
pftg yes the output is the same on rc 3 401rc3
rails generated applications default to sqlite 3 sqlite3 activerecord mysql adapter mysql2adapter is the gem rails recommends installing when a mysql adapter is not present however errors occure when rake db migrate is used with the activerecord mysql adapter mysql2adapter gem mysql 2 mysql2 gem doesn t have these problems 
yes executes extra queries 
in my case profile was just the association defined as 
yep this was 328
yes i do have a correct generated path i e  admin restaurants customers 12customers 3 with polymorphic path and as well with url for

i am using rails 328 i ll try to verify next week 
i ve tried 403 and rc 1 410rc1
both for rails 30 and rails 32 i created rails app rails new test app command created a controller rails g controller users added it to routes and defined users controller userscontroller index method  then i ran it using puma puma b tcp 00008888 e production 
sorry was assuming i d be uploading that once the issue was created but didn t see a spot if you apply the patch from the gist below to a freshly generated rails 329 app it should get you there https gist github com 4069112 rails new testapp cd testapp patch p 0 p0 patch txt
updated to 206 problem remains
it does not happen with regular app controllers i haven t checked other gems with controllers that inherit from application controller active admin activeadmin controllers are generated on startup demand i am not clear on how const unloading reloading works with inheritance when the base changes does rails need to unload all subclasses i suppose that if it does it s impossible to unload and reload controllers that are not file based 
actually this was probably never intended what was likely intended is to mimic template renderer templaterenderer and allow the partial to provide content for content slot to the layout which the layout would render with yield content slot that requires that the partial be rendered first however this too is broken as the yield args from the layout are discarded i am not sure what s more useful having the partial render first and provide content to the layout or for the layout to render first and influence the rendering of the partial perhaps both styles should be supported via an option currently neither is whoever designed this should provide some insight 
i don t see it defining a new block it stores the passed block in block and ignores it you can see render partial utilizing the block  but collection with template ignores it 
1 this side effect that was there probably from the beginning of form field helpers 2 as to whether it s unwanted how can you possibly believe that a lossy join  is better than a lossless to s effectively json as i mentioned you can t reliably parse values out of a join a b c d 
the problem of relation include needlessly loading the relation just to check for membership this problem was already solved for associations there is of course a workaround exists but include is the canonical ruby rails way to check for membership so it should work as well as exists 
i am new to rails if i give the command bundle install trace it still fails where can i find the stacktrace 
t column like we use t string t binary can we use t longblob in rails 4 or t blob
fxn thank you it works i ll send a pr to update the doc
yes am s default is false but ar s default is true
test https gist github com nleo 10404789
i tested it using 3210 3211 and 3212 same problem changed to ruby 193 and started to work 
if to remove dependent destroy it then issues update statement which is destructing as well also tries rails x 30x it issues update statement always 
the stack trace
same thing happens with a has many so just used that since i know how to get the generated sql 
thanks for the try rafael i ll look into adding the test from ar jdbc into ar but it might take me a day or two i m kind of finishing up with a 40 compatible release 
sure i ll reference this issue 
it s the same code but the way in which options are passed through is different here https github com rails rails blob d d d adea ad ec ca d a f actionview 84650022d574d24d6adea6ad941ec3ca57d2a2f0actionview lib action view helpers tag helper rb l l 241 l235l241

sure i just wanted to make sure it was documented but i can t reproduce it  brian mc manus mcmanus
rafaelfranca rspec the same test suite runs fine on top of beta 1 400beta1 the setting use transactional fixtures true is being ignored our current workaround is 
sorry i gave a bad example here s a simple example https github com graduss sample git the problem appears when uploading large files 
sure that s my example app https github com apat test app
pftg and dmathieu i ve updated the issue with versions tested i ve created a sample application that address this issue https github com kevin sjoberg kevinsjoberg rails console helper bug 
ruby p 0 210p0 20131225 revision 44422 x linux x8664linux trace is a little bit too long 2000 lines so i ll put it to http vpaste net w vk 8w5vk note that i stripped couple of lines from there which are related to my project and it s private sorry 
sweet thanks a lot senny 
no i don t i believe this could be the cause but since i am mentioning the name attribute in the method and providing a value to it the record should be created with the attribute both methods find or create by and first or create should behave the same way 
good to know thanks the only initializer i have that might try is the rails admin initializer but i m telling it to blacklist the contract model https gist github com willc de food willc0de4food b ae bc bbe eb 9 786b86ae8bc8bbe27eb9

just imagine the method is defined in a gem you use if you want it really doesn t matter what matters is that if such method exists the result is more then problematic 
for the same reason that you d wrap something in a transaction even though the parent call also happens to be in a transaction several layers up keeping the call close to the code that must be transactional ensures that that code is always protected regardless of how the calling code changes or the called code is used in different places in the future for the includes case imagine a low level helper method that eager loads an association and does something with it it makes sense to put the includes call in that helper rather than repeated in many places that construct the initial relation and call the helper but this behavior means that if any of those places also happen to eager load the same association for some other purpose than what the helper is doing duplicate queries will occur in general it seems to be restrict code re use in a complex application high level methods doing eager loading need to ensure that no lower level methods ever repeat the same eager loading on the same relation object and low level methods adding eager loading to a passed relation object need to ensure that nowhere up the chain also added the same eager loading considering how transaction works it surprised me that includes is not aware of when an association has already been included

thanks robin 850 robin850 for the comment it does really look from the source though that rails is trying to support the postgres money datatype as there is explicit code to cope with it in the connection adapters connectionadapters module of postgresql adapter rb it may not be used that often though hence my discovery of the issue craig
yes sure i will just give me some time to prepare a sample code at github i will upload sample code but i can t provide full code of app i am working on 
i have also tried and it yields the same results as eql 
sample app https github com cannie sampleapp when i go to http localhost 3000 i see correct output as i expected 
yes the index name should change i first found this in 3215 and the primary key constraint would also be lost you would get a new db schema rb file with but it looks like in 401 this doesn t happen anymore and it s only the index name that is wrong thanks 
i tried creating a new rails app with the same before filter that causes the infinite loop but don t manage to reproduce the issue any hint on what to check on my app 
https gist github com werner c e ffc 01 6c6560495099e29ffc01
senny i ve created the following gist including my test case https gist github com rcook 7670071 it turns out that this only happens when using the postgre sql postgresql database adapter sqlite 3 sqlite3 doesn t exhibit this behaviour i ve also updated the title of this issue to reflect this if this bug should be filed elsewhere e g the bug tracker for the pg gem please let me know and i ll move it 
it s mime rss 
rafaelfranca the sql generated by to sql is incorrect the sql statement only selects from collections but it filters by things collection id if i try to run it 
senny i tried writing the executable test case and could not reproduce the error i then tried creating a rails project and was able to reproduce it however i was only able to reproduce it using ruby mine rubymine if i start web rick webrick from command line the error disappears i m guessing i should report this to jet brains jetbrains thanks for your help

will try over the next day or two the change to the code itself is almost certainly trivial i m just not sure where to put the test railties test application runner test rb looks like where current tests for this are not railties test commands have i got that right 
thank you
in a typical controller spec i might call  it wasn t quite as ugly back when i could just pass a hash to with 
i ve just tried rc 1 404rc1 and the problem still exists works i tried to test on beta 1 410beta1 but other gems in my project then had failed dependencies 
i m sorry i have been caught up in another project mikedhart if you could provide a sample app i m glad to see i m not the only one facing this issue i d be really thankful 
well as the gist shows when you call model column for attribute aliased attribute name it returns null column nullcolumn or nil in 40 whereas it would be nice if it returned the same thing as model column for attribute original attribute name in my case i m building a rails app on legacy db shared with some other app so i use alias attribute a lot the thing is i don t want any other code apart from the model itself to know that the actual column is named differently aliased attribute names work for create update etc they don t work for find where and pluck but this can be worked around using scopes custom finders etc but i consider column for attribute a part of the introspection api which is why i think it should take attribute aliases into consideration 
o k i published the project on github diospi test uninitialized constant proyecto all you have to do is go to the page cb axientos new and press the save button and the error comes i found out that i used the method proyecto twice in models cb axiento det rb belongs to proyecto in modules axiento dets autocomplete methods rb method proyecto
rafaelfranca sory for the late answer i ve been away for a few days n seems to do the trick on my test app but in my application it doesn t work so i started searching for the problem and found out that installing the influxdb rails gem destroys the live functionality so this doesn t seems to be a rails problem it s a influxdb rails problem 
kuldeepaggarwal oh ok how can i parse the date string in the correct time zone 
prathamesh sonpatki thanks i don t know why not probably a browser thing this code runs in production i never saw a problem on rails 4
i don t know the project where this is from is over k 20k lines of code and since i don t know much about rails class caching mechanism i don t how deep i have to go to build a meaningful standalone application reproducing the error now i inquired a bit futher in the rb files where i include the module if i remove the require relative incrementable rb the problem disappears which for me isn t terrific since i need the require for my mini test minitest environnment i found a hack to still be able to run the app without class caching i simply add a defined check  i hope it helps i can forward further info if needed 
sgrif yes but this particular test case is for test main thread variable in enumerator 
thanks for the quick response indeed i see now that this issue is resolved on master apparently by commit f e bc ad fa c a a 5 218105f58e30bc9487ad59fa455878c35262a0a5 
i m so far unable to reproduce the problem when i try to boil it down to a script but i am still looking into it 
hash conditions active record also allows you to pass in hash conditions which can increase the readability of your conditions syntax with hash conditions you pass in a hash with keys of the fields you want conditionalised and the values of how you want to conditionalise them note only equality range and subset checking are possible with hash conditions also this https github com rails docrails commit f daf c e efa ce fac 56281210020 50f79daf593c61e43efa8ce549fac56281210020
 both d bs dbs legacy and current have a table called users 
maclover 7 maclover7 please delete this issue it is invalid sorry 
as in did previous versions of rails have this feature i don t think it did but that s only because i never ran into it before as in did this feature work before this change it worked for single objects in both the form render layout layout name locals object object do end and render layout object do end it might seem a little out of place but it s very useful when partials have very small differences between them or have a form input in them as you don t have to pass in the form object to the partial and it keeps all the form code in one file so personally i ve been wanting a feature like this for a while 
strangely i can t replicate it with a test script either but here s a basic app https github com georgemillo rails issue demo 23241demo that replicates the error pull it run the migrations open up the console and try m model new created at time now just to confirm i m getting this error with ruby mri 230 on a mac and that app is loading rails at commit dfab ca 23 6dfab475ca23
i ve been doing my development in my sql mysql i m working on getting sq lite sqlite installed so i can reproduce the problem with it i was planning on posting the source of the test case app i ve been working on once i get it a little more cleaned up i m most of the way there i think that would be faster easier for me than figuring out that bug report template would my approach be as useful or nearly so as using the bug report template 
it ended up being that uglifier had been removed from the gemfile from mistake 
it doesn t matter whether i don t set autosave or set it to false or true i still behaves this way updated code that works as expected if you have a database set up accordingly 
i can t seem to is there an api to add a record to a habtm relationship without issuing a query i followed the advice on http stackoverflow com questions add 13197359add association without commiting to database which suggested using add to target on fri dec 5 2014 at 439 pm sean griffin notifications github com wrote 
unfortunately the project where i have the issue is not open source i have a rails application i can try to upgrade and see if it reproduces the issue but it s not sure i ll let you know 
here s the stack trace 
tenderlove i will try to get an example posted back soon 
sgrif please check out https github com dandlezzz attribute will change bug i think my inline comments will explain things well enough i guess i am using the method not as it was intended but i can verify that this did work in previous versions so it would be nice to fix if possible thanks so much for your help we are upgrading our app to 42 and have almost no issues and really enjoy the features

you guys are right it was a cache problem the reason it was not loading thanks for the help 
you re totally right but i m pretty new to rails and figured that i might let it to someone who would use better words than me to describe that behavior i haven t looked at any part of the code yet so i can t be sure that what i would describe would be completely right some day i hope i ll know enough about rails to contribute actively but for now i m not too comfortable with it
confirmed it s still an issue with active support activesupport 600
ptashman it s less that i want to look up a non existent object and more that i d rather the issue was handled by my validation rather than erroring out immediately often we assign association id values from a user form or api to a model for example person update attributes params require person allow name role id if the role id is out of range that should be able to be returned to the user via a validation error eg role does not exist no need to reveal too much about our database rather than resulting in a 500
what s wrong exactly with the documentation http api rubyonrails org classes active record activerecord connection adapters connectionadapters schema statements schemastatements html method i add column is it the whole statement or only a part of it furthermore i find it useful to be able to pass options such as index true to add column are you sure that is only documentation that needs to be fixed and not the code 
rafaelfranca sure i will try to do this
sgrif i updated the gist and set the gems to use the master branch i reran the program and i can still reproduce the issue 
is it i misunderstand the parameter start day will not override the config beginning of week it is just ask the day of previous week not set the beginning of week to be the day 
that s weird but it worked smile 
sure but writing an amf request could take some time i ll report back when i have a good test code 
returns a blank line
probably the output of db schema dump shouldn t come when we run the migrations with db migrate this question on stackoverflow http stackoverflow com questions odd 28955822odd rake dbmigrate output has some discussion on it too

hello senny thank you for replying imagine this scenario 1 two days ago a mate wrote a migration to add a reference column fk  in my view add reference method does not have more useful options such as reference table name or column name to customise the column and fk created

hy hansondr thanks for the help i confirm the script triggers the same error 
i don t have any integration test right now i m still working at controller level however i ve found out that it works actually kind of if i pass both params and body keywords  i e it seems that if parameters are passed in a post request request raw post is populated accordingly the inverse is not true in my case i cannot pass parameters because signature is computed against the raw body string and passing it as parameter hash keep values but not the order of them in raw body

yes i will try to replicate it on a sample app the problem is when using a older dump of the database it works but when tried to use connect on production or get production dump and import locally it stops working ps database doesn t uses view 
sorry close this my brain is fried today 
i am not getting any error not in js neither in rails console just the thing that the speak function is not being called when i try to submit a form which is in the channel but if i explicitly run from browser console it works then it also starts working from the ui
maclover 7 maclover7 thank you for response you helped me debugging and solved my issue i created a gist https gist github com haslinger b b e ba 33196 b08b473e63574ba33196 that proved me wrong the response is correct what misled me was that i was using wget for testing the response that doesn t load the body for the status 422 case while curl does it correctly thank you for your time 
ok thank you 
i ll try and report here maclover 7 maclover7
guilleiguaran this gives me the same error nothing changed
thanks for the suggestion y yagi were currently employing that as a workaround but it means adding a new column is a two deploy process first deploy adds the soon to be added column to ignored columns and then another deploy to add the column in a migration and remove the column name from ignored columns were hoping to avoid having to spread this over two deploys to get zero downtime 
i ll see if i can carve out a bit of time to do a pr 
alright i have a feeling that this was a reasonable request designed to uncover the root of the problem i spun up a fresh machine installed rails copied the templates to lib templates erb scaffold ran rails generate scaffold class name string and it worked changes were carried through to the generated view what troubleshooting steps are suggested to track this down on the machine with the issue on that machine rails 5 was installed as an rvm gemset loosely following http railsapps github io updating rails html 
robin 850 robin850 thanks for reply i can create pr soon 
rafaelfranca yes indeed it works with v rc 1 v500rc1 so probably this won t be fixed in 42 just out of curiosity do you know why this works in rails 5
i do not just an update i restarted all of the v ms vms and in this case turning it off and back on seemed to resolve the issue we can mark this matter as closed 
for me that is a questions should this be fixed in rack or in action pack actionpack 
i generated application with rails new rails playground successfully but running bin rails c fails with similar error details  details thought that an issue with my ruby installation but apps like irb work well 
untitled zip untitled1zip https github com rails rails files untitled zip 341966untitled1zip if you run this project and go to http localhost examples 3000examples you will see a blank page however if you delete line 26 in untitled app untitled1app views examples index html erb which is  todo testing with no spaces or other characters after the you will then see listing examples new example this shows that an injected remark with no spaces will cause a blank page to display 
rafaelfranca the problem seems to be inside the postgresql adapter how would one use the adapter in the template test cases it seems to be requiring me to create the database unlike sqlite 3 sqlite3 which works inline
maclover 7 maclover7 it could be but i m not really sure the issue here is i have an array of hashes and i know all values are passed since they are there but for some reason the hashes are merged into one if i try to work with the params in a controller action the array always has just one hash rather than what was actually sent i m not really sure if its strong parameters related since an integration test works fine which is weird since that uses more of the full rails stack when it comes to controller tests i don t know how much stubbed under the hood my guess is strong parameters is the same in both which makes this weirder either way this replicates what i noticed after upgrading to rails 5 without any changes but again this only happened to me when the params contained an array of hashes it doesn t seem to happen in other cases 
i was trying to serialize request env in sinatra and found it a ok when only requiring json but bugs when requiring active support so introducing active support just breaks the existing code right 
the column type is datetime haven t had the time for a demo app yet 
maclover 7 maclover7 unfortunately i don t think that would do much good as we ve only seen it once and i don t have any way of reproducing it we saw another constant loading error recently but it was in the aws sdk gem so seems unrelated 
rafaelfranca i figured out why it broke but i would argue that allowing lazy fulfillment inside a transaction block is a bad idea it could easily lead to people s intended concurrency controls being broken without their realizing it

thank you mechanicles for quick response i ve checked and my model and i can confirm that it doesn t have optional true attribute however if i set up up with required attribute  in fact i get expected behaviour  status 422 error unprocessable entity exception  active record activerecord record invalid recordinvalid validation failed author must exist however seeting required true restricts me from nullifying author for the post on updates and one of the requirements is ability to set author of the post to null is there a way to validate foreign key object only if author id is not null that way i could only allow for author id to be null or be a valid id 
i m not aware of an option to change the dump format where can i see what format rails is using thus i am certain that i m using the default format 
sure i ve been using rails for years but never contributed to core so i d be happy to i ll read the how to contribute and take a crack at it 
okey here you go https gist github com praveenkumarsinha a e ba e f c cff f d 03 a0e77684ba12e69f6c02cff2f2197d03
monday i will try to replicate it in my test app 
sure 
where can i find logs for this error there is no indication of what is going on i can t find anything that could be causing this i ve already reinstalled ruby rvm tryied to upgrade ruby version nothing makes the app work
agreed removing the validation was actually how i got past this just wasn t expecting the presence to evaluate false nil and false rather than nil i like that defining validations self documents code and the model to some extent and there may be instances where you want someone to explicitly define a boolean field and not set a default value force thought and a decision  on wed 23 nov 2016 191803 utilum 1000utilum lt notifications github com gt wrote why do you need to validate presence if you have a default value  you are receiving this because you authored the thread reply to this email directly view it on git hub github or mute the thread 
utilum as i understand it there is no difference between 472 and 5 regarding callbacks according to http api rubyonrails org classes active record activerecord relation html method i delete delete is not expected to trigger a callback therefore i made two changes to your script marked with change lines 111 and 138 because i would not expect 0 as you wrote but 1 i added the patch for the decrement counter for the active record to the test script as well see patch in script file with the patch all changed tests run through as i would expect them to changed test script see https gist github com otux b cc a a d e ed 469522 43b963cc48312a6099a8d7e8ed469522
sorry for the delay here is the example project https github com johan smits rails add foreign key there are 2 commits one after bundle update to the 60 version and one after rails migrate

after further investigation it turns out an ill conceived monkey patch in my app affecting arrays was to blame thank you for your time and bringing my attention to the reproduction scripts 
checked out the test database in rails 425 as rafaelfranca pointed out it worked in rails 42 because db test purge was called what could be the ideal work around i have added the trace of db creat for rails 42 and 50 trace from rails 425

yes https github com gamezj actioncable ec git ec2git this problem is in aws
thanks for your replies rafaelfranca and ztsuperman i read through that documentation and i ve observed it functioning as described in other controllers however it still seems to be behaving inconsistently in this particular example perhaps for reasons that ztsuperman described one because there is no model foo and two because it only does this wrapping when foo is passed as false for example doing the same reproduction steps above except curling with parameters with foo as 0 instead of false  here is a repository of the rails app i am testing with which was made using the reproduction steps in this issue https github com motevets rails param same name as controller is this a bug it seems odd that it wraps the parameters when a parameter with same name of the controller is set to false but not for any other values 
meinac i have some other projects on my machine and all are working fine except one i don t know how to debug because error info is very generic and small i cannot share that project because companies privacy policies please can you give me a hints to fix this 
yes the underlying issue is that the helper is misnamed easy to fix the problem this issue is addressing is that one way or another it is possible for to enter the load error loaderror is missing function for a load block loadblock that has path of nil causing the undefined method sub for nil nil class nilclass no method error nomethoderror error which since load error loaderror is missing is attempting to provide a useful error message seems to defeat it s purpose because this is ruby land pretty much any gem anywhere could be doing something to load error loaderror that causes path to be nil what gem and where who knows we could spend a bunch of time tracking down exactly what did it and how but that wouldn t change anything a new gem someone wrote tomorrow could pop up and do the same thing my suggestion is that it might be worth the few characters or lines to make sure load error loaderror path quacks responds to sub or is a string or whatever before telling it to and responding with something more useful if it doesn t since rails is already raising when path doesn t respond to sub there s not much harm that can be done by raising something more descriptive like expected load error loaderror to have string path but value is nil this might be because of a miss named helper i can pr this change if you like it looks like load error loaderror is missing is only called in one place https github com rails rails blob f a bf fe f d a e 310918f6a194bf5752fe1025930881756f5d8a8e actionpack lib abstract controller helpers rb l 186 l186 so the scope of the change is very minimal if the attitude is more hey this is ruby weird shit can happen anywhere at any time we can t be always checking everything everywhere then that s cool too code gets pretty ridiculous trying to account for everything in a language with next to no guarantees i just wanted to let y all know since i hit it and spent the time to debug it 
i generated a small app that reproduces the error here https github com cjlarose rails uninitialized 6uninitialized constant html repro the commit history is clean but roughly the steps were 1 rails 522 new skip sprockets skip listen repro cd repro 1 set gem rails beta 2 600beta2 in the gemfile 1 remove the web console gem from the gemfile 1 add the config gem to the gemfile 1 bundle update rails 1 bundle exec rails app update  accept changes to config appliction rb then quit 1 bundle exec rake active storage update  uninitialized constant error from debugging my own application and trying to generate this repro app i found that these two conditions are necessary 1 action controller actioncontroller base is loaded before this initializer in actiontext 0 runs 2 the gem rails html sanitizer isn t loaded before the same initializer runs 0 https github com rails rails blob v beta actiontext v600beta2actiontext lib action text engine rb l l 35 l31l35 the config gem is just one way to make sure the first condition is satisfied since it references action controller actioncontroller base explicitly in its initializer 1 1 https github com railsconfig config blob lib 170lib config integrations rails railtie rb l l 32 l26l32 removing the web console gem is necessary here to ensure the second condition is satisfied the reason that i generated the app with skip sprockets and skip listen is that it ll expand the statement to require rails all in the generated config application rb if the application uses require rails all instead of listing out the frameworks explicitly the error doesn t happen something else require s the rails html sanitizer before the actiontext initializer runs lastly the problem is a little more widespread than i thought it s not really related to bundle exec rake active storage update for example in this repro app even bin rails console fails with the same error 
i would like db schema rb to also use bigint when using references as it already happens for my sql mysql and postgre sql postgresql that way db schema rb will be the same for all adapters at least on this topic and the documentation which now says that default type is bigint will be accurate 
actual the instance of cat is doing the confusing thing now how about this 
y yagi please find a link for a new rails app here https github com mayordwells calculator math
georgeclaghorn i eventually managed to find the culprit after your suggestion of creating a sample app it turns out that i was mistakenly using this in my controller  by using post new and attach i was basically attaching each file twice which explains both the invalid signature i think and the duplicate record errors even though for some reason it was working when using direct upload false maybe the docs could have been a little more helpful on this one but it was mostly and mainly my mistake thank you for your prompt response and my apologies for wasting your time on an issue which was not a rails bug please feel free to close this one

here you go i also created an app https github com ziinfo inflect that reproduces this error
sure i ll look at adding tests for this and send a pr

glennfu if you open your web browser developer tools console you ll see that full stack trace printed out when the error happens

hey rafael i just found the cause of the issue it is not a problem in activestorage itself but more of the magic of building a url in the direct url i have posted an answer for this on stackoverflow https stackoverflow com a 571880347588447 will close this issue keep it for reference of others who might face the same thanks for your attention help
thanks for the input i ll put up a pr to update the documentation in the next couple of days

hi we have only select granted for replica user and use works it is not explicitly mentioned in mysql documentation but i think that when user is granted select privilege to some database he can also do the use statement because one can do when granted select to both db 1 db1 and db 2 db2 the query does use db 1 db1 and selects from db 2 db2 too i assume one could do use db 2 db2 also because i could not find a separate use grant type in documentation example from https dev mysql com doc refman en 57en use html 
it does indeed good to know 
it sems to happen after doing session instance variable set loaded true 
joshmn it is nil

i used mysql 2 mysql2 gem 
thanks then i try open ssh openssh i got console window with password prompt all work nice in my case no difference between which ssh clients to use  thanks again 
i don t have a public repository it happens with a private git svn repository tracking an svn origin i ll try to replicate with a public repository 
pull d http github com stan angeloff stanangeloff gitextensions commit cd bb f b a ec d 86783 1cd4309538823bb0090f84b1a197ec2182d86783
everything is false there including is dirty dir isdirtydir
no that is it then will install latest net framework thank you 
yes it was the first setting not sure when or why i enabled that thanks for the help 
yeah i m not able to reproduce but it happened i m still looking for a sure fire repro 
i am not using remote desktop i am using git 180 and git extensions gitextensions 243 net 4 on a windows 7 bit 64bit machine 
did they do i need to wait for a new release of git extensions or do i just update msysgit on its own 
i just updated to 231 the other day but hadn t checked this yet just did and it looks like it is fixed every repo i open shows the correct remote url i guess this issue can be closed 
winmerge but its the same if i set it to kdiff 3 kdiff3 no launch just on commit works if also the other one gets selected the difftool  local options in the context menu also work fine only the open with difftool fail i found the reason too internal diff uses command git cmd diff unified 3 patience m c b cbb cc fec e ac d da cd e b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e b cbb cc fec e ac d da cd e b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e  language hungarian fdres hun rc while the difftool one git cmd difftool gui no prompt m c b cbb cc fec e ac d da cd e b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e b cbb cc fec e ac d da cd e b067308cbb8cc22979fec1e6ac4d54da177cd85e language hungarian fdres hun rc note the missing around the hash the is a special character to cmd exe and must be escaped quoted or rather not used to avoid such problems ge should use 1 instead of consistently it works fine outside quotes 
no i didn t try that actually not a cmd line fan but i uninstalled and reinstalled the older gitextensions 231 and it works fine in that using same recent version of git i also tried making commits via git gui and that works fine also so i m fairly confident something broke in 232
i run putty pageant
c git
i m using version 246 i do not remember using it previously 
just fyi i reproduced this twice before i posted here but i didn t take good notes where did i get the installation etc let me reproduce it and i ll update this thread with how i found this problem it should be really easy to see then again i would have expected a lot of me too posts to this thread and i m not seeing any this makes me think the issue is on my end thanks for your continued curiosity craig p s it does look like the installer is attempting to ask or install the latest msysgit

hello i installed version 244 and could not reproduce this issue i suppose it has been fixed already regards 
sorry for the late response i currently use three different o ss oss win 7 win7 ubuntu 1204 only for testing purposes don t really care about stability so things may be broken there and some older ubuntu distro my main os with a manually compiled mono but i only built git ext gitext on the first two because my main distro is too old and i have a different checkout of the repo for each os so that shouldn t be a problem and on win 7 win7 i usually reset the repo if i should switch between vs 2012 vs2012 and xamarin studio gitextensionsv tar gitextensionsv2469415954tar gz worked with mono debug on win at least on a smaller repo hang up on the gitext repo but maybe i should have given it more time or should have waited with trying to interact with the window 
the gitattributes file came back again today i know for sure i didn t edit gitattributes running the above command gives the following output  the command did not cause gitattributes to be created so that s interesting in case it s useful on the git config page i have it set to checkout as is commit as is because we want to preserve crlf line endings 
currently running 7 ultimate on an r mbp 15 rmbp15 with 200 scaling i ll get back to you in a few hours once i reboot to 81 this has been happening for a long time but was hidden behind dpi virtualization so the program was able to function despite fuzziness recently you force disabled it in the manifest see fb a d 3 5fb8a0d3 rendering certain dialogs dysfunctional and many others very ugly 
it is obvious that i suggest to improve the algorithm so that if the line moves left at one commit and right in another then this shall be replaced by a direct line but i m not able to formulate a general solution i understand it is not easy to design such an improvement i just wanted to point out one ugly corner case of the current code 
it uses gui dialogs instead of stdin stdout for requesting things like verifying an host key or authenticating msys git msysgit s installer already looks for a tortoise plink tortoiseplink install from any existing tortoise something tortoisesomething install and will prefer it over a normal plink and it seems even git extensions does this as it selects to use tortoise svn tortoisesvn tortoise plink tortoiseplink instead of the bundled plink by default when i enabled it to use pu tty putty so why not just bundle tortoise plink tortoiseplink and default to using our own bundled copy of tortoise plink tortoiseplink instead of depending on the user installing some tortoise install and leeching of it s tortoise plink tortoiseplink to improve the user experience btw if you do bundle tortoise plink tortoiseplink and change it s exe name from plink to tortoise plink tortoiseplink the msys git msysgit installer might need to be updated to recognize that 
will do and report back manually downloading from sf now help check for updates does not show the update yet

it looks similar but i can t say much more as i m not familiar with the code internals i don t 
i have tested with a different file type so i don t think it s ssis related created new repository using git extensions in d test create new solution and add a text file save to d test changes are recorded but i can only browse the repository when the the file is open and selected in the solution explorer but all other icons are grayed out if i select the top level i e solution all buttons are active but do not work screenshot http 1http f re f0re co uk jpg 1jpg screenshot http 2http f re f0re co uk jpg 2jpg i can only commit from within git extensions gitextensions itself 
a volume is a simple windows drive letter e g c d  all volumes seem to be highlighted because they all look the same and there is no possibility to select any drive letter 
it s just a way to make sure that the commit history isn t full of dumb commits 
hi radrik 5 radrik5 ticket solved the issue i m using a too old version of git thanks a lot for your help 
pmiossec it not always happened but i ll try 
sorry it is projects teamplay git it s just the markdown removing one the commitmessage file is there with the correct message 
it happens on all repositories thanks 
jbialobr something like this screenshot from tfs image https user images githubusercontent com e 3246548335185733865178e d e df a png d79711e79525df3a25416805png basically it is just a straight line without all the lines on the side 
just as my personal opinion it would be nice to have the latest download on source forge sourceforge the download page says there are 2000 downloads of git extensions gitextensions per week from source forge sourceforge at most version 250 not the latest since it isn t available there also source forge sourceforge is under new management as of 2 years ago that claims to no longer do those things i can t vouch for their honesty https sourceforge net blog sourceforge acquisition and future plans https sourceforge net blog sourceforge acquisition and future plans edit i m obviously not speaking for my employer here i just personally found git extensions gitextensions on source forge sourceforge several years ago and hope that others will continue to be able to find it if they look there 
russ kie russkie no tags are deleted correctly 
thanks exactly what i need the only noticeable difference is that you can configure commands not only for context menu on commit in the graph but for branch context menu side bar and file context menu down 
https github com gitextensions gitextensions releases the revision graph code is rewritten in version 300 it works as i would hope in this build specifically  git extensions rc 2 3000003rc2 cbcd b c fbe f dad e cf bfa 8cbcd2b25223c73fbe9f7dad08e498cf82734bfa dirty i have not tried the 4308 build but i d be happy declaring this request resolved with new default behavior 
as references are frequently stored in the names of files in the git ref folder i would suggest picking the longest usual file name length which is 255 for both windows and linux anyone who picks a longer branch or tag name will most probably have many more issues than only a crashing git extensions gitextensions 
sorry it took so long to get back to you just tried with 3105877 and it s still happening git extensions version gitextensionsversion https user images githubusercontent com c a e ba b b cf png 824717657948161c447a280789511e99ba419b1b483cf93png 
no this is the case when there was repo created with admin rights ge was run with ordinary user rights instead of meaningful information it throws exception best regards michal kulinski
how do i verify that i have the remote repository as a remote repository i do have it as origin in the remote repositories window 
i cannot reproduce the issue myself now i tried it multiple times now incl the appveyor build and the build works the only explanation i have is that i had a incomplete plugin folder and after diffing i noticed the missing dll in the root folder of the msi and i incorrectly assumed the dll has to be in this place this can be closed in favor of 7173 sorry for the inconvenience 
from the main window of git extensions gitextensions
well i just tried again with no files to commit and indeed it crashed again twice tried with a copy of the text above i have a french windows but ge language is set to english i have no idea how to use another dictionary is it automatic and usually i don t care because i always do commit messages in english i just wanted to save temporarily a copy of this using the auto save the commit message from my po v pov it isn t important you can close it if you want the issue was created by the crash manager all the french words so not sure if your switch was effective edit tested with a fresh installation of 331 same issue edit uninstalled the version and used the portable version see 7575 same issue actually worse because the message was saved in the git commitmessage file so it crashed as soon as i wanted to do a new commit solved by emptying the file 
using git worktree list as below and grepping for branch refs heads branchname seems to do the trick 
gerhard through a bit of testing the last 10 minutes the problem only happens when my clipboard contains my ssh key this is the key contents snip when clipboard is clear clicking clone repository gives no error at all i was getting the error before the clone dialog box was showing without that key in my clipboard i receive no error thanks 
hi i start it from then desktop icon target c program files x git extensions x86gitextensions git extensions gitextensions exe start in c program files x git extensions x86gitextensions i also have gone to the target location attempted same result what i have also notice is that if i try to start it and attempt to reinstall it it barks saying its running and it cant be stopped so i stop it in the task mgr dave
hello thanks for your fast answer in our lab we develop several libraries with unit tests application tests and bindings they are git modules and they have submodules which are often dependencies that we need to build for industrial or research projects we need to develop applications that rely on one or several of our libraries in this case they are used as submodules and for simplicity we prefer having just one level of sub modules without recursivity for instance if an application depends on libraries a and b with a depending on c and d and b on d and f then we have our application as a git module depending on submodules a b c d e and f

it s unclear how to create a new site using the jekyll documentation now that i know how to do it it could ve been explained in like 4 lines on the site and saved me a couple hours somewhere it needs to say 1 in your repository in command line type jekyll new new site name 2 this cannot be accessed at username github io it must be accessed at username github io new site name it was also unclear how to install a theme which took me forever to figure out steps like this could be helpful on the site 1 find a theme you like and go to repository containing it 2 click fork in top right corner 3 add a branch called gh pages 4 go to branches tab and set gh pages as default 5 look under settings to see new url to access theme it will not be where your main files are but in a folder example url would be username github io theme name adding instructions to the site will make it ten times easier for new people to figure out how to get started with jekyll on sat aug 5 2017 at 318 am pat hawks notifications github com wrote 
i ve never had maruku parse my markdown without throwing warnings all over the place r discount rdiscount is rock solid but is based off of c extensions so i m hoping kramdown might become the defacto markdown solution for the j rubyists jrubyists i will try to cook up a patch shortly 
i m on windows but i m trying to do it in a vm with ubuntu and get all the time i m very new to ubuntu so i ll try some more things 
i m hesitant regarding whether we should be so strict and really abort in such cases i thought of producing the messages as warnings to the console but still continue but it s probably better to let the builds fail than to produce broken sites especially for git hub github pages users who probably never see the console it already happened to me several times that i browsed one of my jekyll sites and suddenly found that some tag wasn t working maybe for months without me knowing 
aiwilliams presumably your config yml specifies markdown red cloth redcloth jekyll supports a wide variety of markdown processors but maruku is the only default processor in 0110 others such as red cloth redcloth need to be installed explicitly by the user to avoid dependency bombing all jekyll users 
yeah that s not a bad compromise the links are not too long but the images are still kept organized by article 
but the blog has been converted as lt ol gt lt li gt p lt li gt lt li gt pp 3 lt li gt lt ol gt the last two list were treated as only one li
gemfile is available can you try without having bundler installed 
though encoding was already set to utf 8 recreating the file and copypasting the contents worked like charm thanks 
the default markdown renderer i suppose it is maruku i m on a fresh install of ruby and jekyll from ruby gem 
sorry for my english i think i didn t say it clear enough no i didn t changed the version of my gem i tested with jekyll 0121 file http cdn files tld just now it works i think site baseurl is another thing i use site file to define my image assets which is different from my main site url here s my setup  i defined file http images repo local in my config yml http images repo local is a localhost where i store my images on my computer  then use img href site file img png in my post to show images  when it s ready to deploy i use jekyll file http cdn files tld to change all images base url to a cdn url which is sync ed from my local repo i think it s a good idea to add a file or image or assets flag thanks 
i tried reinstalling ruby updating rubygems i even tried installing it on a windows laptop but the error is same on both i guess i ll just have to wait to build my jekyll blog and host it on github yeah i ll be updating my mint soon 
the gem version is jekyll 102 the other required gems are also in sync with the versions used by git hub github my website is running fine locally but i am not able to serve it via git hub github aniket on mon may 13 2013 at 809 am zach notifications github com wrote 
i see i didnt know that and yes i have a index html in my blog folder and it only generates page regardless
that s a great idea dropping plugins into the plugin folder encourages inlining dependencies but is easy to use the plugins ext rb pattern is confusing to me and only gets worse when you mix and match something like 1 add gems to your gemfile 2 install gems 3 require gems in config yml is way better and easy enough that it could be the default recommendation i like that this would let you switch which gems you re requiring by switching cascading config files 
just follow the error message guidelines http www nngroup com articles error message guidelines by jakob nielsen i do it for years in addition to regular messages i would suggest some jekyll specific things 1 if you need the logo even here change the top logo in a recognizable manner e g remove the red liquid always base encode 64encode it 2 dont forget to ask for help 
i use sublime text but after checking my files it appears that the english ones have encoding set in us ascii sounds to be the root cause of the problem according to the warning message i guess this issue is resolved i d re open it in case the problem still appear when i ll do the migration but i think you re right thanks a lot for helping have a nice day cheers 
responsive is how i code i was giving an example my use for this was to make an xml copy of each page such that i can make a pjax http pjax heroku com like system for my jekyll site instead of using a different header request use a different file i believe this could have many helpful uses including accessibility developing custom ap is apis for viewing content and beta testing of themes 
i plan to use jekyll for a project documentation my documentation is structure in several guide and module each of them have subnavigation so i have one default layout for the styles one by module defining a main navigation and one by guide to define the subnavigation i think it s easier to be able to have each guide layout in a module folder right now i have everything in the same folder and it s a mess 
hey sorry about it restart my computer really solve the problem thanx
yes i set baseurl to project name blog in my case as recommended on http jekyllrb com docs github pages and have read access to the folder i m not sure how to check if we brick webrick has access but presume it does since it s creating the file within site 
yeah the really simple trick is to store an empty array emptyarray  in config yml so each time we need a empty array to work with push or unshift we just have to do  assign myarray site empty array emptyarray 
i reproduce it 1 on github pages with jekyll 240 repo https github com djacquel jekyll collections test and preview http pygmeeweb com jekyll collections test  site collections col returns a collection with all attributes 2 locally using ruby 218 and jekyll 302 we clearly see that site collections col returns nothing 
https gist github com mattwillmott 6398509 hopefully that s what you were asking for 
no i haven t should i 
i think it s a great idea but i d not call them renderers because i think it s confusing for a newcomer to understand that a renderer transforms the content of a file while a converter renders the final file we could call them transformers but actually i think that limits them conceptually really we re getting a context and some raw content and doing stuff then returning some other content we re imagining that doing stuff involves transforming the content but we might be doing anything logging the number of keywords to a database for example so really we re talking about processors but i could see an argument that anything a processor could do that didn t involve transformation should really belong in a generator i m on the fence if we want a more focused type of plugin transformer is a good name if we want a more general purpose plugin processor would work

ah you re right it looks like i messed up the yaml by overwriting layout instead of calling summary my mistake i appreciate the help 
certainly it s less urgent for me but i d like to turn this into a pull request i still think it represents a hole in jekyll s support for kramdown 
nope i got the same error 
ive just been experimenting on my own machine and git hub github the index page works by just changing the extension to xhtml but the layout templates dont pass their extension onto the pages they generate 
node version  v 01026 v01026
nope same error as in 3084 btw sorry for the duplicate 
i haven t changed anything from the default config yml just left it as it was out of the box jekyll new project 
that does work but of course my setup requires me to declare different paths 
content of haml layout is displays as text no errors 
203
aw man don t say that it should be the latest version of jekyll is installed i believe 220 this was a completely fresh vm created in azure this evening and all components installed as described above i e get latest version the only thing that i didn t install as the latest version was python as i have read that the 3 version of python doesn t play nicely 
parkr wrong repo indeed thanks we re proud to help make ghp speedy 
from what i understand it is a package file with the markdown document all of the assets that are referenced and a metadata json file the biggest benefitin my opinionis the standardised way of grouping assets allowing for easy referencing in a current site i have to do the following site baseurl project name assets asset jpg where as with text bundle textbundle it would become assets asset jpg and the build function would take care of the organisation of the assets 
doh you re right that has never worked my bad 
wow those issues stacked up fast hadn t even noticed it i installed command line tools again and re installed jekyll to no avail will test further and report back 
i would say it s not true to spec which originated with this afaik http www aaronsw com atx 2002atx intro the behaviour is for me surprising and looks untechnical but if it is intended then nevermind 
252
alekst its more of a preference i prefer more the package by feature style over the package by layer having all related post images and any other files inside the post folder is easier to work with 
my use case is too complex to explain doesn t have to be in the core a separate plugin maybe 
as i said this feature should just be for the dev of the site and not for serving users in production the dev can do a full build and deploy chrome dev tools works but you have to duplicate the content html css and it can t use liquid sass there s no easy way to convert a large jekyll project to hugo metalsmith this is an annoying workaround that i ve employed too kleinfreund you won t even want to wait 10 seconds to preview a trivial change my site has about 2000 html pages and takes 12 mins i don t think this is too hard to develop and no matter how slow jekyll becomes in the future single pages won t take time and people can t complain about speed 
yep will do 
thanks for the response yes the config yml is the way to do it however it is intuitive to have frontmatter in leaf pages layouts override what they inherit from  2302 is a ux issue because jekyll has to be restarted to read those values that is a sub optimal workflow which would be fixed by having frontmatter inheritance from layouts 
no it doesn t work disappointed the file is generated dynamically by the gem jekyll tagging https github com pattex jekyll tagging edit i notice this error occurs on 253 too and also on a command prompt 
okay here is the output  the error itself can be avoided by adding if site categories example tag though 
hi yep i ve check the blog post html  it s for chang the date format with plugin 
parkr just gem github pages when remove giflib the problem disappeared is there any possibility that the libraries of giflib conflict with jekyll 
aarhh just realised that this is this issue https github com jekyll jekyll watch issues 22 the affected files are starting with site 
hi i already got the fix put a sticky bit to tmp can solve the issue 
kleinfreund in my config yml also same behavior occurs with redcarpet
i would love too but i have no idea how to explain this 
yes if i delete jekyll metadata the subsequent jekyll build will pick up the config changes however it will also generate a new metadata file which will cause config changes to be ignored again from that point on 
just now i have had tried jekyll 3 beta 8 which should be site jekyll jekyll 20141118jekyll one step html 
jekyll pre 300pre beta 8 beta8 which was installed by default as a dependency for gem install jekyll scholar 
the base url is cooperpellaton github io i ve tried just navigating to 1270014000 only to get the same error img width 1351 alt screenshot 20151004 20 45 49 src https cloud githubusercontent com assets e bca f ad e ad 517801710271282e9bca0f26ad811e594ad a c b e png a5c6b11e0642png 
it handles markdown files and creates liquid style templates afterwards jekyll gets a configuration and renders liquid files to html everything fine but the file copies result in false content it takes the old content which is not in the source anymore right now the environment is the scotch box https box scotch io maybe this is the problem problem is only reproducible on host system ubuntu host system windows 7 does it correct 
i tried to figure that out but every jekyll update breaks my code version 253 300 as well
add links to headers automatically as seen in the nd 2nd example and more flexibility alternatively this could be done with a custom plugin but then it wouldn t work on github pages which s what i want it on 
i do not use plugins unless you already have the jekyll default i have no idea how to run that listen gen debugging 1 command 
i pretty much create images as png by default i m using liquid to build documentation i m a tech writer and figured it would work for images as well as text files if that s not the case no biggie but i wanted to report it in case others tried to do the same and ran into the same error 
hi i thought that ticket was related but i d thought it d throw the question in anyway the company i work for uses htm and they wont change it for seo purposes no matter what i say there is nothing i can do about this unfortunately i would use html all day long
ah didn t know jekyll doctor existed awesome 
ohoh you say in html right i didn t put in html file you mean i should put
easy enough thanks is there a maintained list of the features of liquid core my searches don t turn up anything an concat appears in shopfiy liquid lib liquid standardfilters rb so doesn t appear to be an extension in any way i can percieve 
thanks guys but update theme is not working i reinstall ruby 231 by using rbenv then i jekyll new test and jekyll serve it works it might be something wrong with my ruby 
ashmaroli i mean i changed the markdown file auto generated by jekylly i add some string in it and save the file like this default https cloud githubusercontent com assets d b bf d f 939507318612020d8b27bf07d7f e bf d b af adc 11e69bf66d47b5af2adc png after i save the file jekylly show the error i said before if i restart the jekyll it can work well but i don t want to restart the serve every time i modify 
ok i fix but now i have another error jekyll 330 error uninitialized constant bundler plugin api source
i am not using rouge i am using pygments as highlighter i have found the problem inside the highlight rb file https github com jekyll jekyll blob master lib jekyll tags highlight rb l 108 l108 i think the purpose of this line is to remove additional unwanted tags but when using the table formatter for pygments removing all pre div destroys the format so i would confirm this as a jekyll bug this https github com jekyll jekyll commit bf a b cccb d f b b 0 bf149a0b97187259cccb5323d3396f313b3461b0 is the commit that introduced sub to fix a problem with rouge causing the problem with pygments the trick is needed as otherwise you have additional tags that can cause problems with the layout now the author of the commit says but in this case this caused a problem i think tag removal should be context aware in this case 
i am using the version 331 so do i have to create them but i don t know how this is the first time i use this 
updated above sorry about that i had accidentally put the reproduction steps and output into annotations 
thanks for helping get to the bottom of this to be clear i don t personally have much need for a dir template variable my issue was merely that path s behavior was different from what is described in the docs and i wasn t sure which was correct i will be submitting a pr for the docs instead if that s peachy by you 
yes i just quoted a part of the code i m running in version 341 thanks for answering 
so it was just truncating parts of the php code that s were the error was coming somehow missed this logic at first my bad issue closed 
pathawks i except jekyll liquid can handle correctly no error no warning jekyll liquid complains about legal markdown containing eg  title blog post in markdown 
silly me i always for get to update 
crispgm i ve attached my copy of the repo ty hyde master zip 
i may be misunderstanding your question but i believe you re asking whether the site builds correctly while layouts html 404html is present yes the site builds correctly while layouts html 404html is present as long as the layout is not used by any page the site builds correctly 
baseurl news url https example com the baseurl is being inserted where it should the url is being ignored and replaced with http localhost 4000 as it should then a is being inserted before everything noticed some discussion around githubpages which involved changing baseurl  to baseurl  perhaps some changes in there ended up breaking relative url seems relative url behaviour has changed from convert this to a relative url to take a post path and throw a slash in front of it edit only plugin is this one doesn t seem to touch anything related to paths https github com mryellow jekyll feed json

ahh this is what i was looking for probably a link at the top of the section like this https github com jekyll jekyll pull 6794
hello permalinks pretty was not included in the config yml file that jekyll generated i added it to config yml 
running with trace throws the exact same error i can t know it s related to jekyll 4 for sure with the error thrown however 1 it was working before using jekyll 4 and 2 there seem to be similar issues with established plugins popping up in gitter but again it s hard to tell bc the errors are vague i would be happy to share more info if i could 
no removing any or all slug settings does not solve the issue 
right sorry i did a quick search but did not come across it thanks will pull a fresh copy from the repo

certainly i will put together a pr in the vignette would you prefer an annotation or aside or an inline word of caution about the problematic names 
would this work  https i imgur com e nv png 2e90nv4png 
clauswilke unfortunatly i already reinstalled the old version of ggplot 2 ggplot2 on my machine so the issue is fixed what i can say is try running any script that creates a standard ggplot 2 ggplot2 chart from a file and do so running via task scheduler rscript exe that is basically what i did and still go the same error the issue was only about saving the plot calling ggsave only from rscript exe i am on a windows 10 machine hope that helps  library ggplot 2 ggplot2 set seed 1234 df data frame sex factor rep c f m each 200 weight round c rnorm 200 mean 55 sd 5 rnorm 200 mean 65 sd 5 p ggplot df aes x weight  geom histogram ggsave c my directory mydirectory my file myfile png plot p width 5 height 5 units in

thanks sikachu i patched in the new validation code and all seems to be well again i do wonder though if 30 is ready for primetime this is a pretty fundamental bug is 301 slated soon 
ahh yes that was it i found a file in the initializers folder with these contents  i tried removing the styles line but i get the same error message removing this file entirely however solves the issue i ll get with the person who originally wrote this code and try to find a better solution thanks

should i keep the bad example in readme i think it s counterproductive and keeping only the proper way is better do you agree 
now when looking at the logs with fresh eyes it actually reveals what is happening the first convert resizes the original image to x 1 1x1 image the later converts use that x 1 1x1 image instead of the original to create x 40 40x40 x 80 80x80 and x 120 120x120 images i think it should use the original image in all of the converts 
here is the trace  i am using this version because i have another error with the current version of paperclip i don t remember which one but its related with so paulo s 3 s3 region of aws 
hi by my side the 302 version didn t fix the problem 
i have no clue what is trying to serialize the object i don t have marshall or any other libraries that i explicitly use either way changing the name to job application jobapplication worked 
awesome i switched my gemfile to use master and it worked on my development machine a pretty standard ubuntu box with rvm the only thing i would like to see as an improvement is some sort of visual feedback i only have 30 images in my test database and the task took several minutes which is understandable but it would be nice to see a visual indication that its working away rather than just stuck image 1 done image 2 done image 3 done etc that sort of thing the reason i think this is important is for users with a large number of images we want to run this on our production image library which is gb 12gb of original images natural this will take some time even with high speed servers my guess is 1236 hours without visual feedback it will be tough to know how much longer the task will take or diagnose the problem if it gets stuck

ok i try to explain how it would work i dunno if im up for the task to create a pull request this is how im thinking this should go 
https gist github com anujbiyani 6641455 here it is unedited it s a bit messy sorry i can remove stuff that is completely unrelated to paperclip if you d like i opted to leave as much information in there as possible for now 
i was using ckeditor models widely in the application now i use my own sti models asset asset file assetfile and asset image assetimage and everything seems fine 
thanks jyurek your comment pointed me in the right direction i had a gem using paperclip that had a generator the generator used an old paperclip format for the path in the model updating that fixed the issue thanks again sorry to trouble 
thanks i tried again on a clean rails app and did not have an issue i then removed every gem from my existing rails app to see if the problem would go away eventually i found that someone extended the array class with a to s which was the cause of the infinite loop 
hi tute from what i saw that commit is related only with mime types and not the issue i referred above even so i tried master and the problem persists the memory use is a bit lower but even so it s about mb 30mb in my patch is around mb 5mb 
while uploading csv file it is not a content type validation same file working well with paperclip 421
tute looks like it does 
that s all that was output in the log that i was tailing here s the config and the rest of the trace https gist github com willc de food willc0de4food ad fa b bb a 5 537890180ad642fa047b397543bb45a5 full test code is here https github com willc de food willc0de4food sthree edit when i specify the paperclip beta in my gemfile the error is resolved and the upload succeeds gem paperclip beta 2 500beta2
that would be a dirty hack and does not work in my case i m doing complex stuff with rewrite rules and vhosting but thanks for the idea
is this image path consumed by an api i really do not know if i can do it any other way thank you very much in advance 
nevermind i did some debugging removed a bunch of stuff include carrierwave and it is definitely not carrierwave s fault i jumped to that conclusion too quickly when the problem first manifested 
i created an uploader with nothing in it and mounted it into an activerecord class also empty i then uploaded a file using a standard form and after that i called the url method of the uploader instance i expected it to return the full url to the file e g http example com files png 1png but it only returned the path files png 1png 
carrierwave 045 and json pure 143 as gems could be the json pure perhaps 
i figured out what was going on first you must return the image passed into manipulate i don t believe that was documented but it makes complete sense after writing some of my own imagemagick code 
happy to do it as a pull request but for sanity would something like this work url escape url unescape url the unescaping i think would unescape an already escaped string but again i think would leave an unescaped string along p
i ve tried but still have some issues with some specs 
dangit the trick was to change not a rails issue at all thanks though 
that s it calling url returns path to the old image which is not deleted when it should point to the newly generated image and it is created so recreate versions is useless this way 
sorry about the late reply i gave a look at this issue yesterday again and it was working i can t reproduce the bug anymore i haven t changed something in the uploaders setup nor mongoid just let a week pass while working on other parts of my app i can t reproduce the bug anymore and don t have any failing test or more logs sorry thanks for the great work

copy paste the same code and change the filename i know it is awful but i could not just say and then redefine filename versions weren t found i asked at stackoverflow but did not get an answer so i started experimenting and at first the original issue of the thread seemed like a possible way 
just did it again and this is the error i get which is very similar to the one above but a bit different 
well i tried sinatra base public folder and it also returns nil 
okay i ll give it a try let s say we have two versions small and thumb  and our cache directory is at project home public uploads tmp now we upload file jpg if move to cache is set to false the following will happen 1 file jpg get uploaded to server at some var tmp localtion 2 file jpg is copied to project home public uploads tmp file jpg 3 file jpg is copied to project home public uploads tmp small file jpg 4 file jpg is copied to project home public uploads tmp thumb file jpg 5 small file jpg is resized to 200 limits 6 thumb file jpg is resized to 50 limits 7 all files get copied to store now consider the case where move to cache is set to true replace copied with moved in the step above notice that at step 3 project home public uploads tmp file jpg will no longer exist because it was moved to small file jpg and thus step 4 will fail because it looks for file jpg hope that helps you can run the test and see for yourself i think the fix should be pretty straight forward when the versions are initialized set move to cache to false 
sorry i made a mistake in the initial question i ve updated the code above to be more clear 
hey guys thanks so much for taking a look your documentation does state any file object can be passes to store but i m mistakenly passing a string so my inexperience of rails is to blame here and in fact your documentation is quite clear having said that in the loosely typed world of ruby i feel carrierwave shouldn t fail silently especially if its a type error 
eavgerinos using fog storage they behave as expected but using file storage their behaviour is flipped in an attempt to explain it better here s the hack i m relying on at the moment  does this help 
perhaps randomizing with a certain result set say books published within the last 20 years or something also we still don t handle the end of a carousel very well so i hesitate to limit it but how about a slightly larger limit like 20 or 30 you re saying we can hide checked out stuff if you add the pagination limit then 
yes the field for title variants is useful information for the reasons stated these are edition specific not at the work level populating the field is not required 
was trying to replicate 613 and see if the error still persists on editing profile of a newly created user 
hornc i think i meant that the separation s on the home page as what you re talking about is the page one gets directed to when clicked on if those stats could be separated on the home page that would be cool i mean it s a matter of preference in the end though 
guyjeangilles no i mean show all editions on a work s page all the works on an author list page too 
paulbaumgart i tried again from inside starter and got the same error 
hi further to my reply on git hub github i can however attach an image to an email  note that the margin to the right of update is smaller than the other margins on the segments i have another segmented control in the app that shows the same problem regards nigel on 7 apr 2011 at 1806 aljungberg wrote

error there too i used the openbabel package found on the standard ubuntu repository if that helps

ah it seems 277 was released on the th 15th i ll pull it down give it a try and post results thanks 
ok i have a reproducible test case now which causes a seg fault not just a backtrace the problem is that i have a large k 200k text file which has the messages which cause the crash that would be difficult to put in a gist i will email it to you the crash does not happen on osx with libxml 276 but does happen on ubuntu hardy with 273 with 141 and 142
hmm okay i ll check my code data set and see if i can replicate the issue with better documentation 
i submitted pull request 623 how do you submit a pull request for an existing git hub github issue 
thanks tenderlove i have sent it to the moderators on the google group yes i thought that was the issue but i got the same result after installing the apparent dependancies  libxml 2 libxml2 libxml dev libxml2dev libxslt libxslt dev
voila 
hmm it doesn t seem to matter what xml document i use here is a test file i created that triggers the crash when i try to parse xml version 10 encoding utf 8 root test name id t name 1t1name loc http example com loc test root i can parse this document fine using the same version of nokogiri in ruby 187
i was afraid that would be the case i was hoping that i would get lucky and the problem would be obvious from the crash log the code is in the attached issue it really is this simple  the xml file is the sticking point i may not be able to release it i shall have to talk to various people and see if i can convince them would it be an option to send it privately to nokogiri maintainers rather than putting it up for public view in a gist etc that might help my case 
hopefully by today the gem is building from native extensions so there is no problem with dependencies but something tells me that the problem lies in the dependencies dependencies here are about libxml 2 libxml2 libxslt 11 libxslt11 and other things gcry check version is related to libgcrypt library but i already have it installed 
i ve installed libxxml 2 libxxml2 version 278 via brew install libxml 2 libxml2 and i ve tried to re install nokogiri pointing out the new libxml 2 libxml2 via but when i ask nokogiri v i still see that it is using 273 i also tried using bundle config and re running bundle install as documented in the wiki page about libxml 2 libxml2 being a jerk what am i doing wrong thanks in advance for the assistance edit ok completely removing nokogiri and using the install steps on nokogiri org worked 278 does fix the issue closing this thanks 
thanks for reply i need to duplicate google adwords xml report exactly they use single quotes mike on sat feb 4 2012 at 509 pm aaron patterson reply reply github com wrote 
yes i do i m using this same code to successfully fetch the encoding from hundreds of documents only this page fails 
if the initial string is not html text should then not return html as you can see in the example it actually gives you p text p but that p node never existed in the first place so some kind of conversion from text to markup is being done 
unless you re using rvm or rbenv you ll always need a sudo gem install otherwise just try blowing stuff away uninstalling so you start with as much of a clean slate as you can 
actualy it is not caused by a 0a it s caused by encoding invalid byte sequence invalidbytesequence then the rest text is not parsed x c 1 xc1 followed by on gbk encoding invalid byte sequence error invalidbytesequenceerror

i m working in brackets i m assuming the code is the same since the version number is the same i installed it fresh is there a different fix for brackets 
ok sounds good looked at the package and it is just the lib package json no cmdline interface script so it would be just best to do the package from scratch and negotiate with clark to replace it as it holds this project name currently we can probably start with another node package which works but does not seem to be maintained https github com rickeyski node beautifier issues
evocateur you re entitled to your opinion and i respect that personally i ve always disliked comma first style but throughout years i ve come to appreciate the ease of moving taking out commenting deleting etc and as bitwiseman says diffing so i m willing to leave this as an option and let the user do whatever he prefers sometimes its not in his hands and he has to go by already set standards yeah fugly but reality bitwiseman at any level of indent 2 or 4 i guess this is how it should look  i think this is also consistent with how some of sql editors where comma first is more prevalent do it and while i m not advocating promoting bad layouts i guess there is always a fine line between being idiomatic and dogmatic think crockford here comma first may not be prevalent because many of the formatters don t support it whatever may be their reason you re more familiar with the state of affairs code wise so i perfectly agree your roi argument nevertheless i thought of asking so that we can get these things out in the open have a quorum to discuss things and if there is demand from community maybe you guys can rethink about it p s i spent a couple of hours trying to see if i can quickly spin off something and wasn t very successful maybe i ll give it a shot some other time 
yeah sure expected and input 
to indent with tabs instead of spaces well actually i did not think about replacing teh character indent char t indent size 1 work too 
for instance animated webkit animation duration s 5s animation duration s 5s webkit animation fill mode both animation fill mode both transform translate z translatez 0 its missing all the closing semicolons when beautified
yes in a style tag i use the html css js prettify plugin with sublime text 3
input  the difference between expected and actual is space in for and the space in if

i would like to thank you very much for this software it has a great impact on my life seriously indeed when i reversed the order of my entries it worked i use this ordering because i then don t need to scroll down everytime and i have the most recent entries on top i guess i can write a small script that reverses ordering and feed the output to budget i will wait until the new version is in repositories though closing this issue since my version is not supported anymore thanks

sure done http bugs ledger cli org show bug cgi id 985
you re right issue 546 fixes it i confirmed by building from the next branch and running that one you re also right the homebrew formula uses the current release which i think is on purpose i m not involved enough with homebrew development to know how they d like to have the next alpha branch in their formula or with ledger development to know whether or not your bug fix should be applied to the current stable 
for the moment i m adding a final suite to verify the correct number of tests run describe end function  it should have correct number of describe blocks function  expect jasmine current env currentenv next suite id nextsuiteid to equal toequal test total suites totalsuites  it should have correct number of it blocks function  expect jasmine current env currentenv next spec id nextspecid to equal toequal test total specs totalspecs  
thank you that does work but html reporter htmlreporter piles all of the results from every call to it at the bottom of the report instead of within the test it was called from 
this is wrong and entirely an artifact of some bizarre interactions in surrounding code i sincerely apologize for taking your time 
yes i believe you are right sheelc once you put some significant attributes in the backbone model the code which checks for object equality loops through all those attributes i guess the easiest way to reproduce the problem is create a large number of attributes on the backbone model and try again if i have a chance i will try to put together a test case i m fairly certain you will see this with anything that has lot of attributes on it which really shouldn t effect the equality check 
thank you for the timely response i did not know about custom equality testers i think with those i can re create the pattern i need also in the example the tester is added in before each beforeeach would it suffice to add it only once at startup 
well for example i ve thought throu what test will be needed but haven t implemented yet but after some time one can forget about what is done and what is not and when running test one might see that everything is okay without knowing that there is no actual test done maybe at least tests could add some prefix to test description at runtime saying that everything is okay as they do now but also saying something like
evidently not unfortunately 
not able to reproduce now will reopen the issue if see that happening again sorry about that 
makes sense thank you for taking the time to find out 
my apologies i ve tested this and confirmed that two tests with the same name do run i was running my tests using karma with the karma mocha reporter plugin it looks like the reporter was just not listing both of the tests interestingly this happened in another reporter karma spec reporter too so either it s a karma bug or a common design error 
to me it looks like jasmine is doing some simple parsing on the errors and it s a bug in this parsing in the first example i would expect to see something like this  note that this is exactly what jasmine outputs now just in different order and in the second example i would expect to see an error message like expected spy unknown to have been called with b any es promise es6promise promise promise constructors are functions and it doesn t make sense to put the whole function in the error report name would be enough this affects only jasmine any i believe 
thanks for the update i see why it s happening now if you re interested when i attempt to log in with my github credentials it produces the following error authentication failed insufficient data from authentication provider name not provided or empty
the patch also adds a username parameter to e g eapleap stage 4 stage4 what i would like to have would be a way to log challenge response username as username netntlm challenge response to make it easy to run it through john the ripper 
umm still having problems does not seem to be exactly the same in case it helps i m sending a saml assertion ukerna vendor specific attribute the contents you see in 6 do not look like what i sent some errors in the string such as paml instead of saml i guess memory is getting corrupted

the is unicode parameter seems redundant you have check if the value is unicode so why you need is unicode again why not fully deprecate it my test case will crash the program if i am unware of is unicode

re the source download link when you select the git repository link from http www web py web2py com init default download select the clone or download button then click download zip this zip should have all the source files recursively i was able to work around the issue by getting the source code from the link on the main screen or by using git manually with the recursive command option i didn t notice the main screen link at first because i am planning to develop so i went to the developer s buttons first on fri jul 15 2016 at 1216 pm cssio botaro notifications github com wrote

hi i updated neo j neo4j to 308 we use enterprise edition 
mea culpa it seems that app restart helped 
ooops my fault  do you think we could use a similar approach to solve the load fixtures question issue 611
two questions in fact i in the neo j neo4j core we do index labels like below does this apply to rails usage as well or rails version does some kind of an auto index to labels 
this is a new piece code but getting the same error with e d dedc a c e a b ac f 3e386d50dedc8a5704c1247e7a77b0ac0242757f from sep 6
wow thanks fella i don t remember where i see greater or equal than but i found it somewhere yesterday my bad i suppose i have no idea yeah maybe it was valid on rails 3 keepin it rocking with neo j neo4j rb peace 
thanks for the quick feedback i assumed that ar 417 worked in rails and i was having problems because i m using sinatra somehow when i add the neo j neo4j gem my app loses track of the environment variable here s my gemfile lock 
yes it can wait i was planning to work on a feature i m building using active job sometime early next week 
yes i included the concern after the neo j neo4j active node activenode but anyway thanks to subvertallchris you solution worked perfectly y 
i would suggest to follow ruby s principle of least surprise or at least to document the fact that something does not work as one may expect as it happens in this issue 
i spoke with someone about it on gitter but i can t recall with who at this point if this was a neo j neo4j quirk however i would like to see neo j neo4j rb handle it more gracefully than unexpected behavior from the user s perspective 
this is just a regular find params id i am explicitly using transactions elsewhere but i ensure that these are closed
it makes perfect sense thanks for taking the time to explain i also see your conundrum in order to print a warning you would effectively have to respond to the idea that the gem is being run in a rails project which creates an explicit coupling to rails i suppose you could print such a warning whenever a command is forwarded to neo j neo4j rake tasks but i suppose the most reasonable way to deal with this would be to just put a line somewhere in the docs 
sure let me have a go

thanks for the fast response who is supposed to close this bug 
i found the bug last night it s in active record i can fix it there but rails 3 rails3 has totally refactored how this works so i m not sure if it s worth submiting it does it make sense to try to retro fix ts to work reliably with 235
ah apologies i did a quick search but i guess it doesn t show closed issues in default search should we continue the discussion over there i m in a rails 301 app using thinking sphinx thinkingsphinx 200 is this right i had been using rc 2 200rc2 which had the issue but i upgraded to 200 when i went to gem cutter gemcutter and noticed 200 was available hoping that it would fix the issue i only have one indexed model in this application actually so once i patched both to json and as json the error went away completely which doesn t make any sense because your method missing is designed correctly to handle both correctly and i m just essentially recreating that explicitly i m also not sure if just requiring yajl is sufficient to make rails use it over active support activesupport s 
i am using globalize 3 globalize3 https github com svenfuchs globalize 3 globalize3 i took a quick look through their source and i didn t see update index being defined and i am not redefining update index 
ah right you are pat while the problem only became manifest in 205 it looks like it could more rightly be attributed to the awesome print awesomeprint gem that we are using in rails console specifically it s being caused by the irb integration part of the awesome print install https github com michaeldv awesome print taking that out of irbrc fixes it something about the ap context last value on the result of a sphinx search doesn t work quite right 
thnks pat and i am sorry that i wasted your time this is the old logic that i used before sphinx and has nothing to do with the sphinx there is search method that s conflicting with it sorry 
if i just do school query foo it would return results that can be paginated etc 
thank you for the quick reply problem is solved now actually i was not change the address in the sphinx yml now in cofing development sphinx conf and config sphinx conf are same address

that s a good point about not needing to restart on every deploy i hadn t though of that i think i put it in originally so i wouldn t have to remember to restart as when i did in fact change the index definitions or configuration i may well take it out as far as i can tell the previous searchd process doesn t get killed properly here s a snippet from the log  i m going to do a quick deploy now to verify this

hi pat thanks for the tip on min infix len i ve also enabled the expand keywords option as described here http sphinxsearch com docs current html conf expand keywords it wouldn t fix my issue but seems nice to have my config thinking sphinx yml file now looks like this  neither wildcard search nor substring search are working even though the sql surrounds each space separated search string with characters i ve also tried activating enable star and min infix len without expand keywords i m still able to match individual complete words or consecutive and non consecutive sets of complete words but i can t match partial words with or without wildcards any other tips you have would be greatly appreciated thanks 
yes i was just going to look at this get the stack trace and also see if i could write a failing spec for it as well i ll comment with more soon 
in this example i have project has many tasks and a lot of unassigned tasks i d like to enter id s of tasks that may be found for example with autocomplete and submit to application currently it s submitting as string is there any way to submit as array 
i m running justinfrench formtastic 024
using version 235
i use rails 235 and formtastic 097 best regards boris
running tests on latest are passing i submitted a pull request 
sorry forgot to mention rails beta 4 300beta4 formtastic beta 100beta
thanks so much for the feedback justin my app still works fine if i install activesupport 302 manually before formtastic so will do that for now just one more reason to move to bundler asap my personal feeling as someone who has contributed nothing more than a small bugfix to formtastic is that since it s a rails specific library removing the activesupport dependency probably isn t such a bad solution for now edit just saw that the readme does state that bundler should be used 
i m not sure what you mean running rake should yield a failing spec 
i did a fresh install of formtastic using bundler my gemfile entry reads gem formtastic  120 bundler cannot find the repository for v 200 v200 when using the gemfile entry gem formtastic  200
okay i ll keep my quick and dirty fix on my working copy thanx to both of you for your prompt answers 
yes i have restarted server etc the problem is still there i m using rails 303 and formtastic 124
i made the spec but i didn t send a push request because it passes https github com taavo formtastic commit ab b f b cedce a bccb f d e 02 8ab6b3f26b8cedce774a4470bccb127f055d4e02 my live code unfortunately continues to fail for the record i get the same behavior when the code is simplified to the following and it behaves the same whether user status is a string or a boolean  i just created a fresh out of the box 309 project for testing and got the same behavior 3010 and 310 works correctly seems like it could be easier to update to 3010 than troubleshoot this 
at the moment i was just looking at an ugly  f input born at as string label date of birth input html  value f object born at strftime d m y  wrapper html  class date  i m all up for other options of course and versions of formtastic i m currently on 124 i thought about creating another input type to do what i m after but i found the code a little over whelming oops 
has and belongs to many
nice it works small correction post copy has to be post copy 
i tried locally and it works as expected i think the same must be fixed for time picker and datetime picker if you need more help with writing failing specs or something i will be glad just let me until next week now i m in a work storm 
in this case a list of string input and a add more button to add an empty input to add more tags i m not looking to add relation datas or datas that already exists on db 
yes but for example if i have a rectangle and i want to scale it using a slide control so when it comes for the y argument to be equal to 0 i expect that the rectangle s width size will be 0 too instead of that i get the original width size that s the case for the x argument it works as expected thank you again 
i try to explain better i not speak english very well in my application is use raphael library and raphalel freetransform whit raphael i visualize the image and text for example when i draw an image with paper image src x y width height where src is a fisycal path in my file system in explorer the image is visualized well in chrome i see all white and when i click in the space where the image should be inserted i see only the raphael free transform freetransform for text instead if i use paper text and associate to it attributes font weight and font style in explorer work only font family and font size but any value for font weight or font style not work in chrome instead work still in explorer with raphael free transform freetransform i can move the object any object text image with chrome raphael free transform freetransform does nothing thanks

i went to the website and wondered hey this looks like sinatra so my initial question was whether it was a coincident which it apparently wasn t i then wondered how much it differs and was hoping to find some statement on the site somewhere also give blake some credit by mentioning sinatra it won t cost you devs since ppl would use it in the first place due to perl i mean the basic api of mojolicious lite is an exact copy of the sinatra api plus all the websocket api you could point that out as an advantage over sinatra btw but if you don t feel like it ok 
all things being equal probably not but every param appears to have been added to compensate for param no longer returning a list providing alternatives for everything but default helpers defaulthelpers param makes could make a big breaking change more difficult to deal with when upgrading 
no idea but it s clear current behaviour break things at least for very usual values in href attribute and conflicts with at least one spec am i should dig whatwg spec too for some reason 
d oh you are right there was a call into self app in startup indeed looks like that was no problem before so error on our side thanks for the hint 
i see the heart of the functionality as introducing the use of role tiny apply roles to package caller role packages i cannot see anything in role tiny that requires the target package to be a class nor that the functions being introduced be methods so strictly as far as i can tell it doesn t matter while i am naturally not asking for pre approval before i ve written code at this point i m not really prepared to write any code unless i see some degree of buy in 
the benefit comes in when user clocks and server clocks don t match up if you set a session for an hour and the clocks differ by an hour or more not timezone but just wrong the session will be broken for users max age wouldn t fix this for all users but it could at least fix it for users using any modern browsers all modern browsers except for microsoft edge i believe support this https developer mozilla org en us docs web http headers set cookie browser compatibility so it should affect a lot of users and if you include expires and max age browsers that support max age will use that instead and browsers that don t will just ignore and use expires so this would have no real negative impact besides slightly smaller session data and a larger positive one and would only add a small amount of code 
yeah if the convention is to use and not then i agree that it doesn t make sense i tried to find if there was a standard consistent way via googling but i didn t find a consensus i have two use cases i ve done this for now one was using in urls for a site where that was already the delimiter and i wanted to keep the ur ls urls the same the other was to create a valid subroutine name from a string for a mojolicious helper which to be fair isn t really slugify ing since it s not meant for a url 
ha you re right that s my mistake it looks like those would be the same i ll go ahead and close thanks 
i use the following to benchmark time hi res hires time vs core time and although t hr time is 3 times slower it still runs at e s 14e6s ns 70ns per call vs ns 25ns on my computer 
thanks for the heads up tried again with mojolicious 812 results unchanged 
i created a sample app with a test to demonstrate this problem http nragaz com rest example zip the gemfile is simple  again setting up the initializer manually in config environments test rb works 
i looked further into this issue and it has nothing to do with factory girl ruby 19 chokes on non ascii characters by definition i overcome this by putting  encoding utf 8 as the first line of every file that had non ascii characters 
hi joshua that actually was a good tip the error has nothing to do with factory girl and i should have taken the advice to heart to look if i can instantiate the object via console before filing an issue it actually has been a misconfiguration in the mongoid mappings sorry for bothering cheers stefan
it works fine when i m using basic model interaction but we d like to use factory girl factorygirl and i checked test log and there is no inserts made into the table 
thanks i just used bundle update what should i use instead of factory i am so confused by docs for fg 4 fg4 and old ones 
thanks 
thank you for your response its working now that was probably the problem i was fiddling around with rails helper and spec helper my apologies 
joshuaclayton only one factory file in the project this is the full output in the terminal is that the backtrace sorry noob here 
hi i compiled ruby from source into programs ruby p 194 193p194 but now that you mention that i think that was the problem the array rb file contained my modifications i used in ruby 187 and now that i am on 193 some things don t need to be used as is there anymore i even defined a to hash method there which was the culprit  i changed that and now prawn suddenly works fine the pdf example was also generated sorry for the bother  i will close this issue now 
yeah i did maybe wait with the merge till the errors are fixed i got a long train ride saturday i can take a look at them during the trip if you want 
bradediger i m working on a crude bisect to narrow down the commit but i m having to restart rails between each checkout i ll get back to you both images use pdf image but the logo is a path where as the the map is using open with a url which afaik should be returning an io object 
if its a documentation bug not a big deal as long as documentation gets updated i worked around it by creating a separate font family to handle these weird cases i ll craft a more specific failing example test script as soon as i get a chance thanks

as a variant yes this code is suitable but i still hope to find solution which uses no external tools only default x environment 
here s my config https bitbucket org jagguli qtile config src bd efc at 2bd949efc017at master no idea why thats being set i ve worked around it by creating set group hooks might be a change in conkeror 
the current one is exec qtile since i m new to this project i d like to know the difference between qtile and qtile session i m going to package it into fedora i need to understand something won t confuse people thanks 
on my system two of the so filenames are slightly different so i m using libpango and libpangocairo should have been installed through apt i used dpkg l libpango amd 64 100amd64 and dpkg l libpangocairo amd 64 100amd64 to locate these files i m not sure if this counts as a bug or if there is a more system independent way to write this but it s a step beyond the documented installation instructions i had to take 
frostidaho from what i understand they seem to be just fine internal setup 
qtile python git python3git ec 036211 26455ec036211 i got this behavior using xterm 
hi i upgraded from 013 to 0142 i m deliberately making a mistake in my own config py file and then the default keybind does not work 
the two methods need other two parameters  move floating dx dy curx cury  resize floating dw dh curx cury on lazy window move floating x y is sent only two parameters on libqtile window there are the functions on the lines 13271333 i don t know why need to pass 4 parameters to the function because it uses only two so when i tryed keybinding qtile cmd or via qshell just not worked two parameters missing 
i have it installed but i do not know how to make an error file i ran it in a command window the configuration file in my home i do not have it and i tried it with the one that comes by default anyway it gives me configuration error in the bar below maybe it s a problem of compiling python in debian
only notices that some optional libs are missing wifi etc 
sorry i don t use qtile anymore  original message on friday march 13 2020 257 pm tycho andersen notifications github com wrote 
it generates config error i think i m setting up the widget but still my config breaks tho running python m py compile config qtile config py it doesn t says that a made any mistake in my config but still my config breaks here https gist github com godnyx f b af b de ffd dae 56752 f943b93af25b5de9ffd59159dae56752 is my config 
i ended up just connecting over localhost 25 instead of using the send process probably not worth investigating if it s working on your end 
i m newbie in ruby but if it helps i have added some tests https github com aleshgo mail commit c dc a cea b b b b d ab c 956 7c45dc48a84cea836b886b005b5b416d3ab4c956
for the gmail api to send an email you http post to the api an rfc 2822 rfc2822 format email encoded in base 64 base64 api reference https developers google com gmail api v reference v1reference users messages send the api supports the bcc field however when i m generating the rfc 2822 rfc2822 format email via this gem the bcc field is not included i understand the reason why the bcc field is being stripped out in the normal case but in my arguably abnormal case the stripping of the field makes it impossible for me to bcc messages using this gem to generate the rfc 2822 rfc2822 format 
sure i haven t encountered this in production but i was working on a refactor of a notification system that would have been able to do some fancy tricks by passing mail message s around and then calling deliver in a centralized location but given the common usage pattern in rails of invoking deliver directly on the mailer it would have created this risk so abbreviated 
hi ahorek thank you for your response some software is known to modify convert messages in a subtle way e g by converting the transfer encoding to bit 7bit quoted printable or base 64 base64 or removing trailing spaces it doesn t matter for many users because the meaning of the message is preserved the message will be delivered and will be readable that said when you re going to sign your message with open pgp and probably some other tools as well you got another problem such alterations typically invalidate the signature for this reason both rfc 1847 security multiparts and rfc 3156 mime security with open pgp openpgp make restrictions on transfer encoding they require that the signed message part is encoded either as quoted printable or base 64 base64 and has no trailing spaces and this is the only reason why i want to force the transfer encoding of my choice the problem is explained in detail in rfc 3156 section 3 content transfer encoding restrictions and somewhat in rfc 1847 section 21 definition of multipart signed  https tools ietf org html rfc 1847 rfc1847 https tools ietf org html rfc 3156 rfc3156
ok will do in the coming week thanks jeremy 
hi jeremy thanks for the quick response i just tried both 271 and edge 280edge and the problem is still reproducible on both if my reading of https github com mikel mail pull 1062 is correct it only added support for the utf 7 binary encoding and not the utf 7 quoted printable encoding 
hehe that s it this is from an admin page everything in there is from django which is excluded from the trace
thanks this has done the trick i guess there were stale pyc files hanging around 
thank you for the reponse no errors that i could see in the console upon further re testing today the problem appears to have gone away the only thing i ve done is removed and re added the app in my settings file haven t rebooted or done anything to my browser chrome appears to be the same version still and i haven t upgraded anything 
no errors and i just tested with master branch and still same issue 
perhaps a note in the documentation regarding using the toolbar with projects using java script javascript libraries that define their own global require function would be a good idea the warning could describe the above solution i ll submit a pull request if i get a chance to work on this 
no this is not a error just warnning but it cause http 500 the last few lines like 
note that debug toolbar middleware recommends going first but it works better if it s after whitenoise which should be first ala  serving media files isn t slow what was slow was all the profiling and stuff being run on all the static content requests note from whitenoise project i run my development using gunicorn and most of the static requests tend to be 304 responses machine was getting bogged down trying to profile requests that weren t needed it s actually usable now not running ddt on prod

that s what s recommended in the documentation http django debug toolbar readthedocs org en latest installation html quick setup adding gzip to that and setting debug to false will cause the exception 
which code did you use 
matthiask yes that fix works thanks for suggesting it 
i am using chrome version 7303683103 build officiel 64 bits this is the latest version i have the same problem on safari on ubuntu 1804 with chrome firefox the problem is the same
all page loads that should show the toolbar result in 400 anytime show toolbar returns true a 400 status is returned is there anything i can to do provide more info am happy to help debug this from my end i ve tried reordering the placement of debug toolbar middleware debug toolbar middleware debugtoolbarmiddleware in the middleware array as well no luck 
i am on ubuntu 8
doh i totally forgot to check my version and inform you what my environment was i m running v 1435 v1435 on ubuntu 1204 bit 64bit i assumed that i was running a late version since i installed it several weeks ago turns out that the version available by apt get is rather out of date your commits do fix the problem so this is resolved 
thanks but it does not help the git code starts always with german language how my operation system 
alt ctrl 0 seems like a good suggestion though it s probably a good idea to check with someone who uses the bindings regularly and on other os s 
sorry it was merely a suggestion i am no artist i use git cola every day on ubuntu though and love it the icon just seems a little outdated 
davvid no i am proposing integrating the whole git deps web ui 
the revert fixed it the success list comes from calling table on the query table for some reason we decided to make table return a string instead of being void i don t think fitnesse does anything with the result so changing table to not return anything also fixes the problem however i m guessing a similar problem will occur if the query method returns list with an element that has in it see https github com gshakhn fitnesse commit da bf bc d b e f ecacfb f e 23835 da9bf793bc1d4b01551e6f94ecacfb14f3e23835 for a test case 
not sure why you say hundreds of rows is fishy we switched to slim few months ago but this issue is common in both this is a very common use case all of our tests had to be refactored to smaller tests had been trying to resolve this since a year now yahoo groups never responded 
just a lot of stuff such as json serialized documents and ensuring that certain elements are in there via regexs 
we have a lot of templates some are generic global to the entire suite and some are scoped to specific suites there are about 15 generic templates so far and can be another 1520 specific to another suite our goal is to have a template per fixture as documentation to qa of our available fixtures 
thanks for your help and sorry for the delayed response on this it looks like the issue was just in the weird version not sure how that happened a more recent one fixed the problem if it s still of any interest the memory usage would grow to a normal size at the start of the test and then spike right at the end after the test was finished memory usage would not decrease running the test multiple times did not cause the memory to spike as dramatically at the end but did increase memory usage over time again the newer version of fit nesse fitnesse fixed the issue so it s probably not an issue any more 
this happens in every single search i run title or content based whenever the search is complete that seems to be the pattern this does not occur when doing a properties based search which i thought was kind of peculiar 
our problem is everybody can create new pages on the root level for example this fitnesse instance works with fitnesse ldap authenticator fitnesserio https cloud githubusercontent com assets b a 93514305200214860629b8754a e jpg 11e49402191623091136jpg i don t have access on front page frontpage but i could create this page http fitnesserio ep petrobras com br hello world 8080helloworld fitnesseriohelloworld https cloud githubusercontent com assets abed e 935143052002521abed88e b 754b e ad 11e484ad b da de bcf b5da61de5bcf jpg we need to know how to protect non authorized user to create new pages on this environment thank you regards lvia
i managed to get it working by changing the method name to public boolean check if sorted checkifsorted list string values so this is definitely looks like a method naming issue i would like to know the rules and why is sorted issorted cannot be found by slim system 
yes 
to ensure highly available sut and abstract the web server from running the test it s not a big issue but is nice to have i m can think of some workaround to do it but i want to know first if fitnesse slim support it out of the box 
i have defined vm arguments in the command pattern on the root page of fitnesse what i want to do is i want to override those arguments before running every test page on the front page of fitnesse tcnh
unfortunately not but i came to a similar conclusion however it s pretty much unclear which page is wrongly formatted 
all hundreds of other cases passed except this one 
ok i will do it tomorrow now in belarus we go to sleep 
that works a treat matt ta

my apologies this is irrelevant for the ruby cucumber 
this issue happens when launching displaying ssh command which generates some utf 8 utf8 output the ssh command is launched via open 3 open3 ruby library operating system fedora 18 fedora18 afaik something similar happened when inside the step there was an attempt to get web page with curl http which had used utf 8 utf8 formatting when i get more information i will put it here 
hi sorry for the delay in response i have been away from work i found the problem i had previously setup rspec autorun as a dependency in part to clean up the stacktrace on an error see https gist github com brass kazoo 8588975 this is largely unnecessary now and have removed it i suppose that autorun s exit hook code is what is actually causing the error message and not cucumber team city teamcity is now running and reporting on the tests properly 
this is a problem with the released gem i have not tried testing with master it is the same issue reported at https groups google com forum msg cukes ysb x qd dscg ysbx8qddscg fpndv ei p zu yj fpndveipzuyj basically when the proc is called the first time the test runs just fine each subsequent run the steps all get printed to console as if the test is executing but the actual step definitions are not exercised i have verified this through debug logging as well as some cursory work with the debugger 
in build step step hash step hash multiline arg was nil in v 13 v13
no i don t have the syntax gem
thanks for the quick reply the test case you brought up is structurally the same however there are two differences  in the test case i linked the insert is done using a prepared statement in the test case i linked autocommit is turned off i think both differences are valid uses of odbc if you follow the link you find two code examples one with sqla the other with plain pyodbc i am reposting the example with plain pyodbc here

i have tried using both python 345 and python 35 on open suse opensuse 421 latest version of unix odbc unixodbc 234 currently i have microsoft s official linux drivers installed for sql server 11 13 and 17 trying to run this program against any of them results in a segmentation fault when running the program locally on my windows machine using sql server native client 110 and either python 34 or 35 it does not result in a segmentation fault 
unfortunately not the code is closed source and the query is closely coupled with the database design not something that could be easily reproduced 
upgrading unix odbc unixodbc to 237 indeed fixed the issue you re awesome 
thanks for the very quick response a setting of this sort would be great for me as i only ever need 1 the last result set in the meantime i have worked around the issue by just re connecting with a modified version of the the injected conn string to have the database that i need just posted issue here in case others come across this 
this is from an install of py py 36 pypy36 downloaded in the last 23 days right off the py py pypy site pyodbc should work with py py pypy correct thanks m
so i just realized that i was ignoring disregarding warning messages in ssms which i believe results in cursor not being a query and pyodbc throwing programming error programmingerror no results previous sql was not a query the warning warning null value is eliminated by an aggregate or other set operation set ansi warnings off solved the issue therefore it s not a bug thank you both

thanks for your quick answer here is a complete app that illustrate the problem http github com cyrille speciality just run a console and run speciality create title toto several times and you see the error no method error errornomethoderror undefined method friendly id config for nil nil class nilclass bty i ve just discovred that if you don t have cached slug it s working maybe a hint of the issue 
i dug into the code of both versions and it seems that the misunderstanding is from my side if i remember correctly then the older version first queried all appropriate record based on the slug and then filtered the collection based on the scope this allowed to evaluate the instance methods of those records returned by the initial query in the new code it does things differently it queries the records based on the slug and scope right away which is clearly more efficient so if i understood it correctly then its impossible to do what i described before it also does not make much sense and accidentally worked before 
there are multiple types of users the foreign key on the productions table is user id the abstract user abstractuser class uses set table name to make the database table just users 
hmmm where do i see what version is supported with 23 on the homepage i e readme md it says friendly id friendlyid is compatible with active record x 23x and 30 and friendly id friendlyid will continue to support x 23x until rails 31 is released i don t think rails 31 is out is it 
the friendly id is generated automatically from say a page title the page s title is controlled via cms by a client they named their page say something something related somethingrelated i don t have control over what they do should i tell them not to use slashes i mean it just makes an unreadable url  somethingsomethingrelated  why can t i have it make something somethingrelated 
hey norman i have not solved it but i made a hack to fix it going directly into mysql code the bug still exist but i can report it again when i get back to the issue right now i can t sorry christoffer 20111011 norman clarke reply reply github com 
yes saved the post with friendly id the code that is generating this query is the following 
confirmed rc 1 rc1 here is the output  and get the same issue 
parndt well sure one second but comment about find primary would be nice anyway 
happy new year compay so it turns out that as usual i was wrong ftr the versions i m using are rails 416 and friendly id 504 my mistake was trying to regenerate the slug for a case without having populated the friendly id slugs table for every existing record before so now with an empty friendly id slugs table i ran this in the console  that populated the history table with the current slugs after that regenerating a slug worked fine and took my nd 2nd ption from the slug candidates before it wasn t able to find the existing conflicting slug because it didn t exist in the history table yet although it existed in the cases table here s for a great 2015 cheers ps i decided to keep my dependency with 504 because it s the latest stable should i really upgrade to beta 1 510beta1 even being a beta is 504 that buggy

yeah it works with your updated repo thank you for taking time to fix this minor issue would you briefly explain for someone who knows little about emacs how you solve the issue besides you suggested in https github com purcell exec path from shell setting up your shell startup files correctly that config files should therefore set the environment variables to their exact desired final values but that can be out of some users control in my bash profile for example there is export path users zhfu anaconda bin anaconda2bin path which is automated added by anaconda 2 anaconda2 installer apparently

hey folks i was actually not thinking of replacing the current behavior but augmenting it either with a if else or body body unless body is a array perhaps it was just me that ran into this issue and i ll remember going forward but it does seem like a quirk ie a usability issue with the api and one that will bite anyone following tutorials listed on the rack tutorial wiki https github com rack rack wiki tutorials and with ruby x 19x specifically these http m onkey org ruby on rack hello 1hello rack tutorial http m onkey org ruby on rack the 2the builder examples http blog ixti net development ruby understanding 20110903understanding rack builder but with that said after looking through the code it is easy to see why each is needed lesson learned plus i am adding rack lint tests 
thedarkone my ruby version is ruby p 320 192p320
i use rack 160 the test jodosha aade d d fb c e f c e 416aade700d258581d58fb9c5046e0f86129c09e passes successfully but the test aingvarf d b c c aebfcea b ade d0b636c979c2aebfcea10144557b788680391ade fails ie sends second post request with auth data and empty content but set header content type equal to firtst unauthorized request and content length 0 i suppose that parsing content should be avoided if header content length 0
all i did was update rack from 208 to 210 ran the specs and got some failures there was some middleware involved in my real case scenario yes however i managed to get a minimum example to reproduce the issue to provide that here w o any middleware and so on so that you can check that w o having to dig into a bigger app and stuff i don t think it s the responsibility of a middleware to get the content length right but rather the server however as there was nothing in the changelog about such change for 210 i would put that as a regression 
we re building ruby and the gems using just visual studio on the command line without using mingw 32 mingw32 or cygwin i know that s not the most highly supported platform but our situation does not allow for us to rely on those helper libraries

the memory use does increase regardless of object space objectspace each object but i see your point i actually first came across this because a small sinatra app running on thin fine on unicorn would bloat to mb 500mb ram overnight this is what i ended up tracing it to i believe evanphx has submitted a patch for this issue 
it happens more often now so pls help it s hard to describe the bug fully but there are some infos that you can imagine it starts progams by def start  cmd program handler programhandler and logger are predefined stdin stdout sterr wait thr open popen cmd open3popen3cmd event machine eventmachine attach stdout program handler programhandler logger end def stop  kill processes of programs that needs to stop  close stdout end the script does stoping starting many times and the bug happens when it starts a program or stops and starts a program again can you help to fix this thanks

hm why do you think that val should only be string  etc val liquid drop correct me if i wrong if i use a liquid methods in my models it will automatically generate liquid drop class proxy for instances of this class in this case i can add length to liquid methods and it will return length property of my model 
please consider it a feature request then 
oh gosh you are right i forgot the s at the end of code strip newlines code sorry for bothering you but it would be really great if this could be clarified in the documentation https github com shopify liquid wiki liquid for designers there it says  code strip newlines code  strip all newlines n from string maybe better would be  code strip newlines code  strip all newlines n or r n from string and another thing i d love being included somewhere is that you can use both single and double quotes like in javascript for filtering this can be important if you want to refer to single or double quotes in a filter string e g replace all double quotes with a single quote code replace  code or is it possible to use backslashes there e g code replace  code

salexzee thank you for following up yes correct that is what i have used to solve this issue for time being but according to shopify documentation and experts this is not a good practice we should be always be using asset url for all the assets files within style sheet you can get more reference from comment https ecommerce shopify com c ecommerce design t images url s in the style css file 109049 comment 109130 of jamie s jamies on shopify forum lets say in near future if shopify implements some folder structure or other thing for images and scss then it might break our style sheet

sure one thing i would like to do with it is send the current song to an irc channel how i do so in shell i will figure out i would like to have a hotkey instead of doing so every time the song changes because i skip music a lot and it would be spammish if everytime the song changes it got sent another possible use case would be to download the album art and open it thanks 
hi config is the one copied from github and i have this  the echo l is what i only added i m a beginner in bash so i m not sure if it s the script can also be the problem thanks

sorry posted this in the wrong thread will move to pianopub 
i applied the patch and got this error now i receiving new playlist network error unknown http status code it hangs on that i think perhaps if there s an error it would be better if it exited instead of hanging so the script can sleep for a few seconds and reconnect i m not sure if the error is because of a hiccup at pandora or my network 
it works for www pandora com connect www pandora com 443 http 11 host www pandora com 443 proxy connection close but not for connect tuner pandora com 443 http 11 host tuner pandora com 443 proxy connection close in my auto proxy settings i found another server internal tuner pandora com maybe it will work 
the patch i applied was this https gist github com 2500616 i m sorry i don t know what git head is man git wasn t much help clarifying pianobar s directory tree does contain this promy lo ph promyloph pianobar ed b 314ed2b accessing pandora via its url continued to work fine other services like last fm had no problems so it wasn t my connection or sound drivers etc the garbled stream lasted for 24 hours but is fine now i changed nothing restarted no daemons didn t reboot i thought i d report it in case anyone else had experienced this 
sorry just a standard port install of pianobar v 20120506 v20120506 itself  sudo port install pianobar computing dependencies for pianobar fetching archive for pianobar attempting to fetch pianobar darwin 201205060darwin x tbz 2 11x8664tbz2 from http packages macports org pianobar snip  pianobar welcome to pianobar 20120506 press for a list of commands i login ok i get stations ok snip 
if i have pianobar running while i create a new pandora station i m unable to play my new station until i restart pianobar and i would like to be able to refresh it without shutting it down and having to re login again 
look at the network traffic when i pause a song downloading stops unpausing does not cause it to resume when i skip a song next downloading continues but there is no output and pianobar shows that the current time in the song isn t moving 
i recently installed pulseaudio so maybe it s using that i don t have libao what do you recommend i try for default driver 
version 20130915
trying to emulate the control pianobar script on windows but since windows has no fif os fifos i thought a socket might work just as well it could even be just another element of your input fds array which you open add in main c and check in ui readlines c if you like i could submit a pr

hi tivie thanks for getting back to me so quickly yes exactly currently the contents is parsed as markdown i am indeed currently using a lang extension to workaround this problem but i believe that it will become increasingly common to have custom elements in our html and that support for this should be built in if you didn t want to treat all custom elements as block level one option would be to provide users with a configurable white list of matching element names to check 
sorry i guess i filed this too hastily looks like it s something else in my codebase stripping them

not any problem to access to constants defined on files on the folder billing gateways  i think is ok but the problems happen when you want to do special things like in the test i was talking about on my previous post

i understand about the abstraction and in this case would go with what the services prefer to call it they are closer to the f is fis and probably have a better handle on what things are called in the financial world after a quick google search it looks like descriptor would be better than description some call it billing descriptor transaction descriptor so statement descriptor seems to me like a good choice

most browsers allow third party cookies in the o auth oauth flow in the exchange of tokens etc dealing with sessions etc there is usually also a need to write cookies in this case most browsers work well however safari by default allows no third party cookies thus in any embedded app connection attempt when exchanging tokens and dealing with the sessions safaro chokes and the result is an o auth oauth failure labelled as csrf detected only by setting safari to allow cookies does the embedded app session get initialized properly

of course first of all i can not use symengine pow 22 for example that does not work because there is no function pow in symengine atleast if i do help symengine in the python console there is no mention of the pow function i should probably begin with two sentences i need a fast way of transforming the symbolic function in c code the reason why i need this is that the integrands that i construct are couple hundred lines long and at least in sympy that takes a long time to integrate and that s why i proceed numerically from there ok now to the c code part i m using ctypes to integrate a function because this way it s much faster for this i need to convert the function that i constructed symbolically into c code this takes a lot of time when i was searching for a faster way to do symbolic computation i ran into you guys symengine is build on cpp so the code is similar to c for example when i do sympy exp 2 in the python console it gives exp 2 but with symengine exp 2 it s e 2 so thats already very similar to what a c function should look like for faster integration i need the pow function with it i would not need the c code printer from sympy i just could use the output of the function i programm almost only in python maybe i should change that but for now and for a lot of other people that would be probably a good feature best wishes

it is working for edit action on custom edit action render field request not active no error on server on edit action log is following i t 175757002443 20140423t175757002443 2282 info  started post users render 3render field column num utf e c utf8e29c 93 for 192168198 at 20140423 175757 0800 i t 175757017410 20140423t175757017410 2282 info  processing by users controller userscontroller render field as i t 175757018006 20140423t175757018006 2282 info  parameters utf 8 utf8 record login sdr last login at 20140423 num 3000 num 1200 num1200 num 21800 num21800 source id record num 3 column num id 3 i t 175757075029 20140423t175757075029 2282 info  rendered home sdr rvm gems ruby bundler 211bundler gems active scaffold df d 5066df89173d app views active scaffold overrides render field js erb ms 81ms i t 175757075566 20140423t175757075566 2282 info  rendered home sdr rvm gems ruby bundler 211bundler gems active scaffold df d 5066df89173d app views active scaffold overrides render field js erb ms 172ms i t 175757075953 20140423t175757075953 2282 info  rendered home sdr rvm gems ruby bundler 211bundler gems active scaffold df d 5066df89173d app views active scaffold overrides render field js erb ms 327ms i t 175757076606 20140423t175757076606 2282 info  completed 200 ok in ms 58ms views ms 506ms active record activerecord ms 02ms but on custom action when change value in num field there is nothing in log my test app https github com sdr as test as34test

with a migration e g changing the underlying table
that is correct only an issue if you try to select contact for a contact that already has an account i d also find multiple accounts per contact useful however it would need to be clear in the ui when i am adding another account to a contact as opposed to moving a contact to another account

what this file is used for could someone explain more about it 
sorry but i do not have much time and should learn how to pull request for the next one 
i submitted pull request 365
yeah unfortunately max and min are implemented in c code here s max for instance  from https github com ruby ruby blob b f bff bed f a b ebf 9b94249f39bff401465340639bed1f2a93b62ebf enum c i m not familiar enough with ruby s c code to really grasp what s going wrong i do know this code is ultimately calling money though and that this method is working as expected i agree it s no biggy just to ensure the array is all money objects before hand that s how i m working around it it s just that this really caught me off guard because all the other comparison methods  etc work fine with a mixture of money objects and plain numbers the fact that max and min don t work as expected definitely breaks the rule of least surprise which probably isn t a good thing when working with financial transactions 
ok i looked deeper into the problem i didn t knew you took i n i18n rules into account already my current understanding is that before you took the i n i18n rules into account if present otherwise fell back to your own rules i assume with 6101 both things i ran in the bundle of my rails app but just with irb so i don t expect any tainting from our configuration or other gems only money was explicitly required the i n i18n rules are extracted from our rails app 
hi anstorm in my app in application rb i have deffined  if the fallback worked with the spanish translation the symbol should be the euros symbol and with my overriding it should be but none of those are been seen instead with the currency set to uyu i seen i hope this could clarify what i m doing how i think money fallback to i n i18n it s not working and help to improve the gem thanks mateo 
ok i don t mind i have done it in this moment thank you
yes i did restarted the server 
sure totally gtalk is the same as my github the run down is i can t reassign what the referencing table is when editing a polymorphic object i have a polymorphic image table that allows image to be attached to a bunch of things say a user when i edit an image http localhost admin 3002admin images edit 1 i can t change that relationship from user to say a person i have to remove the image and create it on a person would be nice if it allowed a drop down with a list of models that a polymorphic association can attach to 
i use the version 308 of typus my initializer settiings are the following require rails root lib myauth typus setup do config config authentication myauth config master role admin config relationship typus users config user class name user config user fk admin user id end
here is the configuration city fields default name priority active form name priority active order by priority name relationships filters name search name application dealzza thanks 
yes i tried with a datetime format thinking it was trying to perhaps format using the string but same result 
i have stuff in the admins namespace but not admin ie localhost admins 3000admins xxx that shouldnt affect it right

ah by accident was looking at another issue sorry 
i m not sure but i will just be cautious when naming template files 
the first two errors reported are indeed generated in that way the last one is triggered when raising an exception inside any render function when running a frontend application

hi have tried with rexml and nokogiri and am getting the same issue 
sorry it s type error typeerror with can t convert nil into string 
when using bundler behind proxy i need to set http proxy environment variable how to use bundler behind a proxy http stackoverflow com questions how 3877055how to use bundler behind a proxy  ruby s net http library load this environment value automatically if it is present net http http ruby doc org stdlib libdoc 200libdoc net http rdoc net http html that s why i d like to pass nil value to net http 
using net http from the console on heroku returns a http bad response httpbadresponse but doesn t seg fault open https www wdesk com blog daily grind office documents does seg fault
187 193 212 net http changed a bit but the concept was the same one could and should be able to pass nil to bypass environmental proxy it s like curl proxy google com core feature 
jnunemaker also gem ruby dep don t support ruby 190 min 200 i ve tried to resolve this dependency issues with  it s should work but it s a dirty hack to make it work but i m not sure that it s a good idea ruby 193 not longer supporting and many of gem stopped supporting it too i think will be better to stop support it for htt party httparty too 
we have detected the issue in a production proyect when we make a request to a external provider from our rails server using httparty we have changed from response response body encoding to response body encoding to solve the problem but it looks strange to us 
how to trace 
i did not use your overlay at all i ll double check the gst plugins just in case and i ll give a try to your overlay i ll also try with qt 59 but if demo works with 562 but i d like to keep 562 as it s the official i mean for gentoo stable one for now 
probably not  291 the same problem qca is installed but it s not recognized i ve added path to qca and now qca is detected i use others programs with qca qt 5 qt5 okular konversation without problems for example konversation git version  ubuntu debian arch fedora have a qca qt 5 qt5 packages in a repo i think that psi requires qca qt 5 qt5 instead of qca 
i installed it on osx i set rvm to ruby 187 and used gem install radiant prerelease i generated two sites one with the blog and another with coffee roasters because i was thinking it was related to the content i got the same error in both cases everything seem to be ok except when i open an item on the content menu maybe it s a version thing with my installed gems tom brooke on thu jun 2 2011 at 329 am spanner reply reply github com wrote 
will put it on my todo list thanks for helping 
john thanks for the help i updated to the latest radiant fron github i haven t tested the app on heroku yet because i lost my style and js it looks like the pre 100pre sheets extension is not working right any ideas

hey benny thanks for the clarification makes sense i ll swap out my fork with upstream 101 and see if i can figure out why that s going on guessing this is due to the combination of the site i m upgrading and its old extensions so it s gotta be something in there is name something that gets passed in from an extension s config i m grasping at straws here without looking at the code directly ha
sorry this is with 0137
i stand corrected thank you still if there isn t an issue with doing a local tmp or tmp plus random number to prevent collisions it would be easier to write cross platform code rather than having to detect the system and then use different environment variables depending on platform 
hi rafael nice to hear from you it really depends on what the sub commands load of course my subcommands are provided by other gems so i don t really have influence of their loading behaviour i do get your point tho i can also just tell my other gem implementers to have good gem manners and use autoload 
just forget about it thanks 
rafaelfranca working x 10x 
that s right it pops up a warning about the domain mismatch and let you proceed 
well yesterday i watched the two networking talks from s 2010s wwdc where they mentioned that the defaul nsurl request nsurlrequest timeout is 60 seconds i double checked it still is i m guessing apple have a reason for choosing it to be this large i think it s because on the i phone iphone it can take a number of seconds for the link to become active again so if you timeout too soon just as the cell wifi becomes active then the app will be returning an error unnecessarily and draining battery additionally i don t think there is anything to be lost having a longer timeout as while the request is sat waiting when implemented correctly it s just waiting for an event to fire and shouldn t be blocking any threads i appreciate the framework is for macs too but from developing my own app i m finding that on the simulator having 10 as the default is not a problem at all but on the device when the link is significantly more variable it times out quite a lot i ve only recently just changed the default to 60 to see how it goes so not sure what it should be yet i suspect somewhere between 60 does sound like a long time on a related note i ve not looked through asihttp request asihttprequest enough yet but does it automatically retry requests that fail 
methods mock and stub work fine as does expects and stubs just using require mocha in my rspec files 
sorry it s an issue with rvm gemsets i tried on a different machine without a gemset and the tests pass odd 
ruby version ruby p 180 192p180 20110218 revision 30909 x darwin 1060 x8664darwin1060 let me check on a blank application for you and update here 
yes it did fix the issue although i guess it isn t a total fix as respond to might rely on external state it will certainly get most of the way there thanks 
brainstorming with my co workers on how you could reproduce without sharing sourcecode thx 
using for my app myapp my app myapp works though it creates a new class called my app myapp my app myapp which is definitely not what i want 
i am getting overlap in the example code overlap http i imgur com dy sd png dysd1png on pre http i imgur com e dc a edc5a png 
didn t know there was a yuidoc json key option it s been pretty buggy using certain styles of the config but i have other things that matter more if i have time to go in and reduce the bugs i ll re open
yes the namespace tag is there in my doc block 
hi thanks got solved it was actually creating a new database because the old was not getting copied into the correct location hence no table was found 
setting only active arch no hasn t changed anything my current workaround is running the following before i run xcodebuild even though sqlite c sqlite3c is configured for x 86 x86 it appears to work in my i os ios app xcodebuild still complains about the c compiler but because the file already exists it continues building the app 
hello sjlombardo i don t quite know what was happening because i can t reproduce it now i m really sorry for the inconvenience i didn t dream the errors above and started tweaking sqlcipher xcodeproj only after they occurred but now when i reset the sql cipher sqlcipher repo to v 331 v331 no error is happening i was trying to build the stock v 331 v331 sql cipher sqlcipher without sqlite enable update delete limit sorry again and thank you 
before x code xcode 9 is work ok it is error in fm database fmdatabase the function sqlite rekey sqlite3rekey and sqlite key sqlite3key can t be called in x code xcode 9 i want to know how to solve the problem thank you 
i m sorry i thought this function is in sql cipher sqlcipher only however it seems it s a bug in upstream sq lite sqlite in 3311 but as sqlite has codec is unsupported and already removed in the master branch i don t think reporting it to them makes sense are you planning to revert removing sqlite has codec if so when you ll upgrade sq lite sqlite the next time please be aware of this bug and check proper usage of sqlite uri sqlite3uri parameter in 3320 there will be a helper function sqlite create sqlite3create filename which can be used to create a string with the proper memory layout that sqlite uri sqlite3uri parameter can use 
again no demo for this as well b c of it only sitting on my company s internal network at the moment right i wrapped the img lazy lazyload call inside another method which i call after i have a successful response hopefully the width height thing outlined in 80 is the cause of this problem 
yeah isolate namespace was implemented the same way in 32 https github com rails rails blob baf ee ef b c c aeadc railties 4baf145375ee4ef712799b0c96c2aeadc5060015railties lib rails engine rb l 379 l379 but in 31 it doesn t look like it was the same way exactly https github com rails rails blob cb b a c c cdd f d railties 171173122887cb35b60432a79c5c34cdd36f18d5railties lib rails engine rb l 359 l359 here is the commit going from 31 to 32 https github com rails rails commit fd a b b df d bdcd a a e f 4 fd86a1b6b068df87164d5763bdcd4a323a1e76f4 so they just accessed things more directly instead of defining an explicit contract 
that works though it s missing this commit https github com apotonick cells commit d c fef f f ca b f ba 42794 08d85c79fef301f5f23419ca095b2f802ba42794 it also takes a while to detect changes with the code from this repo template changes are picked up instantly and cell rb changes aren t picked up at all using your branch changes in both are picked up but it takes numerous requests to get the new code i am using a vagrant docker setup to develop which means nfs is involved but again template changes would happen instantly with this repo weird 
ok thank you 
it would probably be most useful in java enterprisey environments where just about everything is deployed in zip files often nested ones for instance if you want to compare a properties file or an xml file contained in a war file you need to either unzip it or know where the app server unzipped it and some of them don t do that

thank you i ve tested your approach last week and i think this will work fine in my situation 
from the manual thanks vadym
oh that s good to hear x 14x is the latest version in the redhat repositories what version do you have maybe there s an additional repository hosting more recent rpms i noticed that epel is referenced in the docs but i don t see the augeas rpms as being present there  i was currently looking for a workaround and it seems that the php lns lens is able to parse it correctly it s pretty nasty though so i prefer to use updated packages 
this is happens when i press ctrl x ctrl o first time
seems to help for my testcase i ll close this in the hope that nothing depended on the original change thanks for your fast response 
nope but while searching i found that i had set regexpengine 1 and that was causing it if that s also unsupported feel free to close this 
yes this is now working with b c 5 87b25c5 thanks again 
hi i can no longer reproduce the issue with python 3 python3 o which is actually how it should be from the python help output o optimize generated bytecode slightly also pythonoptimize x oo remove doc strings in addition to the o optimizations i must have had some environment variable setting pythonoptimize somewhere when i first tried it as the problem is still reproducible and rightly so with python 3 python3 oo whether or not that s an issue worth working on is up to you 
i was actually hoping that something more user friendly could be done about it that s a very awkward method to send a direct message it would be nice if there were a simpler interface for it 
hi radar it must be one of the gems i have causing this i ll need to add them to a demo app one by one to figure out which one is causing this this might take a while sweat smile closing the issue for the time being
i tried to update the gem and receive the same error in the 0660 version and the file is there
i have just used gem install curb
rake aborted don t know how to build task rdoc is what i am getting when i dont have a rdoc task and if i dont have a rdoc directory total size is 0 speedup is 000 rsync error some files attrs were not transferred see previous errors code 23 sender 305 rake aborted command failed with status 23 rsync av delete rdoc grosser rubyforge so i needed to add rdoc task and add an rdoc directory
erm yes it looks as though you re right about the gem sources it would however be a good move to use gemcutter gems or even the gem bundler for development dependencies 
ys b was just what i was looking for just trying to understand it though what does represent never mind i found that it s move to end of line 
bump when will 203 be released 
when you build an app for i os ios to publish via command line in i phone iphone settings there is options for app with one single option show log on off i dont want and i cant manually delete the settings xml from the app in xcode as i always build command line i think the same issue have all those who build in rhohub this settings option is useless and is raising questions between app users i think would be wise either to remove it in prudction release builds or make an option in rhomobile for removing it off 
this issue is only when the app is compiled with 51 sdk and are running on ios 6 ios6 i tried to use the 51 sdk to solve the rotation bug but it break the camera i will close this issue

looks good to me that was minus the refactoring more or less what i was thinking about doing thanks for the fast response 
sorry just upgraded the main message see if you can help me thank you 
oh i m sorry ruby 222 rails 425
hey jmettraux this is my first time using it while researching the issue i have seen an issue similar to the one i am having pop up in previous versions 303 and puma 292 for example it seems updating puma to a new version fixed the issue in one of those instances however i believe i have the most recent gems for both installed and i am still having the issue 
maybe the problem could be solved if for every attribute all the activerecord error messages are set but with many models and attributes this is a hell of a lot of work instead i use generic activerecord error messages which are just fine the classes can be found here http gist github com 132526 i get the following error message 
all my shoulda specs fails  rest of specs passes 
i can t reproduce this from either but you can see it with firebug here http jinsei ygamretuta me search q d however note that for a couple of requests to that page the pjax does not fire i am working on that however the firebug console tab should display the error
gibson 042 gibson042 sure it may be intended to be called with element nodes but sizzle being used by j query jquery makes sizzle so pervasive that its inevitable that it will be used in unpredictable ways so sizzle ought to safeguard itself against such uses instead of throwing an error in this case a simple things like looping over the children of a node and passing them via sizzle could lead to errors if even one of the children is a non element node given that checks for non element safety seem essential if it is not desirable to fix it only in this spot is there an issue open for treating this as a comprehensive fix 
yes its here https gist github com 1616242 cant find why it dont work properly 
ok i tried and confirmed that reverting https github com eventmachine eventmachine commit c f c a ae cf b 49352 3c39365435f45c534a317779ae33cf1242b49352 fixed the problem so it seems like a regression indeed 
sorry for the delay i saw this commit and debugged until the client options clientoptions the line that stopped doesn t have any proxy attribute so i gave up of this branch and reverted my changes i reverted back to 030 version in a near future i will try again and post my results here 
i have a test that reproduces the error in my gem which is just a small wrapper around this gem for making parallel http requests https github com rcarvalho parallel http if you clone this gem and run rake test you will see the error if you want to see a hack that i put in my own gem that will fix this just uncomment lines 41 46 and 50 in parallel http rb and run the test again and see it pass it essentially ignores the call to errback if a call had already been made to callback 
i wrote a quick cgi script to replicate it it s up here https makethingsmakesense com bogus redirect cgi try hitting it and you ll see the crash this will fix it https github com doriantaylor em http request blob master lib em http client rb l 104 l104 but i m not sure if it s the most sensible solution 
tml yeah that would work perfectly 
vote for dropping the unused feature before r 6 r6
either ignoring or creating a hash element  true should be fine 
there is no workaround when you use scala run from the command line imho the run target should not re use the args option which has the add to the call of the favorite scalac tool semantic 
as example https stackoverflow com questions annotation 36407543annotation processor output path sbt
i ve updated the sample project with a basic sbt multi project build using sbt 133 which uses the same zinc compile 131 dependency can t reproduce with repeated sbt compile invocations 
i had a look at the other keys but i am honestly not sure where they are used my thought was that maybe they are used only in the default scaffold error pages but that doesn t seem to be the case looking at the mongoid yml file they have a validations key which seems to serve the same purpose as record invalid again maybe because the default record invalid key was in the activerecord section so they thought they needed their own equivalent personally i don t think it would cause any trouble to move record invalid as well but i cannot be sure 
i found problem in active record error message text its not in english i would update it as per my understanding and send you a patch 
sure i wasn t really certain so i asked first in case someone else knew better 
just do a select all on this issue page it triggers it for me i think almost any github page will trigger it possibly because of the icon fonts but that s just speculation on this particular page the error i get is error x e 1 xe1 on us ascii 
i am able to reproduce it with a very minimal file 
just off the top of my head i can think of git google chromium vlc media player transmission bittorrent client gnome desktop environment kde desktop environment the archliux wiki has a longer and incomplete list at https wiki archlinux org index php xdg base directory support
thanks karenetheridge for your quick reply i was trying to customerize the basic bundle and realized that i removed make maker makemaker from the list after i added make maker makemaker into the list dzil test worked my intention was i don t need make maker makemaker but i need test runner testrunner which i manually added to dist ini i ll take a closer look at the make maker makemaker code and see if i can do this thanks again 
actually i heard mixed reactions to this kind of builder problem but i have not investigated yet what s the root cause if rails if ruby if the weather outside the window anyway not relying on it might be a good idea at this point 
symphonic john symphonicjohn we upgraded the recaptcha gem once and things seemed to have improved but have gone downhill again 
i can t really but i can say that i have this at the top  bin sh the real issue is that the project is hosted on github and when the build is run on window the script file is downloaded and eol chars are set appropriately windows crlf  i initially thought that i could manage this by forcing the file to be dos unix dos2unix d but it looks like we will have to resolve this by fixing our git setup 
both boxes runs on java 16045 maven maven 311
yes i did just a jar ok the issue is jdeb works on package phase but if jar is already packaged without package phase for example through maven assembly plugin it does not include anything okay i ll try to rebuild project without this plugin i ll respond what i got upd if using maven jar plugin with packaging stage everything works fine 
yes i m using
i ve only tested it on 192 on sun mar 20 2011 at 347 am stffn reply reply github com wrote 
in your readme you are saying that one can set the instance variable for a resource if using the attribute check together with filter access to and that you will use this instance variable for the attribute check but this is not true you are actually not even checking for its existence in your app https github com stffn declarative authorization blob master lib declarative authorization in controller rb l 633 l633 one has to pass the load method parameter and even worse using filter resource access one can t even pass a load method so one has to use filter access to all and then pass the load method for all resourceful actions by hand not even setting the load blah method in a before filter is working understanding this whole attribute check thing costs me hours of work sorry for these harsh words but that really pissed me off so please update you readme and wiki files 
on the css file there are several references to images for the arrows at least on current stable code not rc code of the plugin should not be modified and instead should be used as is allowing to the user to customize it outside regarding to this i think this references should be on another css file and let jquery tree table treetable css just for the core basis hide show and similar 201326 ludo van den boom notifications github com  si quieres viajar alrededor del mundo y ser invitado a hablar en un monton de sitios diferentes simplemente escribe un sistema operativo unix  linus tordvals creador del sistema operativo linux
i made some research and found that my problem was styling i added even row styling which caused chrome browser to become unresponsive for a some time that s my style rule  disabling this fixed my problem

this is what i did 1 i installed gist vim using vundle i am on ubuntu 12041 lts 2 configured git by adding my github user name 3 gist l asked whether i want to use simple auth or the other one i chose simple auth and gave password for the github account 4 i got the list of gists created by me 5 i opened the top item using enter which is this https gist github com 3750257 6 i tried w this is where i get post failed i suspect the content has something to do with this problem see if you are not able to reproduce with the content of the gist i think it is possible to fork a gist right if you find it impossible to repro please let me know how i can get you additional details like debug log etc if you guide me i can also try debugging it although i never debugged a vim script 
i got it to work by copying gist vim from another environment but starting from scratch it wont work
thanks i given up not because of this plugin just because this company disables git curl etc

hi nick as i dug into this issue my initial working theory was that the server was intermittently issuing me new jsessioni ds jsessionids to test this theory i modified my inspect session method to make noise if jsessionid changed at any point during the test  my test showed that jsessionid never changed after it was first set even though the session dropping behavior was still apparent 
nick thanks for replying actually the issue is that we don t expect at 404 but somehow the response capture responsecapture gets a 404 and then resets the session even more odd is that even though the response capture is a 404 our app works as expected except for the inability to write to cookies chris

what plumatic schema https github com plumatic schema is my sample code  macro define an api function this automatically does several things  calls auto parse to automatically parse certain args e g id is converted from string to integer via integer parse int parseint  converts route from a simple form like id to a typed one like id id 09 sequentially applies specified annotation functions on args to validate them  automatically calls wrap response if needed on the result of body tags function s metadata in a way that subsequent calls to define routes see below will automatically include the function in the generated defroutes form  generates a super sophisticated markdown formatted docstring
i have not linked my project to the libhpdfd lib or libhpdf lib yet i think i still need to compile these first with libharu at least i cannot find these files in the libharu master folder at this stage 
thanks for your information
i had problems recreating that too in isolation i just figured out it was the active support activesupport railtie setting the default zone that triggers it 
no problem i found out about https github com brynary rack test and used mock requests to test my api which works well with timecop thank you for your response 
ok so i set up https github com synth travis timecop and https travis ci org synth travis timecop but its passing there so perhaps there is something else in my application that is fudging things around i will look more at reproducing the issue in this example repo later when i get a bit more time 
got it working now i used to run b 3 b3 successfully over half a year a go since then you ve dropped python 26 python26 support and as i m on cent os centos i had to build python 27 python27 myself python worked fine however the python packages were not present in the 27 installation which caused the issue i posted here to solve the problem i copied the site packages directory from python 26 into 27 i imagine this may cause issues for certain packages but i believe it is working as solution for now thanks 
in this context it is more appropriate to have the answer be hapana i will go ahead and add a pull request i don t want to make a new issue post so i want to ask if i could add zambia as well zambia has english as the official language but bemba and nyanja are the most often used local languages in bemba no is aweh and yes is eya in nyanja no is nothing and yes is iyayi 
i either supplied binaries dll or build them as i could import the module i don t remember right now as the process wasn t straightforward sorry to note that i removed the package i needed it for a gtk project zim that offered spellchecker feature but i removed all gtk related stuff from my python packages after i build zim executable enchant was pygtkspell dependency
hi thanks for answering so quickly indeed i m storing a duration i use mysql since i can t migrate on rails 3 yet is there a workaround thakns

hi brezerk i m pasting the output  thanks 
hello darkk in the real world it is quite common that you don t want to or can t use tor ex when you are using proxies to manage access your own private infrastructure but that is not the only case i can also imagine me sitting behind a http proxy trying to access my socks server somewhere in the world in order to do it i have to make two hops that is why i think it would be great if redsocks allowed me to do it proxy chaining is supported by some other proxifiers like proxychains proxifier widecap in theory it should be possible to make redosocks running with proxychains but still i think it would be great to have that functionality in one box
this is the correct one cat etc config redsocks conf base log debug on log info off daemon on redirector iptables  redsocks local ip 192168102 local port 1081 ip 127001 listenq 256 port 1080 type socks 5 socks5 port 8081 type direct type http connect login gaeproxy password gaeproxy  redsocks local ip 192168102 local port 1082 ip 19216810216 type socks 5 socks5 port 9050 type http connect login gaeproxy password gaeproxy  note i extended this tool with a new direct method so that no proxy is required the implementation is simple basically do nothing in relay but invoking start relay on read write callback it has a customized connect relay method to connect to destination directly i will post my code changes here when i got access to my code

thanks for the response 1 the only fluxbox specific variable i found was desktop session which is set to fluxbox 2 thanks for the hint i fixed that by uninstalling chrome and install chrome beta i saw that this issue was recently fixed in chrome now both xdg open and launchy opens the url in chrome alone 
yep everything seems fine it was just the deprecation warning 
yes i use another i n i18n gem too thanks

kou you can pull any gem and then try to compile it  it will crash
i see this is interesting but i m not sure what the cause is yet this is far from a i minimal i repro but the steps to reproduce using the grpc package build is  please let me know if there are any problems with this repro

avatar url i want access to user avatar trought view or model and send to browswer trought web socket
so i was building a rails app to reproduce the problem and turns out that the problem was related to my custom id field not accepting a null value via migration with the null false in the options so if my save method inside the standard make method from machinist gem failed the folowing reload method would fail as well since active record fills such field with 0 zero on it when saving fails 
thank you
sigh i did but i had a typo false alarm and thanks for the followup 
i have now switched to watchr myself as its great that you can easily create your own custom scripts so we can just close this for the time being cheers alastair

here comes the test case https github com krisdigital rack cache dragonfly 16dragonfly test case the error seems only to occur if the item is not cached that is why i clear the cache before the test you should see an output like the following when running rake test 
1 the plugin generated does not create the new line 2 the assumption was that i should get the same exact output as the command line run of the yuicompressor jar 3 the issue only arises when running diffs i believe this becomes more of an issue in some source control systems like git when doing diffs

a f 65 3a73f65 was the original bugfix that changes array to array ea 14370 ea14370 completely wipes that section of the code out so i thought it was the culprit but looking at it again it seems like the pushed 147 gem doesn t even contain a f 65 3a73f65 the original bugfix maybe you accidentally pushed an older version to 147 can you tell me which commit the pushed 147 gem corresponds to

sickill i don t know this is easy to reproduce by creating a rails project with a gemfile that contains rubocop and colorize and then run rake rubocop i solved the issue by switching to rainbow from colorize in my gemfile maybe the bug is that rubo cop rubocop should not be doing the monkeypatching but once it s done

i m happy to help though my experience with creating and or maintaining gems is quite limited the change breaks nothing on any platform since it is a pure ruby change and it only does a double require with exception catching i can think of a couple of ways to help  i can build the gem got ragel working and provide a gem that people could download and install locally on ruby 24 i can take on the role of maintainer but will need some help if you don t mind there have been no updates to the gem in 4 years so maybe the maintenance effort is relatively small

first could you please explain why dvdauthor input xml file and dvdunauthor output xml file do not have the same schemas i think i ve read maybe in the ml that dvdunauthor was in advance compared to dvdauthor the former being able to describe more dvd features than the latter can you confirm for what follows i will suppose that you do from what i read in the source the xml structure is verified by a manually build tag allowed children tags allowedchildrentags callback associations so i would propose 4 steps 1 confirm that the dvdauthor xsd is in sync with the output of dvdunauthor if not fix it so that everyone could have a common reference 2 update the tag allowed children tags allowedchildrentags callback associations to match the schema of dvdunauthor using empty callbacks for missing features 3 update dvdauthor output xml file to be in sync with the fixed dvdauthor xsd 4 implement the empty callbacks introduced in 2 what do you think

not moving the flash object just including it with swf tag and not using javascript class option i m not sure what you mean by loaded but it does show up in the developer tools  no javascript error in the console it just display the background color in the non working case when it s working it first shows the background color and then loads the video player 
the whole project basically we d send you the maintainer a financial contribution in exchange for a link logo on the readme saying something like development for feedbag has been partially sponsored by superfeedr this helps us get some visibility and hopefully also helps your users find tools they can use to fetch parse feeds 
well the reason why it is archived is because there is an input file and i wonder what is the problem with the archive hm well let s see  which after decoding will turn into bug 0000000000000
your idea looks quite good it enables recursion automatically and offers the advanced user a quite handy mechanism the only drawback that i see is that it may be harder to implement but the advantages are i think worth it 
yes i did the license txt is the x 11 x11 license http directory fsf org wiki license x 11 x11 it contains a paragraph on trademark that the expat one does not the osi s mit one is the expat not the x 11 x11 srokap i know the plugins are gp lv 2 gplv2 only and that s a problem ewinslow already commented in 5239 that brettp might know more about the situation and cash is aware of the issue of non distributability of derived works due to the lack of core plugin functionality in the mit releases so far the feedback i received from the elgg foundation http elgg org led me to thinking the issue lies somewhere else i m planning on writing to thematic networks to get a clear position on the licensing of elgg because i need to solve that issue i decided to propose it to the lorea assembly https n cc 1cc decision view 1742445 and in a week we ll see what to do about it once it s solved either way of the licensing we know whether we can go on contributing to the mainline i e integrating our functionality into elgg core or if we re required to rewrite the missing functionality i e duplicate elgg core functionality e g groups to avoid licensing issues or just walk away unlikely at this time because of our existing inhabitants in any case it seems to me that a clear position on licensing including clearing the confusion between mit x expat x11expat and gp lv 2 gplv2 or gp lv 2 gplv2 would help focus on better cooperation 
superbe mrclay that worked thank you quick on what is the expedted release of elgg 20
iionly i just uploaded the contents of zip downloaded from the site jeabakker the elgg version is the latest available to download in the site php is version 57 azure allows me to choose from 56 to something 7something iionly in this case all i have is an ftp to upload files i don t have any kind of server access is a paa s paas option a web server as a service i just tried to upload the files and start up the installation azure provides us with a iis server with a local my sql mysql integrated and a php my admin phpmyadmin installed as i needed this fast to show to some folks at my company i installed it on a ubuntu virtual machine and that worked just fine it would be nice if someone with more php experience could check how to use azure paa s paas to deploy this it s free for a basic web site with my sql mysql and gb 10gb there is also one click setups for a lot of good products out there example https azuremarketplace microsoft com en us marketplace apps mono software monosoftware mono x monox tab overview 
version 23 yes the username is stored correctly
jdalsem i upgraded elgg versions one at a time elgg 19 then to 110 to 111 112 then finally 23 everything seemed to work normally immediately after upgrade but a few weeks later i realized that when new members were signing up or registering to the site the log browser utility did not show any log events for new users a logbrowser plugin that allows the admin to browse the system event log has always been active elgg log https log1https user images githubusercontent com ab e 26890413891254176ab729e b 429b e f 11e8961f dea eeccb 481dea2eeccb jpg 
i checked none of the caches were enabled enabling almost all the recommened caches seem to improve the thing very marginlly not sure but the inconsistent behavior persists 
i think the change from milli to nano is outside the scope of this particular request millisecond granularity is an assumption that pervades the current implementation and the normalization is something that can be completed independent of units i will go ahead and make the pull request for the normalization keeping millisecond granules 
the absolute numbers aren t particularly significant but in short lived streams about 25 of materialization time is spent on stage name stagename method and about 8 on create flow name createflowname here are some raw timing numbers from serving a few million requests columns are method source file time including methods called time excluding methods called 
yeah that sounds good 
drewhk thanks for pointing this out here s the code if anyone needs it 
i don t think it is composable from existing crd ts crdts it may have the same state as a g counter gcounter but the state of the g counter gcounter is private akka there s no way to inspect each nodes counter value g counter gcounter only exposes the summed values of all the nodes as a public value so the only way to implement it outside of the akka codebase is from scratch 
we are using 2311
oh sorry yes it is a duplicate i believe i missed it when searching because i added persistence persistent to the search query i don t think it should but how it is now it continues silently leading me to believe that everything was okay and having to make sure the persistent actor persistentactor on the other system was correctly persisting the events 
ah my bad i think i had a problem with imports in a multi module sbt project that is getting very heavy and didn t see it thanks again for all the great work 
oh interesting makes sense yes default case would be fine i m sure shall i cook up a pr or i can test on this end once one is put together thanks 
at the time it seemed to be shutting down the actor system before the mailboxes were processed 
buffer takes n items at a time and pass this to a function n window takes a moving window of n items and pass this to a function n
sure i can thanks patriknw
patriknw yes the behavior that i see is different from what you are describing i have a small test program that creates a tail chopping pool tailchoppingpool of size 3 then the test sends 9 messages to pool s actor ref actorref if the tail chopping pool tailchoppingpool were implemented as you are suggesting then each of the actors in the pool should receive exactly 3 requests because the first 3 request will be distributed in some random order to the 3 actors and then next 3 requests should be distributed again in a possibly different order and so on but what i observe is that on some test runs one actor receives more than 3 messages while others receive less than 3 my guess is that this is a defect in the implementation of tail chopping pool tailchoppingpool but i still do not understand the intended behavior of the class well enough to say for certain if it is a defect or simply my misunderstanding of what this type of pool is supposed to do what do you think i can post the source code for my test program if you think that would help 
i see i wish i had it in the logs but i dont what is the safest way to consume the entity for logging purposes without affecting the rest of the code 
sorry patriknw i should have mentioned that sigterm int when using artery in remote cluster leaving run by jvm shutdown hook on as per default i guess what i am looking for is the correct way one is expected to shutdown the artery transport if you want to avail of coordinated shutdown org agrona concurrent sig int sigint register new runnable override def run unit cluster leave cluster self address selfaddress  seems to do the trick for me but is this the right way is there another way i feel that part of the documentation would benefit for some further clarification

yeah can do that last week ish has been busy so it may take a day or two for me to pull things together 
not for now are you planning to have a new distro any time soon 
oops yes i do sorry for the ambiguity

raboof by splitting i meant using flow ops flowops split when splitwhen or flow ops flowops split after splitafter which return sub flow subflow you supply elem  boolean to split when splitwhen split after splitafter to do splitting but if it is stateful it s not safe because it will be shared between different materialisations 
since the java base stream basestream doesn t make a distinction between resource backend streams and regular streams it seems like it might be a bit surprising to get a resource leak from using from java stream fromjavastream in any case another example would be files lines http docs oracle com javase docs 8docs api java nio file files html lines java nio file path but i the same issue would apply for example to some library that provides streams of database rows all that said though it occurred to me that in any kind of resource backed java stream the operations are most likely blocking and should be wrapped in a future right in that sense wrapping the stream using unfold resource async unfoldresourceasync would perhaps be the way to go it should be possible to avoid the allocation of a per element option by writing a proper adapter so i suggest  add a note to from java stream fromjavastream documentation warning that it will not call close on stream completion and optionally add stream converters streamconverters from java stream async fromjavastreamasync or from java stream resource async fromjavastreamresourceasync bit of a mouthful based on either an adapter or unfold resource async unfoldresourceasync which takes care of resource management what do you think 
do you recommend using a new version of akka actor does akka have a newer version of akka actor 210 that uses scala library x 211x 
working on a reproducer persist is getting called in a future could that be the issue 
i explicitly wrote the precise versions again all akka jars are 211249
yes i m working on it right now
yes will do that 
sure jrudolph closing this in favor of https github com akka akka http issues 1178
might be possible but source actor ref actorref is very straight forward and simple solution for our use case switching to source queue would probably add a lot complexity since we need to register the actor source as listener 
i do share the same worry about complexity perhaps we should just focus on the single type that is most generalizable the one to one operator flow function flowfunction for now the pass through is the first and most obvious use base i can come up with for flow function flowfunction it itself is quite general though it would certianly be useful in the various alpakka connectors that currently have to implement their own pass through like mechanism kafka s flexi flow flexiflow for example https doc akka io docs akka stream kafka current producer html producer as a flow often when dealing with graphs i notice that we may want to conditionally run an element through a flow stage if it meets some condition by having the guarantee of a one to one flow stage we could create a wrapper flow stage around flow function flowfunction in out turning it into a flow function flowfunction either out in out if the input is of type right in it will run it through the given flow stage if the input is of type left out it will short circuit the passed in flow function flowfunction and simply unwrap the type to an out i have noticed the desire for this pattern in two cases 1 when consuming messages off kafka we may decide that the kafka message is not worth processing cannot be parsed no useful contents etc but we still want to track its offset and commit it later order must be preserved in this case so we can t depend on zip or merge with basic flow in out for a short circuit 2 when patching together an api that has many dependencies we may want to short cricuit the critical path if say authentication fails short circuit to a 401 turns out there are no results short circuit to a 204 etc currently we can do this by throwing exceptions and blowing up the graph but there are several downsides to that a graph completely composed of flow function flowfunction stages could be used in a nice black box kind of way by leveraging source queue and sink queue we could materialize a flow function flowfunction a b into a function a future b this would play very nicely with the rest of the scala ecosystem one of the issues linked above 22975 discusses projecting a value from a tuple although it is jumbled into the other pass through tickets it seems like a bit of a different use case to me allowing us to enrich a single element of a tuple while preserving the rest i looked through the other open git hub github issues in t stream and nothing popped out to me but i m curious if anyone else has any ideas too 
concurrent means that 2 akka connections between same 2 nodes are active at the same time for example tcp 6 tcp6 0 431 103017013658204 10301701042550 established java 12106java tcp 6 tcp6 0 0 103017013642848 10301701462550 established java 12106java tcp 6 tcp6 0 0 10301701362550 103017014640140 established java 12106java member 1 136 above has simple unidirectional connection with member 2 104 but double bidirectional connection with member 3 146 after member 3 restarts this double or concurrent connection is always present when we see a restarting member failing to join the cluster so we wonder whether there is a relation between the double connection and the failure 
we are building framework where we expect different parts of code will spawn required actors every such a piece of code will take care of actor s lifecycle but ultimately in the end we want to shutdown everything there we want to stop all the actors created using this actor system with the approach you have suggested we have to introduce stop message and every actor needs to handle that we might not have control over enforcing that constraint it is fine in this case if we shutdown all the children as system is going down and it is ok if actor gets terminated even though it has some messages left in its inbox 
i ve seen this on 2511
johanandren my use case is to use akka persistence as a simple event journal which i can use with persistence query so the actors have no state they are just a mechanism to write incoming events to a journal guess you could argue it s a use case that akka persistence was not really meant for 
i opened a pr for this i would add a test if i could think of a good way to test it it is tricky because the message for the entity needs to be processed before start entity startentity it is relatively easy to test with a full scale system which is how i found this issue 
sure i should be able to come up with a pr with a fix sometime later this week however i might need some guidance on how to write unit tests for it as i have no experience with test kit testkit and reproducing the race condition on shared buffer sharedbuffer polling might be non trivial 
cluster leaving was graceful from cassandra  i guess i can try to fix this myself 
i can try but i haven t contributed to this codebase before may take a while to figure it out 
lacasseio in case you were still waiting for the stacktrace though you probably have already got it by running the example that i provided org gradle api tasks task execution exception taskexecutionexception execution failed for task project a compile kotlin compilekotlin caused by org gradle api gradle exception gradleexception compilation error see log for more details 61 more 
one example for me at least it does add yet another way to do something but i think it would be helpful in certain places where a method is going to be invoked once 
bmuschko i do have an interest but no free time sorry 
that s right ben we have a single project that still works fine but in our multiproject test we re now getting the provided jars in the war and included in the copy task the reduced example i provided gives you all the code so you don t need to go hunting my guess is that it s got to do with this https github com daniel thomas danielthomas provided reduced blob master build src buildsrc src main groovy provided base plugin providedbaseplugin groovy l l 47 l44l47
ok i am going to do this tomorrow with a single module about create any test classes which fail is when some assertion fails by the moment my unique way to see the error stack trace is through jenkins 
ok do you mean that i can use the following workaround to bypass the issue https github com apache groovy commit eb d bcfaeb d d e ac ceb cff 78918eb1d91bcfaeb8d02258d26e7ac53ceb4cff
eriwen i was able to reproduce the issue with gradle 31 and gradle 321 on windows 10 1511 i have created a minimal sample project to repro the issue at https github com alexanderfloh javadoc issue repro after running gradlew javadoc take a look at the contents of build docs javadoc index html the title is title title it seems to me that this is already incorrectly encoded in the javadoc options file written by the gradle plugin navigating to build tmp javadoc javadoc options you ll see lines like thanks for looking into this let me know if you need anything else 
unfortunately i do not have a reliable way to reproduce the problem big guy did you spot anything of note when you looked at the heap dumps i included i agree with emartynov my co workers and i have been seeing a lot more oom issues with the x 5x releases than we saw with the high x 4x releases one of the issues we ran into was that we were using an older version of pmd with a newer version of gradle pmd by default used to log everything at the finest level when executing in the context of gradle ant they recently fixed this so that pmd respects the logging level of gradle causing far fewer logs to be produced by updating pmd inside our build to the newest version we have stopped seeing oom issues if i get another heap dump with gradle i ll report it here 
huxi i saw that as well but we re not invoking the gradle build gradlebuild task anywhere in our pipeline are you thinking this might still be related maybe behind the scenes in some way 
bmuschko unfortunately my knowledge of gradle is not sufficient for this task also link to the design document is broken 
yes bmuschko this is just about new lines you can see it in the pastebin that was linked however 
maybe also jnizet can say something his pr added the feature as it is now and eskatos reviewed and merged it 
i m sorry i was wrong about i love subdirectories bin that works fine but does not work in that case there is one too much 
forget provider file collection filecollection it was just a side thought my use case was actually what i exampled above having a directory property in my case i don t have a plugin creating that task it is just a task for this one project and created in the build script directly but only one instance will ever exist and the property does not need to be defined from outside it can simply be defined inside the task as shown so now i use but if you say it is a technical conceptual limitation just close this issue i just wondered that it doesn t work with a directory directly and that i either have to transform it to a file collection filecollection or wrap it in a provider 
bmuschko yeah sure
lacasseio sure here s a build scan https scans gradle com s qmaz kwi atsu qmaz5kwi3atsu i ran the tests on a different os than last time and now only the 83 name test fails i will look into making the other fail as well to reproduce the error i issued this from a command prompt 
yes thanks closing as duplicate 
thanks for the info will hv a try n report back based on testing the trouble is caused by one of our internal library published to our own repository it has nothing to do with maven cache the weird thing is that the library published by teamcity linux build agent is causing the trouble while the one built n uploaded on my mac is recognized without any issue will dig into more and report back will see the difference between these two outputs but the team city one used to work on wed mar 15 2017 at 1013 am benjamin muschko notifications github com wrote 
for my special case i have to work with an ide that inserts classpath entries from time to time and it uses relative paths for everything only for this particular project i also insert my gradle dependency classpath entries via file when merged whenmerged to achieve relative paths which works fine until i start the process again and it crashes due to the unreadable format yes i know this approach is not really how gradle is designed but i got this task so i work on it the basic bug or wrong behavior in my eyes is the fact that gradle respectivly the eclipse plugin crashes when reading and parsing a totally valid classpath file

sorry clarification it wasn t working in any version 
melix bmuschko what i want to do is to add the ability to resolve something from a external repository such as npm ruby or conan without touching the repository handler repositoryhandler part of gradle primary reason is that i have gone down that rabbit hole before of trying to add a custom repository type and one soon ends up in internal api hell if something does not look like maven or ivy effectively it cnnot be done using public a pis apis i know there will be work done to eventually provide some public ap is apis but they are not available yet there is also a fair use case to this for extracting files out of a local tar zip wihout manually unpacking it first with a copy task so my approach was to dirty and side step that by using a self resolving dependency selfresolvingdependency to do the work of getting the files somewhere on disk i know this is is not quite the intention of that specific interface but it is the simpest way of allowing a user to at least use the dependencies and configurations as they would usually it also hides the complexities of resolving the dependencies from them to a great extent the point that i am making with this issue is that there are a number of public ap is apis in the dependency hierarchy which should be usuable but there are assumptions in the internal of the gradle codebase about how they will being used which contradicts what is documented on the public api 
i made the title describe the symptom instead of suggesting the problem this time 
pitest features your added feature i don t know if the option mechanism support that update pitest features instead of pitest features as i hope to have that syntax supported one day without the need po put it right after the task 
sure if the target tests targettests parameter is not set by an user in the plugin configuration the value from target classes targetclasses is taken target classes targetclasses is always set by the plugin logic and is a sensible default value however an uses might want to narrow the scope of pit execution to subset of tests sample usage https github com szpak gradle pitest plugin blob a c e f dec ab a f src 32a8c68973702e1f16dec35ab634635735a374f0src main groovy info solidsoft gradle pitest pitest plugin pitestplugin groovy l l 121 l104l121 in code and the original issue https github com szpak gradle pitest plugin issues 143 which brought me here

bmuschko sorry for long reply weekend after all  here is sample project where this bug reproduces click https github com saksmt gradle publish issue 3003
as of now scripts that do the equivalent of readlink f to resolve actual path fail miserably i d expect the file type to be replicated properly if something is a symlink it should be reproduced as is imho 
i see that this task has some inputs so i thought missing the output and some other inputs was accidental https github com gradle gradle blob master subprojects plugins src main java org gradle api tasks upload java l 141 l141 if this was by design then we might need to accept it it would just be a bit nicer if this was fixed we added the output to the upload task a few years ago to make it up to date when nothing changes but over the years we have occasionally run into build failures where we would need to clean the entire output a pretty large directory to get past them i d like to get away from this practice and have traced the issue to this one there may be others that i m not aware of if this bug is fixed we won t have to trade correctness for performance and instead can have both 
sorry i was going to comment earlier cc carlonzo ideally this bug should be resolved in the same way that https github com gradle gradle issues 7950 was resolved the root cause why transformation hasn t been executed yet is shown to the user so the user has some idea where the error comes from with the current message transformation hasn t been executed yet and even with your revised wording above the user still has no idea what went wrong and it will require more back and forth triaging between gradle and the plugins to debug the issue that said i also understand that this stacktrace is different from the one in https github com gradle gradle issues 7950 and more debug info may not be available if you think this is the best debug info gradle can give to users then let s use that but if there is more info available please add it after all it s gradle and plugin authors who will receive these bug reports right 
thanks wolfs i m using this plugin https xmlbeans apache org 250 version i tried with the latest version but the same error appear let me prepare a simple project to reproduce the issue

hmm i m going to have to look further maybe something is cached somewhere locally i edited my source and it seems to be working on wercker now strange guess i ll chalk it up to me being an idiot or something weird in my local windows environment can t check that atm i did and stackoverflow 24 hours before that didn t find another way to publish to s 3 s3 than with maven publish seems that publish only runs if build has run and since this is a bom that i m building and the artifact type is pom this seemed the only way to get it to build something that could be published i could be wrong about this am a n b n00b when it comes to gradle though from what you ve said what i m trying to do is currently not possible with only 1 plugin mean it is if i craft the xml manually 
information added
confirmed generating module metadata with rc 1 61rc1 fixes the problem 
wolfs thanks for the fast response yes i used 44 yeah this is the same issue than gradle gradle native 281 i tried nightly 45201801022358560000 with which the problem is solved but i still have one remark because in my opinion these paths should not be included in the options txt files 
hi bmuschko thank you for the link i will evaluate it further anyway  it s a thirdparty it s a plugin and as a such it cannot be used e g in plugin management pluginmanagement dsl i would like to see gradle providing robust secrets management as first class citizen  there are imho two aspects which should get covered 1 consistent access to credentials be it even still unencrypted in gradle gradle properties 2 pluggable configurable storage and support for established solutions or do you find this to be a nonsense 
mac os macos high sierra 10132 c 88 17c88 on my mac as well as on teamcity build agents in docker linux i ve run both with parallel and not max parallel forks maxparallelforks 1 it does not affect the result however if i add configure on demand option the problem disappears 
os linux amd 64 amd64 gradle 33 jdk 17 first i depend on a aar through maven serverthen for test i depend on this aar local and it will still pull aar from server and it block more detail log creating

big guy all our modules are either java library kotlin or com android application library we re running gradlew okbuck yep happy to provide other info if needed
yupp that was our workaround no big deal a remaining issue though is that not following the redirect also breaks caching the wrapper zip gradle assumes the wrapper is downloaded already but fails to unzip this is because the body returned with the 302 is usually not a zip file would it be possible to at least not cache the response if it s not an http 200
it s reasonably intermittent the trigger seems to be making a change in one of the projects in an included composite build which triggers the issue maybe 75 of the time  the issue still occurs if i disable configure on demand i can t trigger it with 441 i can t trigger it if i disable parallel i ve possibly found something that might be causing it for our build server build we use an init script which explicitly calls https docs gradle org current javadoc org gradle start parameter startparameter html set task names settasknames to specify the build tasks this is so we keep our build server config as simple as possible start param startparam set task names settasknames build build server buildserver oddly when we set the tasks this way i can see some subsequent logging after the build successful message i ve attached two logs showing this one without the null pointer one with if remove the task setting from the build script and specify the same tasks on the command line i don t see the extra logging or null pointers with null pointer log https github com gradle gradle files with 1683387with null pointer log without null pointer log https github com gradle gradle files without 1683388without null pointer log 
in the build gradle we use this notation  configurations provided resolution strategy resolutionstrategy cache changing modules for cachechangingmodulesfor 0 seconds  only with this notation buildship refreshes the snapshot dependencies every time if this notation is missed but still included in the plugin then buildship does not refresh the snapshot dependencies every time only after the standard timeout which is far too long for us 
https github com wpilibsuite gradle jni i realized it was possible to just add arguments to the existing java compile command so i added that and an extension to native library spec nativelibraryspec to set it up properly that plugin is published to the plugin portal https plugins gradle org plugin edu wpi first gradle jni gradlejni and you are welcome to use it if you find any issues i ll happily try to fix them not it does require gradle 47
wolfs i see now what happened i ve read that paragraph several times and when i re read it the last time i just quickly scanned and my eyes glommed onto the first use of the term autocrlf which uses true in other words my mistake i just re read the git docs on this several times and i still don t quite understand how all this works git docs being what they are turns out that eol is overridden if you also use autocrlf so that s just noise so the issue is behind the keyboard as it so often is there s a related issue though setting core autocrlf false doesn t appear to stop me from committing new files with crlf line endings i can then clone that repo on win and nix and in each case the crlf file remains crlf should i just close this issue 
marcphilipp we re using this feature to store metadata from the build in the pom as such it s not consumed by downstream projects but it is very useful when a human comes along to look at a specific build 
hi ljacomet thank for fast reply in my case one dependency is skipped because we need always use that dependency s latest version and still want to use locking of dynamic dependencies feature to lock others that means we hope that home made dependency will never be locked and we know that dependency s latest is always safe the skipped dependencies skippeddependencies provided from nebula dependency lock is the right function matches our requirement https github com nebula plugins gradle dependency lock plugin wiki usage so i m looking for the similar thing in gradle s locking of dynamic dependencies  chunling
like i wrote in the original ticket running with scan produces the same error this is with debug stacktrace scan 
big guy oehme marcphilipp i updated the description with the link to the sample that demonstrates the issue is there anything else needed in addition to the sample and the build scans 
that worked thanks 
when i downgrade to gradle x 4x and leave the kotlin version the same everything works fine which leads me to believe it s a problem with gradle 5
see the context section above i ve made many tasks with list property listproperty regular file regularfile inputs i think it s more idiomatic than property file collection filecollection am i being a heretic of some sort some are even list property listproperty file system location filesystemlocation because that s exactly what they are 
in my case it s a common use case for task graph taskgraph before after task aftertask not if you are developing an independent plugin but if you are hooking into somebody else s work i ve encountered the need a couple of times instead of describing a use case i ll link you to it as soon as i commit but in a couple of days i m at the beach now

ljacomet increased readme in project to describe error messa
in order to prevent the unzipped folder being deleted we have tried to change the permissions of the file please note that builder is the user that runs the builds
i primarily use force when trying to apply constraints when i want that constraint to apply not only to declared dependencies but transitive ones as well the use case for this i run into the vast majority of the time is forcing use of a slightly newer version usually a micro version of a library in order to consume fixes for security vulnerabilities until such time as the direct dependencies update the versions they depend on any mechanism that allows me to declare i want any uses of this artifact direct or transitive to be constrained to this specific version would be sufficient for my purposes
blindpirate because the difference of two aab file is only the difference between gradle versions i guess it might be gradle s problem 
yes that s what we do 
not from my knowledge my module s configurations are relatively straight forward i am not too versed in gradle though i can t say for sure 
it contain source code of course it is normal at macos 1014 but it have some problems at macos 1015 i try clean cache of gradle uninstall and reinstall gradle by using brew remove the m 2 m2 repo but it still doesn t work correctly 
that works and at time of writing this issue i used that as a workaround i said that earlier then issue might be in java home resolution in either idea or gradle daemon launcher i did not gave different paths for daemon and client after all not sure yet which one is to blame does gradle daemon do some funky stuff to get it s java home i don t mean the one it has in env i mean the one it gives over ipc 
big guy ah i see what you mean i think i was just writing some bad gradle i had thought the include build includebuild directive in settings gradle was needed in order for the gradle build gradlebuild task to work consequently i also wasn t aware of gradle included build includedbuild thanks for clarifying indeed this worked 
this won t work i added it before posting my problem sorry should have stated that error is still up
actually i didn t do any changes we have an additional request on file opening that checks if configuration is up to date so i import project after this script configurations from import are saved than i open the script and receive the new configuration that differs from the one from import 
thank you for your fast answer error message looks like unfortunately for a other dependency  so it might help to write something like its not allowed to have a space as last character 
yes i know and i don t like the fact that we have to do this either the reason is that it is an apache wicket project where it is a standard practice to have all files of a component in one place example https github com apache wicket tree master wicket examples src main java org apache wicket examples datetime now if we don t add src main java to the resources the resources will not land in build resources and build libs component jar 
the os on the log in nodes of the hpc is cent os centos fwiw i do have the option of using a singularity image which is ubuntu 1804 but that manifested the same error will retrieve a screenshot shortly i implemented the g gradle user home method you mentioned earlier this week it did work mostly but it wasn t working perfectly inside the singularity image therefore myself and the main dev on gvgai gym decided to do the gradlew install method in that effort i removed the specifying gradle user home code that had been introduced if you want to see the actual pr of switching to the gradlew install method that would be found here https github com aadharna gvgai gym commit b e ab bca e bf cd 9564b96e6910ab7724738072451bca184e5bf9cd when i queried echo gradle user home it came up blank i removed the code which was passing in the g flag with the pr linked above edit add in ubuntu singularity image picture image https user images githubusercontent com ea 166607577500326435277680543511ea f edd af 95214f6319edd3af png 
perhaps the tools should only really handle the canonical first mount and the linux tools can do the others can you be more specific sent from my android phone with k 9 mail please excuse my brevity behlendorf reply reply github com wrote i spent a little time sorting out the new issues and there s good news and bad new the good news is that it was relatively straight forward to update the spl to build with 2639 this is now done merged in to mater and is working great the bad news is on the zfs side here the upstream developers re jiggered the get sb hook which is used to mount the filesystem it no longer passes is the vfsmount structure and that s a problem rudd o devsk i was hoping to explain the issue to you guys and get some feedback because the fix may impact the behavior of the zfs utilities so the problem is that under solaris a filesystem may only be mounted once at a single location in the namespace most of the mount options associated with the filesystem read only xattrs atime behavior are then tracked in this single location the zfs tools rely on this behavior to allow you to change the mount options using only the dataset name for example zfs set readonly on pool dataset unde r linux things are more complicated while every filesystem still may only have one super block it may be mounted multiple times in the namespace by various names with different mount options certain options which get set in the super block are global and apply to all the mounts while other are specific to the individual mount point for example you could have the dataset mounted in two places read only for one mount point and rw for the other up until now i resolved this complication by prohibiting multiple mounts of the same dataset i then linked the super block directly to the one and only vfsmount point this isn t really the linux way and i don t like doing it but it does resolve the complication of handling multiple mount points unfortunately the api change mentioned above just removed the mechanism i was using to do this so i think now is a good time to revisit this issue what do you guys feel is the right thing to do here should multiple mounts of the same dataset be allowed linux has no issue with this but it may not be easy possible to update the zfs tools to handle this or should i find some other way to lock it back down so you can t mount a dataset multiple times thoughts  reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github https github com behlendorf zfs issues 187 comment 1036633
i am emerge ing sys fs zfs rc r gentoo 060rc9r5gentoo from the tree and i see the above messages spl installed fine is he running a later version of the ebuild i am building against 344 which is fully built and has spl modules in lib modules 
that was the clean sources just git cloned i was running it as this pre configure prefix usr sysconfdir etc libexecdir usr lib with spl spl build make pre 
hmm setting zfs arc max to gb 3gb resulted in a massive performance decrease  but i ll watch it for a few days 
ya connfigure sysconfdir etc i found the init scripts only run from etc init d and not any other prefix
yes the extended offline test was completed without error took 6 hours i also wrote zeros to the entire disk re created the pool and the checksum errors occurred after copying just one 10 mb file after reboot the file could not be read input output error this issue is very reproducible currently the disk is formatted as ext 4 ext4 i copied couple hundred gb onto the disk and back no corruptions md 5 md5 checksums match thus i conclude that the hardware is ok and the problem is somehow zfs related but what

yes i can compile it just fine my problem is that it does not seem to generate the zfs kernel module for the record it does generate the other modules like zcommon ko or zunicode ko i m currently grepping around the source tree specifically the module directory but i haven t found anything of interest yet 
i didn t get a chance to do this last night i m dubious of i o throttling since it is a single gigabit limited client talking to a x 2 3x2 raid 10 raid10 on a quad core ht enabled xeon with gb 16gb ram also if i set sync disabled everything is fine i will get the above for you tonight as well as a comparison against omnios note the testbed will be a single rpm 7200rpm sata disk with the intel slog since my jbod is back in production 
hey i can only confirm that n worked when i added another raidz to the existing volume i do not use cache nor log devices 
yep i did 
noop the drop caches blocks 
just a zpool import gives the pool info as above zpool import f xenopool panics thereafter all commands hang the pool can t be imported it just panics every time requiring a reboot to run any other zfs commands sorry for the interleaved info i ll edit the post to make it clearer that s for linux oi was more complicated just a zpool import had a failed c assertion but i worked around that by symlinking the dev dsk c nd ns 0 cndns0 devices to a separate directory and doing a zpool import d this prints the pool info as expected then doing the zpool import d directory xenopool crashes the system i m not at all familiar with the tool chain so i don t know if the log is somehow obtainable 
no it s the same size 
behlendorf i was testing zfs on i scsi iscsi disk based on zfs with different parameters see 4211 i wanted to check if performance changes when using 4 kb blocksize for the i scsi iscsi disk as the harddisks on the storage server are kb 4kb advance format the standard linux i scsi iscsi target lio seems to have issues with setting the logical blocksize higher than 512 when the reported blocksize of the used disk zvol in my case is 512
after any reboot does not work 
so zfs mount is still happening before local fs target but the actual mounting isn t happening also the import 
by a i mean that right now check that will ensure that there is no children on the target fs will run only after actual receive is done and it s quite irritating to see error message about unexpected clone fs after receiveing tb 1tb stream so maybe it s better to set some kind of lock on the target fs so it will not possible to make clone of snapshot if parent fs is under receive 
issue https github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 1869
you re right it looks like a zfs sharenfs bug i just verified that it works fine if set sharenfs off and just put the filesystem in etc exports 
i m on the road and the system in question is in another city i will take a look in a day or two when i am with the machine again and try to get the log copied here 
well maybe but the fact is while device haven t been detected yet by kernel init script tries and fails to import rpool and only sleep helped why is that it is on usb yes it looks very similar to my case maybe it s even exactly what i have and we did the same dirty hack to fix this because i missed your zfs initrd post modprobe sleep  it s simple find rpool name in zdb output unfortunately it depends on zpool cache find its devices and wait with a s 10s timeout for example for them to appear in the system or even simpler just what rjvb proposed because there isn t much of a choices here cheap usb sticks suck from https github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs issues 108 i still think it s because of a timing zfs init scripts runs and fails before stick is found i can t explain it in any other way and sometimes it is imported before init scripts then all the three attempts fail a pool with that name is already created imported that s why i added this additional just in case condition to check if it s already imported and proceed normally 
nedbass of course here you are  yes i o operations on datasets have also worse performance 
both pools have an encrypted dataset below the root and showed the notice in the past 
yes i do i really want to understand what s going on here on a traditional fs i o error would assuming the transport was ok mean that the disk i o failed and there would be a message from the kernel in syslog complaining about the block it was trying to read but i don t see anything in syslog when i get the i o error from zfs 
none of the drives in this array were modified physically or otherwise intentionally through software prior to this problem i peformed a reboot to the system after operating for 152 days which included a kernel update zfs also needed to coddled a bit to get working again on the new kernel see https github com zfsonlinux zfs issues 3580 other changes include the addition of an h a h200a raid card which uses the same chipset as the onboard controller while in the bios configuration they seemed to talk to each other by updating an adapter list i don t know if this was responsible for the problem or not and i m not entirely prepared to bring this system down to try and reproduce the error the array in question which showed as corrupted is connected to the onboard chipset also of note is that i m now using a significantly different bios on the raid card which would not provide an exact duplication of the process any thoughts 
ryao thank you for the response here is the info you requested zo l zol version 063 linux distro cent os centos 63 linux kernel el x 8664 2632279el6x8664 i am willing to help with the patch i just need more insight on to what in send or recv may be the bottleneck i have done a lot of investigation on this and possible problems could be 1 zil 2 inflight io size
it succesfuly mounts 
i m pretty sure this came out of the recent changes in either zvol semantics ryao s elimination of an io layer or the accounting code dont have a specific commit as i only noticed it this morning on the rd 3rd stack containing zvol accounting fixup

tuxoko actually it is talking about this issue your backend filesystem appears to not support attrs large enough to handle the configured max rados name size this is documented here http docs ceph com docs jewel rados configuration filesystem recommendations not recommended actually this could be also read as xattr naming is too long i m actually unsure but running ceph in the latest version on zfs is currently a bit tricky and not fully supported as this document states this may result in difficult to diagnose errors if you try to use rgw or other librados clients that do not properly handle or politely surface any resulting enametoolong errors actually i didn t want to go back to filesystems like xfs because of this issue

hello thank you for fast reply no i use official zfs native ppa for several years and all ok except kernel 44049  cat etc apt sources list d zfs native stable trusty list deb http ppa launchpad net zfs native stable ubuntu trusty main  deb src http ppa launchpad net zfs native stable ubuntu trusty main sorry i can t use unstable version because it s working server with several vm s 
the pool was created some years ago and had been used since then i periodically updated to the latest stable kernel and git master branch of zfs spl at least it could be imported by kernel 4815 and zfs c ae a d f eca fcaad f c4434877ae449a637d0f302eca80fcaad354874f i m going back to this version for the time being 
the question i asked was in regard to the lead developer of this project making a patch for himself to use on a catch 22 catch22 in feature flags and therefore not addressed to you nor is it addressed to anyone else that is using a current version of this software since the relevant patch is over three years old and now deprecated what makes you think i m agreeing with anything you typed don t thank me i m not thank you for nothing i d file a bug report about people with pedophile ish usernames with such high exposure in a project that canonical seems to care so much about but your form is predictably excessive no thanks for those who might find this on google don t bother with that patch commit if your pool got userobj accounting enabled it is now a linux only pool you ll have to destroy it since per the broken explanation in the manpage once active it cannot be decactivated sort of like that doomsday machine that slim pickens was after 
the values i am showing here are all kernel 419 i have a few numbers for kernel 50 which basically confirm the numbers from kernel 419 no significant difference by kernel version but the zfs version makes a big difference write iops is down to 70 with zfs 08 average write iops 249 with zfs version 0713 and 175 with version 08

mabod your question made me try all the services again and now it works  my issue is now resolved i do wonder though shouldn t the packages re enable these services automatically for the user is not doing that an active choice 
i do have another zpool called storage which is a mirrored vdev but i m not using that zpool to create this zfs volume regarding dbgmsg that file is empty 
gmelikov bunder 2015 bunder2015 thanks for the tips unfortunately i m no good at compiling zfs from scratch especially on pve kernel fabian gruenbichler whoa this is great sure i could do a test on the pve kernel are you fabian from proxmox staff if you are then i could leave a message on proxmox forum 
zap c fzap 766fzap checksize error 22 occurs 8 times in dbgmsg while dnode c dnode 1231dnode hold impl error occurs 22occurs only once this makes me believe that dnode hold impl is the culprit here s some more output from dbgmsg  i have been using subversion instead of git so far so i have to install git and read git in a nutshell first before i can do git bisect i will do that during the weekend and post reults here maybe i should find out how to debug a kernel module as well peter
absolutely if you pass a list of commands you want the output for i will put it here after sanitizing any personal information for now what i observed is  of coruse nfs and other services won t be happy i also detected that the pools are no longer imported at boot except for rpool i can understand your point about not providing specific fixes in the howto but this is something that happened quite often with earlier revisions and some of us still use that system you owe nobody nothing though it is just nice to have and i might provide a simple script to run on the recovery cd if time permits i just think you might be more inclined to do so than me right now how would you prevent future problems from this what settings should be applied to the dataset during recovery and mods to etc fstab thank you 
the order of options made no difference but the live cd allowed me to crate the pool successfully i then export the pool and booted into my own environment trying to import results in store unavail insufficient replicas raidz 10 raidz10 unavail insufficient replicas sda unavail corrupted data sdc unavail corrupted data sde unavail corrupted data raidz 11 raidz11 unavail insufficient replicas sdb unavail corrupted data sdd unavail corrupted data sdf unavail corrupted data this is very odd the live cd livecd booted up with the software raid that have the system files too and i actually mounted those filesystems just to test before i created the zfs pool so any idea this may happen the udevadm versions are identical at 220 it seems that the only difference is that the system without live cd livecd has the root on a software raid

the snapshot rotation is failing again triggering cron emails  trace txt trace3txt https github com zfsonlinux zfs files trace txt 3211538trace3txt in this particular case i should add that there s an rsync job running which is copying something onto the zfs filesystem i m probably getting these additional errors because of that at the very least i assume the dataset is busy error trying to rotate the snapshots on the other hand i don t think an rsync job should trigger such errors 
a tunable where the default behavior is to disallow unencrypted children of encrypted datasets would provide most of the safety to average users it s just a matter of complexity which i don t have an opinion on

if you have a long running server with regular reboot intervals and loose your l arc l2arc you encounter performance issues over time this is caused by the missing trim for the cache devices from wikipedia  therefore in this case a trim of the l arc l2arc does increase l arc l2arc performance which is a good thing

wow nice support there brother i think purge could be a jquery function i m using it within fc to remove events from the calendar without refreshing if it s not an fc function then that would explain why it s not doing what i need should i be using event destroy eventdestroy function instead 
sorry i don t really know all these advance dev stuff i just old code php you can see what i mean at https gridplay net calendar at the bottom of the calendar the iframe tag should be in colour using highlight js but calendar is somehow preventing highlight to work 
i am using phillip frenzel s module for yii framework so perhaps the problem is there i know there is a lang directory on the bower install and it has many languages but en us isn t one of them the yii module uses en us as a language by default and it looks for it in that directory 
nope i already have slot event o verlap sloteventoverlap false i just want to be able to set the width of events or event sources eventsources and have the overlapping events adjust their left according to the width of the first event in the picture the event am 8am am 830am is still displayed with left 50 despite the overlapping event is not using 50 of the width 
hi sorry for this the select event is fired after a long press and i was not aware about this v 27 v27 is awesome
hi my actual problem is with datepicker inside custom agenda all agendaall view i want to load agenda all agendaall events only within the range selected i tried different possibilites like add event source addeventsource remove event source removeeventsource remove event sources removeeventsources rerenderevent etc in best case i am able to load same in all views including agenda all agendaall i want agenda all agendaall to be independent view which contains list of events 
fullcalendar container got height calc vh 100vh px 64px so it s not affected by the navbar or others elements in the page as i said it s perfectly fine in the browser itself but if you have a pwa ie a manifest json with display fullscreen the computed height on fc scroller has an extra px 20px even if resize is trigger and there is no way to create a pwa test case in jsbin like site the issue appeared since chrome 56 and fullcalendar 32 but i didn t see any changes related to this thing before that everything was ok i will update if i find something 
on the fr js file there is no translation for month names day names perhaps they are translated by moment js in the locale file all js i see translation for months days  sorry if i m wrong francois
arshaw sorry this is the runnable http jsbin com vapezer edit js output my question is if i change do timeline day timelineday it works but with agenda day agendaday not there is any way of this feature run with agenda day agendaday display view displayview something like templateipi https cloud githubusercontent com assets f e c e 3345204211962471983f6e4c21e e abe 11e68abe f df jpg 3f4839378df4jpg thanks
https codesandbox io s p k q 40 0p78k93q40 in this demo i m trying to set id after dragging an external event to the calendar same problem
we are trying to implement the functionality here https www youtube com watch v jt w lf sd y jtw6lf0sd1y
arshaw yes i believe that s the crux of the issue fullcalendar begins to immediately render dynamic options are set which triggers a re render re fetch of events and a race condition or something i initially solved by wrapping my dynamic options in a set timeout settimeout which was janky then did a bit of refactoring to pass them in the initial initialization 
arshaw i want to use day render dayrender callback when the all day slot alldayslot false for the agenda week agendaweek view is that possible 
the problem is because the date is shown in gmt 5 hours for the central time zone when i bound it to a date control using aurelia the data control didn t take that into account i m sure there is a better way to handle it but i ended up adding 5 hours to the date and it works sometimes you have to just hold your nose and do what works to keep moving along thanks 
arshaw the issue was caused from our side due to setting max width from an outer dom object i m closing this issue thanks 
hi thanks working good can u make it to do like instant touch and dragging here my requirement is instant touch and dragging things here people no one knows touch for few seconds and then drag thats my problem 
well i changed to the jquery native fullcalendar and it works fine seems the problem is that ng fullcalendar event render eventrender is returning a jquery element that isnt recognized on the el popover function

ah did not get notice of the reproducing question sorry about that the codepen that gmw web has created is my exact issue as well thanks for creating it 
yeah i know the demonstration is missing in my report but it s very hard to put a v tiger vtiger crm inside a code pen codepen and i don t know how v tiger vtiger sets up fullcalendar and whether the bug could be related to how the library is used in that project or if the bug is indipendent to its usage i reported the issue anyway because someone could find this correction obvious also without demonstration it seems to me that the intent of the routine is to avoid bounding rect computation when the scrollable is some kind of root element of the page so adding html in addition to document may seem logical
hi acerix the calendar is part of a large out systems outsystems application stripping it to the core and still keeping a working page is not doable but i have saved the page as a stand alone set attached which is showing what goes wrong if you activate planboard html goes to the day view and drag it a little down you will see the now indicator nowindicator stops somewhat half way planboard zip https github com fullcalendar fullcalendar files planboard 2306249planboard zip

https codepen io anon pen g bj ra r gbjrar editors 1111 so event receive eventreceive and event leave eventleave fires while drop does not so i dont have the information where i dropped the event i was dragging therefore i cannot replace his date and time in the database this is when you drag events from one calendar to another doesnt matter weather its weekly day or month view also external elements which is not included in demo works and if you drag n drop external button or some other element and drop it into calendar drop event fires and i have info logged into console only drop includes date of where the event was dropped and i m not having it fired acerix

i d like to render a single day with many multiple slots event constraints example suggests there s only one start end time essentially render 912 slots with 30 min open slot that a user could schedule an event in followed by 15 min break where user can t add or schedule a new event example 915945 user can book that slot 9451000 break period rendered as background not editable 1030 1100 user can book 1100 1115 break period so on that s the pattern

sorry not sure what s happening with my bundle it doesn t seem to exist in the source must be an old version
hmm strangely enough on a small test script it does work i ll investigate further 
perhaps i m mistaking the purpose of the watch flag that being said passing cw doesn t do what i would expect which is to recompile and restart the server 
yes i understood another question what s the exactly workflow do you recommend for developing applications using coffe script coffescript i mean interacting with dom use native java script javascript libraries or not that kind of thing what s your perspective on this 
that is nice too it is not exactly what i had in mind because it does not operate in a single assignment expression and because it would be difficult to work into the formal parameters 
ambiguity 
i ve put a properly formatted version in this gist http gist github com 458007 sorry about the confusion

sure starting to realize it might be a little more complicated than i initially thought because you ll need access to this and arguments from the enclosing function but we ll see here is an example for an unbound function which uses a self variable and an args variable  i think this would be useful for a few cases so let me know if you think it is worth the cost of those two extra variables or if you have a better way of doing this 
i mean that with an empty code when code block code break code must be substituted automatically i know about it pre switch settings when 1 2 do some dosome pre i just think is wrong when pre switch settings when 1 then  nothing when 2 do some dosome pre equals pre switch settings when 1 2 do some dosome pre and not necessarily duplicate code break code in js output when the coffee is as follows pre switch settings when 1 then break when 2 do some dosome pre it compiles to pre switch settings  case 1 break break case 2 do some dosome  pre 
tesco good that it is one liner and doesn t really force me to maintain small fork of coffescript however adding the new method only to coffescript classes as part of the code generation would allow the language to keep clean and conscious library framework developers would be able to use it as well while still keeping the built in prototypes unscathed for more pythonic ways using invocation like horse or person 23 if would be possible to have the actual functions defining the classes as an alternate name and implement the simple constructor function with the name of the class for instance horse class horseclass would be the function such that new horse class horseclass works old fashioned way and horse is the function the delegates the arguments to new horse class horseclass more explicitly function horse weight  return new horse class horseclass weight 
great suggestions reminds me a bit of how some scala s functions can be done replacing curly braces with parenthesis guess i ve just feel in love with coffeescript a bit more 
jashkenas why should it break instanceof isntanceof only tests whether a prototype of an object is in the prototype chain starting from the constructor function constructorfunction prototype thus btw if constructor function constructorfunction prototype is not an object instanceof will fail http bit ly ueib 7 9ueib7 regarding inheritance a real prototype of an object i e internal prototype property is set once at creation and further cannot be changed except implementation extensions such as proto i e ctor function may be normally reused in respect of setting its prototype property because child prototype will be set always correctly as pre child prototype new ctor  the same as child prototype proto ctor prototype pre and when ctor prototype will be changed child prototype proto will still refer to old value since assignment in js is made not by reference but by sharing by pointer i e further assignment to ctor prototype will change only this name binding to a new object and it s may be reused again to generate a new prototype what michaelficarra mentioned is a normal technique in js see also this section http bit ly b zs c b11zsc there at the end this optimization is also mentioned also as i mentioned i d consider further optimization with native object create which does the same but is obviously faster p s you may leave it as is thought i don t see a reason why this optimization shouldn t be accepted i think it s used in any framework which provides such a sugar for chaining prototypes dmitry 
my reason isn t to copy perl or c  i only brought them up as a side benefit of consistency with other languages that implement this operator my reason is entirely for readability the ternary operator foo bar baz is extremely common thus my guess is that foo bar in coffee script coffeescript will trip up a lot of folks who are new to coffee script coffeescript if you re used to the ternary operator from nearly every other language it almost seems like foo bar is syntactic sugar for foo bar foo which is actually the exact opposite of what it intends to be in coffee script coffeescript i realize this will be a breaking change and that s unfortunate  i m hoping though that it would be reasonable to change this while coffee script coffeescript is still relatively young thanks again for your consideration 
tharabas yes that s a great idea too so any s 1s i could start working on the patch if the maintainers wouldn t be against the idea 
stdbrouw my use cases fall within the realm of templating but cover more than just mustache style templating since the interpolation is coffeescript code and i get the return value i could easily extend it to do more advanced things my particular idea was having a templating system with plugins that had full access to the template variables in addition to just helpers michaelficarra mine still has the whitespace intact also it looks better with better coffee script coffeescript syntax highlighters than it does here with vim coffee script the interpolated code is highlighted also my example doesn t have multiple adjacent lines without interpolation which would make the difference between an array literal and a string literal more pronounced finally the commas make it a bit less pleasant to read 
jashkenas ha didn t even see that it wouldn t hurt to reiterate this special case under the classes inheritance and super section also code examples would help greatly 
i had a feeling that was too trivial of a problem to not have been addressed already whoops 
never mind this seems to be intended behavior didn t test it with multiple values i m an idiot 
i d expect it to be the second but yeah i can see why i would end up with the first one but either ways why does the code not compile 
to be honest i do not think so fs js has some dependencies i e util js path js and event js the variables exports and process are included in these files e g in events js var is array isarray array is array isarray var domain function event emitter eventemitter  if exports using domains usingdomains  if there is an active domain then attach to it domain domain require domain if domain active this instanceof domain domain  this domain domain active   exports event emitter eventemitter event emitter eventemitter i never declare the variable exports in my code 
error of mine i paste the wrong app coffee thinking it was a global bug i had something like this in an other app coffee file  which now compiles to app use express session instead of app use express session  so you re right it s a duplicate of 2715
adamdanielsdesign that s another workaround but as the body of a function cannot both occur to the right hand side of the arrow and as an indented block why does my original code fail to compile 
i can replicate it in any file under the above conditions added grunt contrib watch version too in case it helps 
it is going to take some years to be outdated so i don t think it s meaningless and neither does the v 8 v8 and node js team because it is the only way to test forward the advance in java script javascript after all after the es 6 es6 spec is finished there will be also es 7 es7 and es http es8http www ality 2ality com es html 201109es68html 
ahh super without parentheses i was not aware of this usage thank you 
just translate 1 then proceed as usual it should be easy to recognize 1 there is no variable name to guess 
i hope you are not trying to be funny that we would be pretty sad it is still a question please give me your best answer void is used in many great languages and i am pretty sure i am not the only one who likes it more than undefined if void freakes you out so much please let us at least know why 
the examples list on coffeescript org that section currently just has options for using the coffee script coffeescript shell in a terminal and cosh is a webapp but yeah adding a link and description at the bottom of that section would be great if that s what you re thinking really it s just that i don t want to start telling people that it s the best app to use for exploring coffee script coffeescript if i made it and am the only guy who thinks that if it had a little prop on the site that d make it feel kind of accepted by the community and obviously helps with getting new users thanks for considering it by the way 
ahh didn t realise that i realize that i write a lot of ruby and coffee script coffeescript i personally prefer the to push maybe that is just personal preference but i see it a lot in other rubyists code so i don t think i am alone i realize cs is not ruby there are many things i like better about cs over ruby that doesn t mean cs can t borrow features from other languages like ruby if the cost is cheap i didn t realize the cost here if it was cheap then why not apparently it is not cheap though 
michaelficarra that sound problematic a given script could either loop through generators or arrays node 011 and iojs also support for of i d much rather have a special syntax like for gen x of my gen mygen 
it s more a suggestion to add to the compiler if you want sorry i ve never submitted an issue before so it seemed like the right place to donate the snippet for the common problem myself and a couple others have had is there a better place for this 
vendethiel no differences between both generated codes except for the obvious  that also leads me to think that it s related to the compiler registration code somehow lydell i might try that but i don t have handy the environment to build different compiler versions and try it
the proposal is based on idea that every functional method can be build over for in  for of my arguments 1 we have similar syntax for map filter for each foreach and can make same for unzip scala example below 2 this behavior is obvious 3 objects have method keys but still dont have values object values https developer mozilla org en us docs web java script javascript reference global objects object values 4 mixins are bad scala 
just started with styled components first place i ve ever seen this syntax aside from the above link it is really hard to find any documentation of it 
geoffrey booth geoffreybooth i think babel transpiling only makes things worse i just tried transpile presets babel env on the simple example and got evalmachine anonymous 5 was 3 without transpile expected behavior is 1 babel has a mode where it tries to preserve line numbers which would probably bump it back to 3
flow include comments are kind of a parser hack when the flow parser sees them it just throws out the comment start end tokens so for this code 
we use a dependency injection system which parses the output of the constructor to know what modules to inject a bit like angularjs did this can t find a module with a 1 at the end 
i think you just cleared up all my confusion and i think i can keep the pr small i should have something in an hour or so fingers crossed 
geoffrey booth geoffreybooth for the visual separation of code blocks thanks for the answers everyone 
the problem is still there thanks too i ve already moved the issue to hiredis

yes i was running redis sentinel against redis 24 i ve killed the master i did it twice and was able to reproduce the issue both times is it a known issue where is it supposed to be fixed on 24 branch or on the unstable branch thanks
after deleting local dump and re slaving it worked so i guess it s the corruption what should i do now with this ticket i can t reliably reproduce the problem 
i use zend framework so i need this version is here anyway to solve the problem 
the install guide says to run the binary from the source directory the binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory run redis with  src redis server i know i can run make install the point of this issue is to make it clear and consistent and for most other software i thought it was obvious i was referring to software with source code 
that s all what i ve found in logs
i try redis server test memory and this test passed 
done found another typo on config page fixed that and put both into a pull request 
i m using through ssh is it matter i will test 287 after one minute 
makes sense could still use an update for clarity 
yum install redis redis el x 8664 28142el7x8664 from epel repository
the issue was caused by a leading whitespace on one sentinels announced ip like  44444444 my bad 
i use 305 version the last and repl ping slave period is 10
i m running several instances of redis with a default config and specify different socket files per each instance as a command line parameters to redis server  i however need to precreate the socket directory var run redis after every reboot of the server it would be nice to add a functionality that checks if socket s directory exists and creates it if it doesn t before creating the socket 
i don t think setting node timeout big enough is a good idea the node timeout sometimes keep the cluster healthy for example when there is a connection issue even if the node is alive node timeout used to reconnect to the node and users also need the node pfail and fail state but just want user themselves or their own tools decide whether to failover or not at this time disable auto failover maybe needed 
i am using redis for high availability so i have a master and slave and i have many writes and reads going on it so performance is also key thing for me so do you think still i require just redis server redis cli redis benchmark redis conf and sentinel conf files 
badboy that sounds better to me than the options i proposed when i was looking for a way to do this i recall being surprised that raw still printed elapsed time when blocking better not to pollute with more arguments too along with that would it be good to always print elasped time unless raw is specified i think having a more consistent output would be desirable

redis benchmark does not support redis cluster i tested with my own code which is based on hiredis asynchronous socket the code reads the slot configuration by command cluster slots and dispatches keys to shards accordingly i could not find many engineers talking about redis cluster performance scalablility everywhere that is the may reason why i posted this as a issue i d really appreciate if somebody who has did this test before can shed some light 
even though i adjust maxmerory to a lower it would give no guarantee by the way i was not looking at used memory value and cannot proof fragmentation version do you have any kind of algorithm to increase eviction rate if memory keeps growing up if not you can consider implementing it 
let me first try to understand the statement that let s see real example 1270016379 hmset myhash a alfa b beta ok 1270016379 hgetall myhash 1 a 2 alfa 3 b 4 beta 1270016379 hset myhash a alfa integer 0 1270016379 hgetall myhash 1 a 2 alfa 3 b 4 beta when i hgetall myhash the first time and the next time i get in both cases the same result when i perform an operation hset myhash a alfa and the result stays the same as before i would say the value did not change but you say redis considers it a change anyway how it comes does it mean that whenever a hset operation is performed redis considers it a change of related key regardless of real effect on the hash value 
sure  redis call set time dummy redis call expire time 100 local result redis call keys if result then return result end return empty  the value time is replaced by the current time before the script is sent to redis example t z 20171231t083703125z

i am using redis 505 wh should be used to remove the unwanted keys from the node that shouldn t have them in memory 
how do i find that out if it helps i m using debian lenny python packages which reports python 252 r 25260911 r25260911 jan 4 2009 215932
yeah i guess i was rambling a bit in this one 
thank for answer different code base and dependencies different servers first worker is for media encoding purposes and should work on dedicated powerful server 
that was a task set result tasksetresult with 2 failed eager result eagerresult s inside the backend shoulnd t matter in this case it s mysql database 
sure ionut turturica jonozzz at yahoo com this might be only a small step towards a better logging system in the future i d like to see a flexible way to configure logging levels handlers streams rotation etc 
and you are correct i noticed that issue in the unstable branch and i decided to stick with the latest stable one but somehow i messed up the directories and i was still running the 111 out of curiosity did you fix this already 
i haven t thought too deepely some ideas 1 don t do it at the amqp layer do it above so that celeryd just puts back a message whose version it cant handle 2 make amqp calls directly like chan queue declare queue celery s  version  i m not an amqp expert so maybe this should be done with exchanges and routing keys 3 make the user pre create the queues more generally my problem is that when i have a version mismatch the old messages seem to cause exceptions in celery then it holds on to them so the queue stop processing new messages instead of versioning maybe my issue would be solved if celery somehow stashed unprocessable messages on another queue so we could debug them 
i can tell you but the odd thing is this code path was executed at least once before without throwing an exception  having said that take a look at http github com rackspace python cloudfiles tree the code had called container get objects which returned a list previousobject was set to some member of the list i e 
it s hard to say on the celeryev side you can see only incrementing events counter task list is same as usual but rabbitmq log contains many open close connection entries at this time it seems that some processes are stalled in some loop this issue may be releated to restarting celery process via supervisorctl restart command 
maybe it is possible throw worker lost error workerlosterror if worker exitcode 0 it case of using kill i e hard timeout 
so the quickest way to see what i mean is to look at get config in app base py round line 242 we re building the configuration view configurationview  someone more familiar with the django settings stuff might have a better idea though 
i run this code in 5 minutes memory starts growing to gb 1gb and doesn t stop 
hello apologies this bug is invalid it was because one of the worker nodes had an older version of the code

hmz good catch it was meant to run every fork but it doesn t in my current patch what location do you suggest to put this logging initialisation code in i put it at that location as i thought djcelery loaders on worker init is also runs every fork i found that djcelery loaders on worker init also does not run every fork is that intended i thought those calls to close database are also required every fork no on tue oct 11 2011 at 157 pm ask solem hoel reply reply github com wrote

same error but worker still accepts and executes tasks is there anything i can debug from the redis side 
this was the result i got for print result r  result  i am interested in contributing a fix if someone can help me understand the issue 
that s a great idea i never though of that i ll try that out and post back here thanks 
ask i should give your more details python 273 celery 3021 server ubuntu 1204 lts we have more than 10 servers and each is running around 20 celery workers we didn t directly start our celery work from celeryd instead our worker class wraps the celery worker object see below 
no but we have celery deployed on 1016 instances at the moment and it will happen to 1 or 2 of them every h 24h i am trying to identify which task might be related i am not sure how to debug it but if you have anything let me know logging is on warning right now and it is all we see 
yes i ve made upgrade seems like all this troubles goes away thank you 
yes log taken just now on the server of my previous post so same configurations described before i was expecting just for reserved task but i have 11 let me know if you need further logging 
of course here are the details if you need more information let me know celery report  rabbit mq rabbitmq 313 result backend rpc only one registered task btw there is only one process consuming the whole cpu maybe it s the celery management process

yes sure  note also the worker name worker 913451 as you can see the master process try to recreate the worker process forever but without success the session identifier on oracle side remain the same process id 11865 session id 684 serial number 7122 any help is apreciated bye
i think there are just hidden exceptions within my groups and chord subtasks this means that i never get stuff written to the database i am running with debug on yes i ll close this because i ll just wrap everything in a try  except and log the errors to a file 
our provider had a couple of hardware issues with their routers recently causing dropped packets there had also been a few instances of their routers resetting after scheduled maintenance i have not been able to test if manually disabling the interface over which rabbit mq rabbitmq connections is made will also have the same effect i will try to find an isolated node in our cluster and test this

we are using the master branch commit d e f b c f bc b ed 1 462d4e57f3825b2c9180f24660bc87115b658ed1 so the patch is already on our production switching to utc doesn t hurt us but a warning troubleshoot faq would be neat for such cases 
debug false template debug false no i don t enable it in production do you have any way to check it out i will debug base on it

i ve created virtual environment and installed the reqs 
yes sorry about that thought i had created it it s there now 
the version i used is celery 44 python 38 i checked the source code and found no code to handle self default now  self last run at 
that sounds interesting any recommendations i was also thinking we might want to support every backend as a schedule backend e g db redis elastic search elasticsearch couch db couchdb etc but we could start with a native python object db 
the error is thrown on the instantiation of the celery object you can use the below code to reproduce 
sorry i didn t realize i created the request the issue i had was with a dependency issue between celery and kumbo and it was not finding a dependency combination for celery redis 
georgepsarakis precisely 
sure thanks for the response i will upgrade celery to the latest release and will report back 
sorry for the noise but i m not able to check further now and don t want to forget my best guess is that if anything changed it would be due to 4746 i ll try to repro when i can and check against master 
this is librabbitmq specific as the original post says and it says why too

matt black 85 mattblack85 for the tests above i m running just 1 worker started by running  which yields a concurrency of 4 prefork 
auvipy i will add some clarifications to the redis max connections setting which will partially solve the issue above the comprehensive solution would test how redis max connections behaves with the broker pool limit and report that in the docs e g not specifying any setting effectively sets redis max connections to the broker pool limit default of 10 connections or setting the redis max connections sets the broker pool limit and also what happens when both are passed finally it makes sense to have a bool setting redis blocking pool which defaults to false and instantiates a redis connection blocking connection pool blockingconnectionpool in case of true for all those use cases where the redis connections are limited but you want ot avoid exceptions e g pricing plans that price redis by number of connections 
i wrote it above celery 421
i m terribly sorry the test case i wrote above is completely wrong i was trying to replicate the production environment tested the wrong thing and failed to even describe the problem correctly the issue is in fact related to mysql errors while revoking tasks and is very similar to an issue i reported as celery django celery results 88 while that bug was fixed at the time i reported it this bug is still present in rc 2 440rc2 if you wish i can close this bug and open a new one maybe in that other project but for now i will describe it here while the celery worker is running and while using mysql as a results backend perform these steps 1 shut down mysql simulating a connection issue 2 attempt to run a task and revoke it as many times as there are workers  p details   result if you then restart mysql it will have no effect as all the workers have already crashed the main process will keep running and print received task messages but no task will run the example i posted at the top isn t really an issue as i unfortunately neglected to mention the real test after restarting mysql i can keep running tasks and celery doesn t complain it reconnects to mysql but when the connection is lost and an attempt to revoke a task is made that s when the worker crashes and the process keeps going as if nothing bad happens 
unfortunately it does not work for rc 1 43rc1 release too
sorry for the delay yes it does looks like the broker removes the first task from the queue even if there is countdown and holds it somewhere else until the right time 
well i passed explicitly kwarg s default value and that helped because i don t want to patch celery 
do you mean a fix for this issue

hi maybe i wasn t clear sorry couch rest couchrest uses rails 3 callbacks http github com mattetti couchrest blob master lib couchrest mixins callbacks rb i m using rails 23 with couch rest couchrest and devise my code fails on before create method which is calling inside models confirmable mixin couch rest couchrest uses rails 3 callback such as create callback before instead but i did a hack using own mixin which makes a bridge between those callbacks without broken devise or couch rest couchrest code

i ll buy that without diving into the code would it make sense to add an after delete hook to the user model that does that automatically 
seems like a nice customizable solution 
i simply deleted myself from sql and i see welcome dmitry but i m not dmitry and i don t know his password 
unfortunately that doesn t work because find by path doesn t understand optional segments either find by path unconditionally checks one specific segment looking for the scope  where segment position is derived from counting the number of slashes in a normalized version of the path prefix 
i will
oki http github com r stankov rstankov devise here i have made the fix i hope it s good enough have also send pull request if it is easer to apply the patch have a nice day and x 10x for the great gem 
josevalim thanks a lot for the prompt reply it s just plain sign in sign out the code i put in my application controller applicationcontroller is and tail the log and do the sign in sign out in the browser that s the way i reproduce the bug
for example when i use google apps strategy i get following differences in callback urls omniauth 016 users auth google apps callback openid ns omniauth master users auth google apps callback method post openid ns so rails tries to find route users auth google apps callback with method post but devise for generates only with method get 
sorry but i don t know how to write a failing test case can i send you a smaller rails 3 rails3 application 
yes i could do that can describe it in w iki wiki if you want but have one more question at the moment i have following code config warden do manager manager default strategies scope user unshift custom authentication end custom authentification makes http requests at the moment on each login custom authentification http requests are made can i somehow make this requests only if default authentication doesn t work 
that was the problem i added it and now it is working again thank you very much

hi sorry for the delay i m have a deadline coming up so i don t have much time i will try to reproduce the error this weekend devise version is 112 rails version is 301 mysql 2 mysql2 version is 024

yes it was bcrypt and yes i am on windows xp thanks let me try the devkit i did not see that in the documentation thank you 
by being in place i meant having authenticate user in the before filter the expected workflow is pre 1 user logs in at http path com users sign in with valid credentials 2 after sign in they are redirected to http foo path com subdomain added to route by the after sign in hook 3 user signs out and is redirected back to http path com users sign in subdomain stripped by after sign out pre this workflow works redirected to subdomain upon login without authenticate user in the before filter and is broken the user is not redirected to their subdomain with the authenticate user in the before filter as far as i can tell by the ghetto console logging from within the after sign in hook the after sign in path for is not called at all with authenticate user in the before filter thanks again 
i have a social network site on the root page is a register link when a user signs in he has altough access to the root page where he can read news etc with the mentioned register link but when he clicks again the register link he becomes redirected to another site without any hints why the redirect happened

hi what do you mean by in a smaller application i actually did test it on a simple application created using just rails and then devise without other classes this m user example is indeed as small as it gets to illustrate the problem as for reproducing the bug without devise hmm i do know that once i comment out devise for users in routes db at least rails server and rails c would start without problem of course i don t get the default routes what i can do next is to manually code in the route mappings while leaving devise for users commented out to see whether this problem would still occur will update later thanks 
okay finally got around doing it 
i agree that having callbacks for all possible methods would be a pain however it would be nice to have some official public api for developers currently we can always hack and overwrite devise methods but there is a problem that something can be broken in future releases so we must maintain our code with devise changes more carefully 
sorry turns out this was coming from a conflict with my neglected fork of has many polymorphs i stripped that out and everything started working again 
it works fine with rails 303 devise 117 devise117
will try to do it in the weekend one more thing that need to be done if the email used to recover password is valid or invalid the url redirect should be the same 
just sent a pull req thanks for your quick answer https github com plataformatec devise pull 981
sure this is the basic recipe for most of the tests involved  i will add that the app itself runs fine just tests fail also running the following rails 307 datamapper 110 devise 131 cacan 164
my devise version 142 and config scoped views true 
ok
after much thought i ve concluded that there isn t a use case that isn t covered by devise as is it s a matter of devise not duplicating warden s interface 11 and on the surface of it it seemed like there is no reason to leave it out but it isn t a necessity in of itself as far as the suggestion on making it a constraint i had derived that from reading the current devise routing helpers specifically how devise sets the scope for the controllers and then always returns true i had assumed probably incorrectly that this is an appropriate way to do this anyway thanks for taking a look 
but even if it makes sense to raise an exception on create i don t understand why devise does not show me an error message in my form as it used to do instead of raising me a raw error 
thanks jose i am working on a pull request now 
rails 307 ruby 191 devise 134 it s strange and bad but i cannot reproduce that error in example app 
thanks
oh my fault i mean this method active for authentication 
can you give me an example i add this to model devise database authenticatable registerable recoverable rememberable trackable validatable and i give error undefined method encrypted password for user x d 168 0x0000000895d168
reinstalled the gem wonder now it doesn t occurs
yea i will get like email sending from reply to email and message to be send to mail everything it will show as it seems i will get mail but actually i dont get at all 
not so easy i suppose it s related at the ruby version because with ruby 192 works fine i just deployed my app on this vps with 187 and i m not able to render the views in my app could you suggest any workaround to reproduce it you need the same version of ruby and devise 204 thank you for your time
even better a pull request with tests and a fix https github com plataformatec devise pull 1832

sorry resource isn t nil it s just a new object instance we aren t subclassing or otherwise modifying sessions controller sessionscontroller i m guessing that it s being lost because of the redirect

greetings jos i ve attached a very simple rails devise app demonstrating my problem in my app and this example the user requires four parameters for authentication org id term id id and password the first two org id and term id identify the user s organization and the terminal they are logging in from while the other two identify and verify the identity of the user in the example any values for the four parameters should be accepted in my app authentication with the remote server occurs on each request since i cannot keep the remote session open the remote server is very legacy and very paranoid as a result i need to keep the user s credentials in the rails session which i recognize isn t very secure but there you go anyway as it stands the app will not work because in the gemfile i ve fixed the devise version to 224 if you change the devise version to 223 you will be able to log in please let me know if you need anything else peter date tue 28 may 2013 180848 0700 from notifications github com to devise noreply github com cc spierepf hotmail com subject re devise 224 is calling to key on my model class when it shouldn t  2439 we need more information it may as well be caused by storing data devise doesn t know how to deserialize from session can you provide a failing app or a test case to devise suite thanks  reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github 
this line in particular is causing the route problem in the omniauth callbacks controller omniauthcallbackscontroller function e g facebook sign in and redirect user event authentication either i simply don t call the function would that be fine or i need to do something before that makes it work i m assuming the sign in and redirect does more than just redirecting the url maybe that s a wrong assumption 
i digged into it a bit and i think that it doesn t evaluate the response of the underlying app but handles login based on the path that is called see call in strategy rb https github com intridea omniauth blob master lib omniauth strategy rb l 172 l172 however i rewinded a couple of month and didn t find any trace back then either so maybe i am looking at the wrong place since i lack time to dig deeper i ll open an issue at omniauth guess they ll know best 
so this is not something you have heard of or experienced i mean it is a fairly simple setup not sure if the query is causing a problem or the redirect i should also mention i m using postgresql if that matters at all here is the request log started post users login for 1921688208 at 20130508 235953 0400 processing by users sessions controller sessionscontroller create as html parameters utf 8 utf8 authenticity token m k dzw w z g c dmi tjdn f p m1kdzw4wz8gcdmitjdnf4p l sjn zv arxq jpw fw lsjn87zv2arxq23jpwfw user login grex password filtered remember me 0 commit login m 1m m user 35muser load ms 12ms m 0m select users from users where lower username  grex or lower email  grex order by users id asc limit 1 redirected to http 1921688208 completed 302 found in ms 87406ms active record activerecord ms 43ms 
josevalim i wasn t able to find it but it seems like the error is rescued somewhere inside warden
not at the moment is there anything else i can do to help 
from my application html erb  here s output img src https dl dropboxusercontent com u png 2244021420130922192717png alt 
thanks for replying josevalim what do you mean by explicitly configured maybe we could have a spree configuration setting for it to force the path 
devise version is 310
well i m forced to make my own registrations controller registrationscontroller not inherited from devise registrations controller registrationscontroller i ve taken the cancel action from there i need such an action to be able to cancel a registration via omniauth maybe i just need to manually remove session keys in question that would be more explicit and wouldn t touch the guts of devise thanks 
you say it s an issue in the docs and you closed the issue without it being solved  i ll see if i have time this weekend 
let me see if i can reproduce this in the new app 
here it is keep in mind that there are lots of gem which are not required but mentioned in gemfile this rep i just keep updating to latest gems https github com rtcoms railsstarter
sure i ll whip something up later today 
absolutely as stated above i have the application hosted on heroku url http testdomain dcmdashboard com email moderator example com password password
here is an rspec test  please note i get the same response when using curl with rails s

not 100 sure i was just hacking an exploritory upgrade to rails 4 on a rails api app i was seeing the error in tests and rails console it was definitely booting though i was using the last version with token authenticatble in so that might be a clue even if by design imo this should raise an exception or return a token generator that errors when creating tokens returning nil seems a little strange
it make sense but i still don t like it  anyway thank you for your answer 
i m setting up a demo app maybe we find the issue together then 
ah i see sorry my bad thanks solved now 
i knew it was a problem with rails somehow ignoring my serializer in my controller i wrote this  basically i man handled the code to use the right serializer and it s working fine now i m not sure if this is the default behaviour or caused by some of the custom code i ve written since i m using ember js emberjs for the front end but maybe it s worth adding to the readme 
i will take a look on that 
hi jos thanks for your fast answer i am using devise 341 and as far as i can see it a fix should have been merged with this commit https github com plataformatec devise pull 3153 no as far as i can see the branch was merged on oct rd 3rd 2014 while 341 was released on oct 29 2014
actually solved it the problem solution lied in the hack so for awhile i d been using this successfully def self serialize from session key salt record to adapter get key oid 0oid record if record record authenticatable salt salt end but i had to replace it with def self serialize into session record record id to s record authenticatable salt end would love to better understand what s going on here i don t actually understand what s going on
let me know if this is too much to ask of you or too heavy handed of a sample but the project in question is the current build of open farm openfarm https github com openfarmcc open farm openfarm we just had a new developer join that hit this error after getting thing up and running so i m not the only one and i think it should be easy to replicate off the bat thank you for the help and quick replies nashby bow 
i think i d like to see the base devise library address this one because i think it s easy enough but also doing it in devise async would make sense happy to write up a patch for both 
both of those requests may take a considerable amount of time i m not sure my employer will approve my taking a couple days to rip out unicorn and try something else or rip 90 of the code out to create a suitable example app just to narrow down this bug which we have a workaround for it sounds like this isn t a known issue with devise one of my co workers suggested that perhaps devise makes a web call in order to build the email which requires another thread to complete the action but devise is blocking the only thread available  does that sound plausible 
devise yml doesn t have these keys give me the key if you can 
it seems to be defined here https github com plataformatec devise blob a b d f bac f c b d b b lib 1a0192201b317d3f1bac88f5c5b4926d527b1b39lib devise controllers helpers rb  those helpers are convenience methods added to application controller applicationcontroller documentation for it http www rubydoc info github plataformatec devise devise controllers helpers class methods classmethods devise group am i missing something

sorry i thought devise strategies rememberable extend remember me period had something to do with it since it always gets called and looking at some historic commits e deb b e e e c e f 7 2e43944567deb0b376e764e2362613e886c3e4f7 a aaa fcee a bf a d ad d 08 7029a5aaa88fcee9a9bf25a63d0105ad97728d08 i presumed it s purpose is to update remember created at on the resource but it seems it doesn t do that anymore c aba d b c e fe c f a b d 24 c92996646aba2d25b2c3e235fe0c4f1a84b70d24 changes the serialize into cookie to always return time now as the generated at which looking at the check in devise models rememberable remember me 
it appears to only happen after a migration i m able to reproduce it when i create new migrations or i m pulling in new work that requires i run migrations i of course have to reset the server when i run migrations but the error appears to happen in that first run it fixes itself after i reset the server again it s all very confusing sorry 
i m using devise 356
gemfile lock i ve got it only in production wired stuff now i ve roll back and i ll try to play with it on holidays now i m dizzy too much

hi headius thank you for your reply i m running j ruby jruby 167 could this be something that was fixed on pre 1 17pre1
headius with eutf 8 j ruby jruby is able to generate the file test xml just fine under windows xp no more conversion error thank you 
no returned items 
it is unfortunatly a real thing but few java api s support it
the spaceship operator does appear to use compare to compareto for a solution i went ahead and implemented equals on the classes that were giving me problems which seems to be a better practice anyway i was just surprised to see the behavior change 
that i m not sure i have a vague memory of verifying it in both directions but here i have only reported the case of doing the test during dst i can probably retest against the same version and trunk the next time i have access to the windows computer 
sounds spot on  guess i m updating nice of maven not to just fail outright when it can t handle a build 
the problem occurs with j ruby jruby 173 haven t tried any other versions this does not happen with all png files i know that the picture looks invalid as i described above it has been pre compiled by xcode see http iphonedevelopment blogspot com iphone 200810iphone optimized pngs html for more information so it will look invalid to any other application that is why i need to apply the normalizing in the first place again mri can handle this exact same image while j ruby jruby does not 
the minimal example is weirdly if i run this script without rdebug it doesn t enter in the debugger and if i run any script without require debug but with rdebug it doesn t do it either both conditions have to be met apparently i didn t notice it before since i was just comparing it with mri 
it s a near full implementation as far as i can tell is there a document on testing practices 
headius thank you for that in return i added the spec that you suggested https github com ruby spec pull 596 it works on mri but fails on jruby 91160 haven t tested with jruby master but running rvm install jruby head now so will check once it s done 
ah thank you that solves the help thing gemfile 
latest version 179 i switched to jruby just a few days ago 
i just installed jruby head with rvm and tested that it reproduces my test file content was 
hi yes i get the same behaviour with ar 4114 and activerecord jdbc postgresql adapter 1319 and jruby 1723
sure most or all of this functionality may be exposed via jmx beans but it may not be or may not be accessible for whatever reason 
headius the entire contents of the rake file is  my conclusion from this is that because java has a secure random securerandom class and ruby has the same class that they are conflicting enebo do you guys run the rails test suite i also upgrade rails regularly so if a new update comes out i usually upgrade security or other wise 
jruby 1720 deployed on websphere 
ok thank you it worked for me 
from the viewpoint of functionality if it is just a warning it really is not a big deal however if you have as in my case a system consisting of plenty of zsh shell scripts each calling lots of j ruby jruby programs seeing all the warnings looks confusing and is not something i would like to hand over to my customer as professional work from my side my customer might argue that i m using a programming language implementation which is not done in a good way since i not only want to get my work done somehow but also demonstrate the pros of j ruby jruby i certainly want to avoid this warning to pop up a solution which i could do for myself would be to write a wrapper script around j ruby jruby which catches stderr and filters out exactly this warning but since i m likely not the only person seeing this warning if it is difficult to fix the root cause would it be possible to disable this warning by a command line switch kind of no warning stty  or maybe a switch to disable stty nostty if i could control this by an environment variable too it would be even more convenient kind of jruby options 
actually the feature to have each string contain its own encoding was introduced in c ruby cruby 19 see for instance http nuclearsquid com writings ruby encodings 19encodings and http ruby doc org core string 193string html method i encoding i don t think that the bug is about using the wrong encoding internally otherwise using i e japanese characters in my string wouldn t work correctly but that string encoding does not return the correct information it would be helpful to compare this with c ruby cruby 193 but i don t have one here btw i tried the same with jruby 9040 also on windows and got the same behaviour but since we unfortunately have to work with j ruby jruby 17 i m also interested in getting it fixed for this version 
 i had an override done on mysql connection mysql2connection https gist github com wok 1367987 which says establishes a connection to the database that s used by all active record objects but since mysql connection mysql2connection http apidock com rails active record activerecord base mysql connection mysql2connection class is deprecated it can be ignored smile  i have escaped the quotes in a string using mysql client mysql2client escape which actually should have been done in a more abstract rails way    solution instead of mysql client mysql2client escape use active record activerecord base connection quote string both should give same results    jruby   this is great heart j ruby jruby
im happy to submit a spec to make sure it does not regress in the future if i have some free time over the holiday weekend i may also set up a git bisect to track down the breaking change since im curious what caused it

harshvardhansharma i found this  4393 and 1951 but they are not about files i think it s a flaw in j ruby jruby but can t say for sure because not worked with him closely 
the reason is that cacerts s format is invalide it has nothing to do with j ruby jruby i replace the cacerts in java home jre lib security to resolve the error
i have a python script for bootstraping jruby with jekyll on a windows 7 machine because as i have written in 4890 i need to later run jekyll on build machines with no internet access the bootstrap python script does the following steps  unpack jruby dist bin 91150bin tar gz call gem bat install http proxy http username password proxy example com 8080 jekyll i have to note that bin jruby has the expected shebang usr bin env bash it s also correct usr bin env jruby for e g bin gem and other shell scripts that are already in jruby dist bin 91150bin tar gz however all shell scripts in bin that have been pulled by the call to gem only have the  jruby shebang 
thanks headius i know it could be in our dependency library but the error went away after putting concurrency settings to 1 ie defeating the purpose of j ruby jruby we want to have concurrency settings back though so it s definitely the concurrency born issue but we are not able to pinpoint whether it s the runtime causing it or dependent libraries which in our case could be any of the 15 gems do you have any suggestions to find non thread safe code or libraries 
enebo the above script completes without any failures for me there is one important difference between the two scripts in the original script there were two threads that were concurrently accessing the same io one reading in the thread and one writing the main thread as well as a single thread that reads and writes from the other socket the intent was to have a server could concurrently read and write from the server socket while the client could read and write from the client socket the read nonblock is not supposed to be reading the data written to the socket it should get an eagain every time it attempts to read the main assumption here is that the io object was threadsafe to concurrent reads and writes perhaps this assumption is just incorrect my inspiration for this line of investigation was this issue https github com jruby jruby issues 4854 and the problem could be modeled with a tcp socket instead which is how i discovered this problem in the first place

right you are the new version of the jdk came with an update to solaris there were old versions of bouncy castle bouncycastle in usr java jre lib ext perhaps left over from previous work i did i was previously using a separately installed jdk and when i switched to the version bundled with solaris to get the new version of the jdk these old jre lib ext jar files were now being found and used causing this problem thanks for the hint and sorry to bother you 
headius same thing happening with ruby 253 as well

yeah i know its a trivial alias i just filed in the interest of maintaining general compatibility thanks for knocking this one out 
sweet thank you christopher for pointing that out didn t noticed it at a first glance and it would be more readable if there was of segment ofsegment instead of two of points ofpoints also of line segment intersection oflinesegmentintersection http openframeworks cc documentation math of math ofmath html show of line segment intersection oflinesegmentintersection function could be a method of an of segment ofsegment instance it doesn t really belongs to more general of math ofmath category if you think about it

hi bilderbuchi yes i m using 007 version i will try also with version 0071 i willt try this evening see you 
obviousjim thanks your grabber works great of theo oftheo i tried to run on 1073 gb 4gb ddr 3 ddr3 253 intel core 2 duo this is macbook pro 2009 also i m using of 007
it also took me all day to track down this bug that code actually has a and b initialized in the project i m working on that i copied it from i don t care about the values of a b and c being garbage though that s just the minimal code i could give as an example that is causing memory corruptions elsewhere in the tinynurbs library in this case when glm force ctor init is defined makes sense that is might be due to different defines for glm in different files based on includes will have a look later 
sorry forgot to mention that i use vs 2010 i made no modification to the solutions just run the compile all examples compileallexamples bat setup commandline setupcommandline bat to create the exe the opencv examples in 007 work in release debug zach i alread run dependencywalker over the exe but get no hint what s going wrong it shows the same as in the 007 example don t know if dependency walker dependencywalker gives useful information when using a static lib

i ve tried that but there s a big difference between the vals when using of matrix x 4 ofmatrix4x4 i know this works with matrix x 3 matrix3x3
correct haven t worked to track down where that s coming from yet though a more error proof way to perform this check would be to first check the status variable to see if the shader failed to compile and only check err against gl no error in the case that it s still false

one way to approach the terms at issue if not the current function with categories and series and sections is by drawing on the example of the leading preprint servers three of the key players ar xiv arxiv org https arxiv org about biorxiv org https www biorxiv org and ssrn https www ssrn com stanford idm oclc org index cfm en  each use different terms fields subject areas and networks respectively for how all of the content on the server is divided into one of what could also be called disciplines or topics e g architecture physics biochemistry each server has their own limited set of topics and for readers browsing this approach make great sense only ar xiv arxiv org the oldest has categories within fields e g machine learning within stats as well as allowing for cross lists that place a paper in two categories all three allow you to browse by field subject area and network respectively while i find categories closer to this discipline based approach than series the three main servers make it clear that there are no standard terms still i d propose that the server manager perhaps on the advice of the advisory committee set out the server s categories or some other term for this sort of thing with authors having to choose one or two if possible keywords can be used to designate type of study such as review clinical tria l trial and i see series as a more advanced feature for down the road to be used to designate and group a set of papers from a conference or a lab with the series something an author could ask a manager to set up for a specific list of authors in the server i do hope that this might advance the work on this aspect of ops

thanks for the quick reply well sort of yes  in the roles tab i see that admin has the role jornal editor and expected that this is the role for assigning submissions to review hence give admin the rights to do so but only if i assign journal manager as a role to the admin the account is able to do so by the way if i assign external user and author to the same user that user can be assigned to review his very own maniscript should there be a check to prevent this situation i will send a pull request these days for some german translations that i did 
i don t know much sql besides basic queries so i m not of much help here i can workaround my problem with the in house temp server i don t know how prevalent is the gtid setting if that is something that is used in all servers with replication mirroring i can see that as being a problem for a lot of users and i would still consider it a bug

xcode 42 app store appstore version so llvm and gcc is installed the variable i ll check as soon as i am at home
in short 41 still uses the llvm gcc that makes 42 so painful for other rubies yet it still distributes a copy of plain ol gcc the cc environment variable above instructs the build system that ree uses to use the plain old gcc i suspect this will work in any situation in which usr bin gcc 42 exists as a file e g test x or test e

thanks for the hints richo i never really cared for my zshrc shamelessly copy pasted it together from various sources a few years ago never had any problem so far i tried to kinda bisect the ugly setopt block nothing really changed while doing so however after commenting out the whole thing the problem with rvm was suddenly gone everything works as expected now suprisingly after re enabling all setopt lines zsh started to complain about missing a few of the functions in there fair enough most are not to be found anywhere to be honest i have no idea why my zsh never complained about the before as i said using that config for years now 
envygeeks yes i also did brew update brew upgrade just to make sure cwgem could be i have both x 18x and x 19x installed and i am running the installation with x 19x in the path 
i think the install help the quick curl install line help and https rvm io rvm install 
hm nope i m using zsh so there are no bash files sourced anyways zsh is my default shell and my terminal starts it  zsh i guess is that what you re asking for 
ah i had done rvm get stable with rvm get head wow it s a bit scary it reinstalled git i had a fairly recent git version 1812 plus about a zillion other things but hey it worked thanks so much

my version rvm 1191 stable by wayne e seguin wayneeseguin gmail com michal papis mpapis gmail com https rvm io i use rvm with following code add to my bashrc  i worked with user root because it my personal computer it concern with this 
this is what was wrong without debug  thought it may have been that ruby version so tried it with ruby p 0 200p0 but got exactly the same error
ok we might have to remember to do add the rubygems version part but it would still be another thing to keep track of we ended up changing the rvm curl functions to add the following to each curl call against api github com h authorization token user token see this blog post for more info http www lornajane net posts github 2012github api access tokens via curl i guess if this is a bigger problem those rvm curl functions could have some check to see if a github token is passed on the command line or set in the user s environment and if so the h authorization token user token piece could be added to the curl system call thanks very much tehmasp
i went 63 to be conservative but yeah i agree i think that it s compatible with the major version 
mpapis thanks for helping me with this here is the log i think its the same as the above not really anything new https gist github com benjohnson 776367648 benjohnson776367648 i had actually moved by down grading rvm to 1188 and then installing from there so in order to reproduce this i only had to change back to head and run my chef stuff against a new debian 7 vm on google compute engine same error happened again easily 
no it doesn t install even without the patch 
good point yes it does  i still wonder why curl cares about this cert though neutral face

pkuczynski sorry for lack of response it works just fine with that patch 
hi pkuczynski
pkuczynski hi i have open ssl openssl c 110c 10 nov 2016
the above output is w o libffi devel only i installed that package manually after wards to remove failure as a remediation 
pkuczynski these are the outputs 
sorry for the delay looking into it now 
yes you can submit patches to the mailing list however don t bother with old package managers like fink 
i was using this theme http gist github com 368305 i did not like zsh overall for its experience annoyance i had another problem with it if you try to cd tab it showed me files like config file which don t exist in my current folder i just uninstalled oh my zsh 
allaire i don t know where to check that care to elaborate please stibbons i only have two repositories where every change is commited 
thank you very much but rm this file i need to install oh my zsh againt
my current zshrc is as follows 
what yes of course i do have git extras installed i also added the git extras plugin but it doesn t work for me as described above 
 yes i am able to do a cd a  yes the behaviour soed persist even if i go out into a subdirectory of a and go directly back into it it is still expanded a source of oh my zsh sh does not help  i use my own theme copied parts of different themes so this might be wrong the important part seems to be 
i try set the font in the iterm 2 iterm2 preference and restarted the iterm 2 iterm2 am i doing right here 
yes they are normal 
well so far i ve added the code below to my current zshrc  i m not sure how to integrate it into the build prompt method so it looks right with the current theme agnoster 
i was just curious about some of the suggestions git local fetch was intriguing but when i did a git help local fetch there were no existing man page then i just compared the completion list of the plugin with git commands that were removed or deprecated to check if there was more and see if i should or not open a ticket 
thank you so much for the hint with infocmp i m so much intimidated by this terminfo issues i don t understand why this is so hard and so complicated and so hard to agree on the diff between the infocmp of the main machine shows the difference  even though both systems are open su se opensuse tumbleweed and have the same terminfo package terminfo base x 8664 60122x8664 but then i remembered the unfortunate issue that the su se suse maintainer could not agree with the urxvt maintainers about the correct terminfo i installed urxvt from source some weeks ago as some bugfix came along this overwrote the file usr share terminfo r rxvt unicode color 256color when i force reinstall the terminfo base everything is fine again so this is a terminfo urxvt issue not related to zsh sorry for bothering you why this only happens with ctrl d and not with exit also puzzles me but i m really happy now thanks again 
ostype darwin 130 darwin130 shell bin zsh
yes i am using finger print reader i installed oh my zsh as normal user on debian testing 
that makes sense i m on os x but using the homebrew coreutils package which replaces system utilities with the proper gnu ones due to the way oh my zsh works usr local opt coreutils libexec gnubin is prepended to path after it s set its aliases so it tests the system ls not the one i m actually using i couldn t say whether it s worth testing for and handling that particular configuration no idea how many people are using coreutils from homebrew and oh my zsh but thanks for explaining why it was messed up on my system i fixed it be re aliasing ls should i close this issue 
apple terminal true 
the cheat sheet but at beginning cannot easy to remember the alias if git and other plugins have the way to look the plugin locally will be good
ncanceill yes those are the exact steps to reproduce if i type a partial path this also triggers the freeze when pressing tab i should also mentioned i m running os x yosemite 10103 i m happy to help find the commit but i m not familiar with git bisect 
gpu https github com robbyrussell oh my zsh blob b a fd ab e bb f ca f plugins 599831b85a5fd4564ab820530e2bb45f37ca3f99plugins git git plugin zsh l 175 l175 became aliased before my own gpu alias so i had to unalias gpu 
apjanke thanks i ve updated the gist https gist github com kamalx fae f a acdc a 24fae1f64059a7acdc6a with the files you mentioned above 
i have zsh 511 the rare is that before work without put i try this 
here it is https gist github com fbbdev b abaa c d 6799015 b12abaa00c89d6799015 i suspect it s a key mapping problem home and end keys also stopped working on the command line 
thanks for the suggestion ctrl w does obviously help over just holding the delete key however i m still suggesting an essentially undo command for tab completion rather than still having to delete by word it would just jump back to the previous forward slash 
yes the error is 
in zshrc i have only plugins git i ve disabled it for a while but issue still persists 
yes that was the reason for the error i tried editing check for upgrade sh but couldn t get it to work for me it would also likely be overwritten whenever zsh updates it turned out that upgrade oh my zsh works fine so i m just disabling automatic update and i ll update either manually or with a fortnightly cron job changes could be made to oh my zsh to avoid these issues but i don t have a sufficient understanding of linux and oh my zsh to do this 
mcornella hi thanks for asking the directions in the earlier https github com robbyrussell oh my zsh issues 5309 issuecomment 240333061 made it work 
there was nothing wrong with zshrc file as i fixed it by 1 backup zshrc file 2 uninstall scm breeze 3 uninstall zsh 4 install zsh 5 install scem breeze 6 restore zshrc file backup without any changes it helped 
input
rjrobinson tried that as well does not work on all systems though atk 91 atk91 force of habit doing that which is why i typed it out here as well
hi grawlinson thanks for the tip i used user and it did the trick now where would i have to place this to take effect everytime i start the iterm 2 iterm2 many thanks again 
executing the installation script from within bash always worked fine on linux one of the things the script does is actually changing the default shell from bash to zsh in any case the script runs in sh no matter if run from bash or zsh 
trauta i m using the bin bash currently there is no any zsh config in etc passwd my system is mac os x ei capitan
yes agnoster zsh theme as well as other themes exists under oh my zsh folder thanks

command which a bi return bi aliased to bundle install 
just to make myself clear using the term user may be misleading to mean user at a system level what i meant is for a given user in a terminal session you have the option of creating and switching between different profiles although most of the customization options are available here i was wondering if i could link even the shell themes on a per profile basis the main idea is when i am doing certain for example dev projects i prefer the clean minimal robbyrussell default theme look of the environment but when i am doing certain other projects for example server end stuff i prefer all the bells and whistles and with the powerline plugin tmux and everything else is there a way to minimize the effort by saving settings shell theme to profiles and simply switching between profiles 
1 theme robbyrussell https github com robbyrussell oh my zsh wiki themes 2 echo term in both environments output is the same xterm color 256color 3 infocmp in both environments output is the same 
when run compaudit there didnt return anything in my terminal and alsothere are which compdef print as below
how to install mysqladmin 5 mysqladmin5 can i run brew install mysqladmin 5 mysqladmin5 
on free bsd freebsd and perhaps other termcap based systems it outputs the current width of the terminal in characters while the plugin expects it to be the number of colours supported by the terminal 
locale 
that fixed it thanks 
i am currently using   set name of the theme to load if set to random it will   load a random theme each time oh my zsh is loaded in which case   to know which specific one was loaded run echo random theme   see https github com robbyrussell oh my zsh wiki themes  zsh theme powerlevel k powerlevel10k powerlevel k powerlevel10k   set list of themes to pick from when loading at random   setting this variable when zsh theme random will cause zsh to load   a theme from this variable instead of looking in oh my zsh themes   if set to an empty array this variable will have no effect  zsh theme random candidates agnoster 
in my zshrc file i have the following configuration
mcornella it is xterm color 256color 
all other lines are commented out i only changed the theme from default 
here is the output 
ideal would be a plain text version of the express html exception page 
there s mongoose stuff following it but i thought express would redirect before getting to the mongoose stuff anyhow i ll ask nw tonight if it s a bug or what i m doing wrong if it s me 
done https gist github com 906110
that makes sense but my agent is sending application json and the server is using a custom json schema validator i have two options either send the request in another not parseable format like text plain the client has to change it s implementation and that s just not the right or stringify and parse again point is i don t want body parser bodyparser to work on some routes because i d like to read the body myself is there a way to create a custom express pipeline for certain routes that would do the trick i think if we are gonna get rid of a feature like this we really need to offer an alternative not to mention including it in the migration guide in http expressjs com 
i realised that the error only occurs with this configuration app configure function  app use express static dirname app 
not entirely the to replicate the problem try calling  both of those throw really really unhelpful error messages could we put some sort of check at the start of the app render method to throw a nice helpful error message if there s no function provided the error in the first case is extremely cryptic the error in the second case is less than ideal 
i found a workaround for people searching i originally had something like this 
how does one run with debug connect express 
i did it without and with the forward slash the same 500 error exist i use swig i used it with and without consolidate same error exist 
either way if you do decide to keep support for them i think it would be best to at least document it or make it behave more like expected currently passing an array doesn t run the parameter handlers before the array callback my use for them is setting up middleware that runs on many routes checking auth and ownership of objects but it requires that the parameter handler be called first it s understandable why it would also be removed too but i think it shouldn t be a half complete support it should either removed or works like it intuitively should in my opinion 
a string representation of the document like 
i do that in a view 
i look in chrome developer tool and see the single request i m interested in the following why console log shows full url api v controller v1controller action and without base path controller action 
dougwilson defunctzombie the sample code is already opensource and part of the flod https github com spumko flod project available there  https github com spumko flod tree master examples express 40324 i just copy pasted the folder and updated the express version to compare the two 
currently i have set the middleware to restrict everything over 1 kb i attempted to bypass the express limit middleware with a 60 mb txt file although it took the python request quite a long time to submit the request i was still able to upload the file should i try an even larger file the python line i attempted was the same as last time and again was successful requests post http localhost upload files filename open file txt r headers content length 1 this python line without the header modification was unsuccessful requests post http localhost upload files filename open file txt r giving me this error request entity to large

i learned of this from a blog some time ago that had a better explanation than the mdn text but i can t find that reference so here is a better example run from a clean node repl  simple object var triangle a 1 b 2 c 3 for var key in triangle console log key  outputs lines a b c  however if you add to the object prototype even a simple scalar variable not a function object prototype dummy x  then the previous line for var key in triangle console log key  outputs lines a b c and dummy  because in iterates over properties  instead use of to iterate over the object keys array as intended for var key of object keys triangle console log key  outputs lines a b c i don t see how this will break object create as it just simply iterates over keys not properties as intended for the code in this case alternatively you can use has own property hasownproperty as suggested in the link second example but i find that more verbose and less clear not the original article but this article explains it too https www carlschroedl com blog comp avoid for in in javascript https 20141105https www carlschroedl com blog comp avoid for in in javascript 20141105
next layer or does that term get confused with existing usage in the codebase i know there s already a construct called a layer 
here is the error generated by the above example  the regular expression does not accept as a parameter 
i find express 4 different from express 3 i get following error
well but is this the only timeout that kills a request from the server end or are there more timeouts i need to deal with 
i will test and get back to you

hi doug approval for release of the code spinet is being gathered in the mean time a url directly to a m a m4a file on the server will demonstrate the issue at hand compare this with mp 3 mp3 file kr alex on wed jul 16 2014 at 545 am douglas christopher wilson notifications github com wrote   alex ramia one live onelive inc o 17028606161 c 17024666609 oneliveinc com this email and any files transmitted with it may contain confidential information that is legally privileged and is intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed if you are not the intended recipient or a person responsible for delivering it to the intended recipient you are hereby notified that any disclosure copying dissemination distribution or use of any of the information contained in or attached to this transmission is strictly prohibited if you have received this email in error please notify the sender by reply email or by telephone at 702 4666609 and destroy the original transmission and its attachments without reading or saving them in any manner 
the path being used is c code web testing my app name packages client app public it comes to about ish 60ish i think and there are no spaces in there just hyphens and underscores the thing that strikes me as odd though is that path was exactly the same when it was working it was just invoked from the main app js file not from a required file i am not sure if it changes anything but the requires return a promise too but it is handled correctly and i have logged output and everything gets evaluated as i would expect its just when i go to a route it blows up with the static handler 
sorry for not opening the issue in the right place i did read the guidelines but it says website and i just didn t process it as documentation also i think a common format would benefit everyone not just dash users or just users of dash like apps which are available for windows and linux as well velocity http velocity silverlakesoftware com zeal http zealdocs org and dev docs devdocs http devdocs io are the ones i know of as for available offline i would imagine if it gets support from npm it would be handled just like docs are handled for gems right now the docs are generated and installed locally on the user s machine after the gem is installed i think text editors would benefit from documentation inside code as well as they d be able to show quick docs alongside autocomplete or something like that sorry if i m talking non sense i never wrote anything in node 
i m still waiting for a new http request here is all the code handling my routes 
no need to solve it for a single pathological case if nobody else is reporting it i seem to be able to workaround for now by consolidating routes a note in the docs might be nice since this was hard to figure out of course making a simple test case makes it disappear although this issue itself is sort of documentation feel free to close or wontfix thanks dougwilson
348 we do have plans to upgrade but it probably won t be live before we need to deal with this do you know when this was dealt with and how my hack is just to delete all req query instanceof array objects early in the request i don t think we re using any of that fancy functionality 
when i use chrome incognito everything works great like in safari 
i m sorry to have bothered you it is not an expressjs problem the issue lies with github com caolan quip which is a response module as soon as you plug it on the app app use quip res status send 204send becomes 200 before that it works as expected i will work out the exact issue and query the author of quip instead thanks for the suggestions for further reference the testcase 
i know doug wilson was committing to express and other tj s project since its beginning and i appreciate his work however i don t know if he works for strongloop now and have less free time please look at commits there are nothing except new npm versions and some docs since august and a very few before pr for async route handlers was introduced in november and not merged yet https github com strongloop express pull 2809 release 50 was initiated on july but stale since november https github com strongloop express pull 2237
me not having to type user for router all user get all x as for why i need such specialized route endings and don t do get like is advertised here http expressjs com en api html router is because everything is on post for security and some routes get complicated like user get all email or user remove pinned 
version 411 thanks for the hint i can see in the source code that the most recent version has a fix for this https github com strongloop express blob master lib application js l 167 l167 therefore i close this issue sorry for the inconvenience

i cannot provide a sample reproduction for i don t know what the ids ips is sending to my site so i will add a console log res in index js and wait for the next request to trigger this function call or maybe you may want i run node with special parameters i don t know how that will log function agument values 
i temporarily added this to my code this morning at the very beginning where i log incoming requests i removed the logging code just to verify that it wasn t me that was putting it in there somehow i never use proto  so if you want to loop through the keys in query to see what query parameters are available things get a little strange  hope this helps clarifying the issue julian
digging into this and yes i m suspecting it s something with firefox installing a different browser now to confirm
oh by not expected i mean i was expecting the exact result i put it to come out after seeing the code and reading the docs i understood why it was there but i was using location without realising there was special case for the word back if it had been something like back or referrer something that is not a valid url safe then i doubt i would have encountered it 
i tried to follow express quick start tutorial from npm page for which i tried to use express generator to create a sample app but when trying to use npm start command it showed me the above modules where installed by the previous npm install command i thought maybe someone missed to write them in the script plus the name of jade has been changed when i installed all these modules one after another by following the error messages npm start was working for me this the version of express 4152
hi dougwilson thank you very much i apologise for the lack of details can you modify your files as such  curl http order 1270013000order job testing 123 testing123 will then give you response sent from mw order instead of mw job

sorry to post what seems to be a stackoverflow question at first i thought that was an unexpected behavior and decided to open this issue but now i understand why i got these redirects before closing this thread i d be glad to hear if you know any way to redirect all ur ls urls to the same base url what i am trying to achieve is to redirect all requested ur ls urls to the same index file except for resources files js css png jpg etc thanks
i am using node js v 10130 v10130 express version 4164 i get the warning when i use res download i will try to create a small example and get back to you on that but am a bit pushed for time from my perspective it is probably not urgent enough to create a patch instead of just including it in your minor release what is the eta for your minor release 
hi wesleytodd thanks for your reply improving my question i have a middleware responsible for authentication using jwt i would like to force all routes of my application to be authenticated by this middleware 
yes it works i will do thankyou 
yes of course i have the version express 4171 in package json i used iisnode to publish my node server
that s a fair response doug i suppose the hack would be to stream the response to a temporary file and provide that to the view engine ok it s much work such a shame 
i have to change the response to b 64 b64 and while consuming in my ui again change it 
sure just updated the issue description by the way i m not professing any deep knowledge of express here its merely an issue i have encountered 
i tried with the latest and it works now thanks 
no good reason i just happened to be in the wrong directory at the wrong time and i figured i d report it as i searched for similar known issues and didn t find anything 
opyate yes adding fork in run true to build sbt fixes the problem maybe run should be forked by default 
i ve done cleans before and then later gotten this error or do you mean that a clean should allow me to re run compile and have it work 
because i have other settings that depend on this build thisbuild scala version scalaversion 
that s a good suggestion i was publishing the scala build actually so i didn t want to modify the build script too heavily it s all part of an automation pipeline 
hi everybody i ve found the cause i m using tcc le and it was applying some special logic to fix such a broken path so i was able to use javac from command line this of course did not affect process builder processbuilder api thanks for your attetntion 
no all events are posted from the same thread synchronizing the event handler eventhandler calls does not make a difference i also added some debug logging to see which thread id posts an event as you can see it fails to retain the events even though they are all handled on the same thread 
ah sorry the original repo is private you should be able to access it now but the problem can also be reproduced with https github com slick slick just run doctest test runs the correct tests for doctest then comment out both test grouping testgrouping lines in build scala reload and run again now it runs the tests for test instead of doctest 
yep that would be a workaround i like the a b c syntax it faster to navigate 
duhemm how would this work with the new filewatcher https github com sbt sbt issues 3369 issuecomment 318007542
finally i use a proxy it works 
hmm yeah i guess it is still possible to call out ok then i retract this being a blocker for 10 but it would certainly be an improvement of the auto plugin autoplugin api and be another reason for people to move over 
sonofa i used the scripts from https github com wsargent docker scala sbt blob master images shell zshenv l 13 l13 but forgot i was specifically overriding repo so i could get it to work with artifactory https github com wsargent docker scala sbt artifactory my bad you can close this out 
in the wild here https github com gemini hlsw gem blob eugene build sbt l 267 l267 note the tag a naive minimization doesn t exhibit the problem i ll try to isolate it tomorrow 
i ve tried it with the following java versions zulu 80212zulu zulu 1102zulu zulu 1103zulu zulu 1201zulu
this is where it locks up
to run the project sbt run activator run port listening as i write play application i need to run it that mean i need to be able to run an http service an get response from my service to do that i need to execute command i ve mentioned in the first line please do not hesitate to ask me if you have any other questions thank you igor on oct 12 2014 741 pm josh suereth notifications github com wrote 
yes i forgot to reply rc 2 rc2 fixed the issue 
0136 sorry should ve mentioned 
still the exact same error message 
activator is 1210 and uses sbt 0135
i believe i found the issue and it was my stupidity in ordering of version vs version in this build thisbuild 
by sbt msi 0138msi
i ll post an example repo shortly 
no we do not use it we only have a forwarder for it in cross project crossproject https github com scala js scala js blob v sbt v069sbt plugin src main scala scala scalajs sbtplugin cross cross project crossproject scala l l 270 l264l270 i m equally fine if you drop it in which case we ll drop our forwarder 
yup it now sets the path correctly thanks 
not very severe i can work around it easily it just makes my build even more ugly p
good question unfortunately i get the same error 
good question that sounds likely should overwrite be true if that s the case it s kind of annoying to have to drop open and re publish signed publishsigned all cross built projects 70 artifacts in scalameta scalameta in case maven validation fails for a single artifact e g missing javadoc in my limited time with sbt 10 i ve found the overwrite false change to be quite painful for local development i don t recall having experienced problems with overwrite true in 013 besides the warning messages saying it will be removed in 10 causing me to miss other important messages in the console is it possible to configure sbt 10 to use overwrite true somewhere globally using snapshot is not an option for large multi module builds in my experience resolution is too slow 
i don t know the details of what collect analyses collectanalyses does from my perspective sbt server provides a generic solution for clients to trigger tasks and commands via sbt exec i would leave it to clients to decide what to do 
eed si n eed3si9n thanks for your response we are using the typesafe config library where the resolution of the configuration settings is dependent on the order that reference conf and or application conf are found on the classpath that means if we have a common component that is used across a number of subprojects then we have to copy the test configuration to every subproject this is possibly fine for a single case but it gets unwieldy and difficult to manage with many shared components if sbt was consistent with the order of the classpath then this would be relatively trivial i e it would just work my expectation was definitely that test classes for a project or subproject should always come before classes based on my experience using maven 
sure basically every standard ubuntu cloud environment such as c 9 c9 codenvy etc these are typically 14045 lts here is an example from c 9 c9 in a freshly created blank workspace 
sadly after few library updates and a bit of changes in code though not in module for which stack overflow exception stackoverflowexception happened upgrade to 121 seems to be working fine next week i might try to find the commit at which upgrade didn t work and then try to narrow down project but no promises 
i don t think it s a duplicate no just repeated the steps above using sbt new lagom lagom scala g 8 g8 and sbt version 127 and got similar results several zombie threads 
yes i have tried cached resolution but it does not work for this project as it contains plugins that modify specified artifact versions from 0 to a version read in by an artifact catalog more like maven dependency management when cached resolution was turned on it interpreted the version as 0 basically before the plugin version modification takes place we may be able to fix this at the plugin our own sbt plugin code but it needs investigation for now we have to turn cached resolution off the other part of our project https github com paypal squbs uses 01315 with cached resolution and all works fine the internal part of the same has much messier dependencies 
013
i followed your suggestion however it doesn t change the behavior all the java code gets compiled four times here s a transcript of the cross paths crosspaths and cross scala versions crossscalaversions settings  the root project is the only aggregation project and the scala api scalaapi project is the only scala project all others are pure java projects except for their test code but that doesn t get published anyway 
eed si n eed3si9n wow that worked thank you 
gmethvin good news 267 with sbt 102 does seem to be ok so far limited testing but so far changing javascripts is no longer crashing file watching thanks 
that is weird to see a warning about the 0140 while we are running the 103
ritschwumm debian stretch
yep looking much better in rc 4 110rc4
no i m sorry i m just an sbt user not a scala guy and i don t intend to become one  i d have no idea how to fix that 
works for me but disappointed i cannot use coursier 
sorry for the late reply i had followed those instructions without a hitch just to be on the safe side i did an update and upgrade i also did a new sbt sbt version sbtversion and got the expected 121 i now realize what i did wrong i had previously executed the latter command in a project directory with a build file that explicitly asks for 116 my mistake when you referred to the project build properties file i assumed you were referring to sbt s project my sincere apologizes for taking up your time

yes 128 and rc 3 130rc3 work
eed si n eed3si9n yes i ll prepare a pr during the weekend 
hi i just tested that by using the following procedure 1 i changed the contents of build properties to sbt version 133 2 i ve run sbt update 3 i ve run sbt test same problem i haven t upgraded the system version of sbt though my brew mac says the system version is 128 here is the output of sbt about outside of my project folder 
with the realm blank i still get unauthorized no question about spelling though  setting it to null resulted in a npr

now getting 1146 table django cms south migrationhistory doesn t exist 
yes the first one displays fine the second one gets fixed if i resize a few divs and iframes with firebug it starts out at 330 pixels this happens in firefox chrome and opera 
grrr git hub github dropped my first message about 2 hours ago the good news is that i ve fixed another bug too the first problem is simple example settings py sets language code en us the django default and so i had that in my project too what i didn t notice until i enabled cms middleware multilingual url middleware multilingualurlmiddleware was that this breaks things because en us isn t in languages the example still works because language is actually set a second time further down to de which is in languages the solution for my demo was simple but it seems like the language code in languages and probably default language checks should happen somewhere in the core cms so you always get an informative error rather than silent failures to reproduce 1 copy example 2 remove the language de and multilingual url middleware multilingualurlmiddleware 3 edit a page in the admin i found a second nastier bug which i just fixed on monolingual sites plugin addition will appear to work but the content won t display on the page or the next time you open the page in the admin area this is really two bugs both of which are fixed in this commit http github com acdha django cms commit 20commit cf beea e a a f b b f f b b cf78beea701e1a3a21f9b12b4f60052166f11b4b the first is that the plugin editing view doesn t verify that the post variable language is in settings languages i added a check to to cms admin views py for this the second was the reason i noticed the validation failure in the first place the add plugin java script javascript normally gets the language value from the language selector which doesn t exist if only one language is defined this resulted in entries in the cms cmsplugin table with language undefined i added a simple fallback which looks for the hidden language input if the first check fails chris

piquadrat oh damn i was afraid that this would be your answer this is in the backend admin not in the frontend admin i never use the frontend admin i don t get any js errors but one 404 error failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 not found http localhost static 8000static admin img admin icon addlink gif this might be some hint that my staticfiles settings are not quite right maybe but then again just one file i d rather suspect that you forgot to add that file somehow i m afraid i have to create a new django project from scratch and see if it works my current project has many other dependencies so that might be the problem will report back tomorrow 
yes i tried removing publisher from installed apps and the problem persists while digging around it seems like the plugin is created ok in add plugin in pageadmin py the plugin save call succeeds and plugin pk is set and returned in the request but when edit plugin tries to get the object with the same pk it fails maybe some kind of race condition or timing error also i know the secret key is no longer secret it doesn t matter

hi yakky by the way i think you should have a show menu template tag in your code for this bug to work you should be able to reproduce this with a very simple django app  now try to submit the empty form 
django 124 django cms 213
my bad 2 templatetags were affected 1 addtoblock wasn t in a block 2 inside a templatetag template a templatag was used with a wrong value failing silently issue can be closed sorry
meant the test project in tests project divio django cms da tests 176da10tests project in the zip file 
django django 13django cms develop
actually this is not a nested plugin problem i get this when adding a text plugin as well it s just more apparent when working with nested plugins because the javascript thread exits and no other placeholders get initialised curiously that rouge placeholder bar instantiation at the top has no markup the markup beneath the addtoblock tag in placeholder html associated with it being output to the page swallowed template tag error also the offending placeholder id cms placeholder bar 209 is one larger than the last actual placeholder on the page id 208
there is only one language but i m not sure why that is relevant if i simply don t want anything regarding lanuages to show up in the urls then there isn t a way to make that happen and when i install djangocms it s pip install git git github com divio django cms git 
version is 22 and i am using a custom application which in turn uses place holder admin placeholderadmin 
sorry i should have done a minimal example before posting and then i would realized that this error was caused by part of my code 
digi 604 digi604 just like in any reasonably decent blog acting as some kind of keywords we are using tags to help post news or announcements in proper categories while maintaining lists of recently published news or announcements for example 
johnraz sure the idea is to allow to prepare some prefilled predefined pages for the content managers so it becomes easier for them to create new pages and not have to click together new pages with plugins add a new page select page type or blank as until now  get a predefined page the new plugin in plugin system is very powerful it can be overwhelming for casual users but this system allows for experienced users to rapidly generate various page types for example content page page with gallery page with teasers and so on without have to write a single line of code basically build your page and save it as page type with this extension we basically try to make a first step to expose the power of the plugins to less experienced users it s not a new concept lots of easy to use cms offer this as well so we hope it s a handy extension to the cms hope this makes sense d

hi final angel finalangel i ve just tested the lastest develop and it works like a charme browser chromium 3001599661 x 8664 x8664 thanks
yes i am relatively sure when i click the save button in the admin interface this message appears in the js console of my browser chrome the browser chrome says this in the js console when i click on save  i also didn t find any hardcoded http but somewhere it has to come from or not 
i will try and mock something tonight to showcase the issue it shouldn t be hard to replicate 
i simply have a placeholder in a template  and then i have a couple custom cms plugins in there when i attempt to drag and move a plugin in structure mode i get an error i just did some addn tests and it doesn t seem to matter if i have published the page or not i m also experiencing other issues ie attempting to revert a deleted page results in an error jstree looking in the wrong location for marker gif when opening the page manager from the latest update i m now wondering if my plugin setup is odd i upgraded from 24 to beta 3 and now i m testing the 30 release these features have never worked with my application from the start 
i m using django cms v 243 i do not set cms languages so it uses the one from languages https django cms readthedocs org en latest getting started configuration html 
static placeholder just works for django cms 3 which is in beta i guess i shouldn t post this here anyway i solved my problem using the post save signal for the page model not exactly what i want because it gets published with just saving the plugin content not with clicking the publishing button however this is better than having to go to the back end to publish  digi 604 digi604 it just says cannot import signals when i do import cms signals as cms signals if i stop the execution with the debugger ipdb i can see that cms signals is there i mean import cms and tab however when i execute the command it just show me the error cannot import signals 
i didn t consider that it s chrome on osx mavericks i m not sure what version it would of been but i m on the stable release channel and this was captured on may th 29th
i can t imagine so i m a superuser the toggle button is visible on all other pages i ve looked at i think this could be some kind of odd caching issue i just kept toggling live draft and it appeared then phoned a colleague to say i d got it to appear that way toggled it again and now i can t get it to show up again theres nothing in the console to show js errors so i m at a bit of a loss here 
running a query on the actual id used select from cms page where reverse id personaltrainer landing page returns the expected 2 pages 1 draft 1 live i assume the 10 on the end of the error was something cms related 
i am using an old one django cms 235 as required by arkestra i will do tests with newer versions 
18 latest i just tried to apply the 4 django migrations first and the issue still occurs none of the other django contrib apps had migrations from x 18x to x 111x  i also tried to upgrade through x 34x first i installed 346 with the all of the other packages the same did a full migrate and then installed x 35x and did another full migrate and get the same error as above 
thanks for help i did look well in stacktrace and thanks to it i found that problem was du to an old search setting hidden in sub sub folder i removed it and now it works well 
yeah what hepptux wrote will reproduce it i also tested it with all versions since 303 seems 303 is the last working version regarding this behavior just drop me a note if you need a downstripped example django app if you prefer a pull patch i could create one but as i wrote earlier my patch is merely a sympthomatic one with nearly no knowledge about the interna and possible side effects 
i m using django cms version 307 i m using these modules  i m using python 3 by the way to give you a better clue of what might go wrong the relative url is resolved by chrome v 39 v39 to http host admin cms page advanced 123advanced settings cms css cms toolbar sideframe css 
mkoistinen yakky is right this tool isquite simple and removing default language code from url i think url s are quite problematic in django cms it is a good idea to in the same step remove problem with 1 if you change url of existing page you will receive 404 error becouse system will not redirect you to the new address but stay at the same page which was pernamently moved 2 same like on st 1st point will give you 404 after page removal i think it should redirect you to main page 3 when you move page in a structure as a child of another page system is for a long time giving wrong url somewhere is stored old url 
fine so i put refactoring the view on my own todo list and make a pull request some time

hi czpython no problem thanks for getting back to me so quickly here are the settings  i ve tried downgrading django cms to 331 and still seem to run into the same problem so have reverted back to 332 as you can see from the settings i m also using a custom authentication app but can t see why this would affect this the site is not in production as i haven t developed anything yet outside of the authenticaion app so if you re having trouble replicating and have any experimental ideas for a solution happy to run on my end if that helps appreciate your help thanks

it works great with the carbon version thank you very much i can now develop good pdf on mac os 
the html displays perfectly and i don t get any errors at all if i go to the images in the brewer they all laid as well 
ok sorry for the late reply i don t get any notifications from github i will try the build and get back to you 
it doesn t work with file but it works with full path to html thank you 
let me explain the idea i built some programming framework that automatically generates c classes and their documentation in html such documentation leaves blanks to manually add notes later which come in html snippets that get rendered into the main page through iframes in the proper places as i have no previous idea of the content size of those snippets i cannot give them in the main automatically generated html an explicit height in advance so i wrote that java script javascript code to adjust their size when rendered the idea is to have those snippets included in the main html seamlessly as if they were all one thing 
because compression degraded the image quality in the pdf for certain images 
those one from your download page windows min gw mingw w 64 w64 bit 32bit compatible with xp 32 bit i need maximum compatibility i tried to run the converter under windows 7 64 bit also windows 7 32 bit d wkhtmltopdf bin wkhtmltopdf v wkhtmltopdf 01212 with patched qt ps i discovered that output is picture png not pdf but anyway it is broken 
are you asking me about the original image or the generated files 
yes it does the pn gs pngs are created using the canvas java script javascript method to data url todataurl and then saved using php note that there is supposed to be 0 transparency i am looking for a solid image 
try this gist https gist github com brenoferreira f f d a cc a 9f0619497f2d38a7cc1a here is the command output  i m not sure but it seems to be an issue with react but it would still be useful to know where exactly the error occurred 
yes it s working perfectly in 0121 i m actually using the combination of footer right and footer html to put a nicely styled html footer loaded from a local file and add page numbering using page and topage on top of that 
ok i saved the html page and used wkhtmltopdf to convert the page to pdf  here https github com prasadsurase wkhtmltopdf git 2301git is the url to the repository consisting the html page images css files and the pdf files created using the above commands

yes i attach the file please change extension from txt to html char txt https github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf files char 3955617char txt 
i have not yet been able to get to the alpha build i hope to try some time in the near future add my workaround is to pull the media print items into a new css file called last for html that will be converted to pdf that will do for the time being although eventually i d like to have the sections working properly so i don t have the extra css file

philter paper philterpaper thanks for the reference header spacing and footer spacing is a workable approach however the header line and footer line should generate the line based on the font size specified so that external calculation is not needed to determine the correct mm 
wk htm lto pdf wkhtmltopdf does not allow for multiple url or pages the website actually defines 1 html into 1 pdf i have been able to create a work around i save the each separate html webpage as a htm web page only file since i can define the file name i have the file name begin with a common grouping id like 0001 or 0123 etc 0001 bcbs jones br htm 20160510htm 0001 texas jones br htm 20160510htm after they are saved i use a command prompt to combine the files before i wk htm lto pdf wkhtmltopdf the file to pdf copy htm 0001htm 0001 jones br htm 20160510htm then i can run wk htm lto pdf wkhtmltopdf c 0001 jones br htm 20160510htm c 0001 jones br pdf 20160510pdf it is all scripted and is faster than i expected the combining of the 2 htm files take less than 1 minute for at least 300 files creating the pdf takes about 2 seconds each pdf the only issue i have is that the combination process does not have a page break between the different html files i do not know how to combine them to make sure there is a hard page break between files but it works thanks for your help patrick from philter paper philterpaper mailto notifications github com sent thursday may 12 2016 1020 am to wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf noreply github com cc patrick jarvis admin mypatientroster com author author noreply github com subject re wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf how to combine multiple htm ls htmls into 1 pdf 2928 doesn t wk htm lto pdf wkhtmltopdf allow you to specify multiple html input files to be output as a single pdf is that not what you re looking for  you are receiving this because you authored the thread reply to this email directly or view it on git hubhttps githubhttps github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf issues 2928 issuecomment 218790751
hello thanks for your reply this is the page i am trying to render http xoks net the wkhtmltopdf doesn t output the first line and displays the second line with an error everything else seems to be working this is the command line i am trying to run wkhtmltopdf encoding utf 8 http xoks net xoksnet pdf thank you one more time 
the cpu is an intel xeon it is much much better than the one on my laptop that is being used by the virtual machine i don t know if the gpu gets involved or not if there s no output going to a display i thought we d tack on a gpu just to see if it improved performance and it did not

reply is very late 
that was it i removed weight and worked yes it looks like so there s a bold version i didn t mind it was it because there was no problem with arial but now thinking about it i have an arial bold there thanks a lot 
thanks for your replies i believe it is something to do with the https delay however i have tried the javascript delay option which didn t help it is weird because when i run in terminal i can see the process takes a while to run compared to say outputting google com but it just appears that it is writing to pdf while the page is still loading i ve got around this by loading a http not https version of the pdf on the server and download that copy over https this means https integrity is intact but it doesn t answer the question of why using the https version of the report fails when the http version does not

alloylab wtf bro i have mentioned the version and also the specifics in the original post i m on ubuntu obviously using nginx don t think it matters whether i m on nginx or apache you simply just want to close issues without resolving them 
thanks for the help version update did solved the issue can you point me where i can download the latest executable of wkhtmltopdf thanks 
yes for example  width rem 20rem height rem 8rem 
that works thank you 
version 0124 os windows 7 the bug is present only when javascript changes page height on initialization in my small example attached there is 1 toc 2 home html inside link to index 32index htm under red icon 3 index 32index htm data page to reproduce the bug open result pdf and click on the red icon page 2 then you will jump to page 6 but not 3 but if you click on third toc link you will jump correctly to page 3 also please look inside index 32index htm here in onload init i change visibility of some blocks of text window print is called after all is finished and load jsdelay property is set to 10000 in generation jump bug zip https github com wkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf files jump 2494714jump bug zip 
note how to reproduce in the ticket it s wkhtmltopdf for all 3 cases win win mac win32win64mac please try them against that public site

well the copies option looks confused to me i really intend to produce a 10 identical pages into the pdf file this is due to my application need and thought the copies option is the right way to do so it would be nice if someone can clarify the expected behavior of this option many thanks best regards ryan chan sent from my i phone iphone
philter paper philterpaper thank you very much for the suggestion i believe you are suggesting some styling along the lines of below i tested a few different approaches to this understanding that this doesn t actually work out correctly when rendered in the browser i have tested this with the nuances of wkhtmltopdf unfortunately it results in the same issue of the checkboxes radio buttons being scaled down by the dpi setting doctype html html body h heading h1heading h 1 h1 p paragraph p br input type checkbox style font size px 72px checked label checkbox label br div style font size px 72px input type checkbox checked label checkbox label div br br input type checkbox style font size 300 checked label checkbox label br div style font size 300 input type checkbox checked label checkbox label div body html 
well it didn t segfault in 0124 so it must be something that was introduced in the last release i m compiling atm to try to find the commit that breaks it with bisect but qt compilation is taking a long time 
thank you for your solution what i did is that in the data source i count the number of pages and multiply for the page length like letter length having now the total of inches for my big pdf page regards 
ah thanks for the response though unfortunately the problem seems to be worse in the newer versions i tried it on alpha 0130alpha b 36694 7b36694 under windows 10 pro and the documents turned into these the header text is there in the first two images and is selectable it s just in white i made it purple in the third image so it is visible image https user images githubusercontent com cf eb aa e de a png 3750863461534545cf4eb880aa2711e98316985890de5a34png image https user images githubusercontent com d d aa e a dc png 3750863461534559d8d82080aa2711e982a915424dc21329png i altered the color of the header text so it is visible it is actually included in the document image https user images githubusercontent com f f aa e e ef f png 3750863461534973f3f76000aa2811e997e97ef798f43250png same code same command any specific version i should try next 
i want to disable particular tr on all the pages of my pdf except first page and those space need to be covered by next block tr rather than blank space 
right i ll put the blame on php for being retarded i still think the phpunit 3515 behavior was better thank you for looking up this issue
the problem is that specifying exception as the expected class is no longer accepted by php unit phpunit the reasoning is that doing so was getting tripped up by the exceptions that php unit phpunit itself throws for assertion failures skipped tests etc this would allow tests to catch exception a simple solution is to only accept subclasses if the expected exception isn t the root exception class this would solve all the problems and allow testing legacy code without the need for a special indicator that would be ideal 
sorry i didn t mean to close w o comment the team lead on our project narrowed it down to one particular test that causes this spike in resource usage even if it s the only test ran said test is extending symfony s symfony2s web test case webtestcase https github com symfony symfony blob master src symfony bundle framework bundle frameworkbundle test web test case webtestcase php so i suspect the problem lies there somewhere 
try these https github com mike php net pecl http v tree v2tree master phpunit
done https github com facebook hiphop php issues 688 however i think it belongs more to php unit phpunit than to hip hop if they try to fix everything they broke by incomplete compatibility they ll be tarpitted for millions man years on the other side i believe the developer who has whole mental picture of php unit phpunit class tree can pinpoint the faulty piece of framework magic just by reading the list of hiphop incompatibilities https github com facebook hiphop php blob master src doc inconsistencies

https github com sebastianbergmann phpunit mock objects issues 183
thanks sebastian and jeff for your quick reply i want to integrate this php unit phpunit with codeignitor and yes i am using the composer had already installed on my xampp could you please suggest some link which could be helpful me out 
i don t see them being used on any of the classes as for 38
hi thanks it works perfectly d keep up the good work cheers by the way why didn t my regular expression worked in php unit phpunit when i had tested it in several others sites and it did worked 
sure see https github com witte stier wittestier bmk server blob dev master module application test phpunit xml
php unit phpunit 4812 php deb 56141deb sury org trusty 1 with xdebug 232 then i call error log in the implementation
yes it would but you would also create a dependency from the comperator package to the full phpunit package which seems a little overkill 
i m trying to use php unit phpunit to test quite large application at work for obvious reasons i can t put it somewhere as a public repo i ll try to distill it to something usable but i m afraid it won t be possible it s a legacy application with structure totally unfit for testing what i was trying to write weren t even unit tests in the usual sense i need to set up lots of environment including databases and network etc so maybe php unit phpunit just isn t the tool for the job 
i m on osx yosemite dir resolves as vendor bin but that s correct because the files are in vendor bin phpunit vendor autoload php to resolve the issue in my project i added dir  autoload php to the array 
just rename php unit phpunit s internal testsuite small to directory pre lt testsuite name quot directory quot gt lt directory suffix quot test php quot gt tests framework lt directory gt lt directory suffix quot test php quot gt tests extensions lt directory gt lt directory suffix quot test php quot gt tests runner lt directory gt lt directory suffix quot test php quot gt tests util lt directory gt lt testsuite gt pre 
is this library compatible with symfony 30 since it requires some other libraries that require symfony components 
i am invoking in line command like this phpunit c tests phpunit xml  the project that i m writing is luiscoms release https github com luiscoms release 
the proposal of mock generator mockgenerator is to reduce many lines of mock creation in test class in order to maintain the test class more cohesively and readable example

omnibus is fine as it ships with 020 so i m guessing you d fixed it here https github com lamont granquist ffi yajl commit ee d a ff a e ea 80 ee07411d898a9641ff8904a67710658929e6ea80 probably just need to make sure we pin chef s gemspec to ffi yajl  020 and we d be good for weird people like me who might have installed chef by gem 
i manually changed it rebooted and i got the same message on win 2012
sounds reasonable once upon a time ish 2000ish there was some cms software that implemented this incorrectly but hopefully nobody does any more 
lamont granquist unfortunately it seems to give the same result where gulp still fails to run on my vm this issue seems unique to gulp as i can use the execute resource on other commands that involve and they work alright here s what my bash resource looks like 
since the chef resource package sets the timeout to 900 by default we should be able to just forward the timeout into the shell out for every package provider see that the windows provider is already having this construction have not focused on other providers for this btw just feel that it validates the most for the package providers you want me to create a pr for this 
so let me ask you do you guys get a webpage here http www opscode com chef download i get internal server error still 
ranjib thank you for the help this turns out to be an issue with the perimeter firewall for our vpc i am closing this at this time 
i agree to the longer fix i m unsure i m able to write it that said for the quick fix returning cwd instead of dir pwd i ll try to write it before leaving work now 
i upgraded chef server from chef server amd 64 11131amd64 to chef server co 12081 now it s working fine sometime i need to logout and login to see the updates 
jkeiser so the cookbook that is broken is https github com opscode cookbooks chef handler my guess is that there is something to do with the lwrp nature of resource 
thanks i m ok with that it will be useful for cases like mentioned in the top message of 4465

ubuntu 910 google chrome 503427 beta vimium 116
i think option 2 would be perfect 
i ve been thinking about this here are some ideas  have the option off by default prompt the user to switch to numbers when the option is selected  use a modifier key when selecting a hint character there is a bit of awkwardness with both methods i think both methods would benefit from a feature that is currently missing having the hint labels update accordingly when others are filtered away in the default scenario it s a lot nicer because i find myself doing something like this 1 narrow down to 14 links 2 press 14 on my keyboard to jump that link in the modifier key scenario it would be similar 1 narrow down to 14 links 2 press shift a to shift f to jump to that link using a modifier key also fixes an issue i had with vimperator i can t narrow down links with numbers in the link text food for thought
just get this error when he entered the plugin options i think it s because they do not read background page html
apologies i should have been clearer this happens with downloadable links for example go to http github com philc vimium downloads download one of the zip files using f or f notice after your download the link still has the focus on ie the little orange square around
osx 7051741
d oh rtfm i just read http github com philc vimium wiki editing the exclusion list dunno if the regex bit is new but i added to my gmail exclusions and i m golden now my exclusion list didn t change from the old to the new version and it worked fine before this might be an upgrade bug but is likely just pebkac 
i think vimperator has it but haven t used firefox in quite a while and b in vim works like b in vim not like the command t plugin b only tries to complete when you press tab while command t starts trying to match as soon as you type a character 
i am very sorry i was wrong 2011325 ilya reply reply github com

exactly thanks 
you re right
hi thanks for you reply when i went to the app manager of chrome i saw a warning which says that this app might be corrupted and there is a repair link beside i solved this issue by reinstall this extension you can close this issue now thanks again good job 
yes it is from the chrome store it only works on very few websites is this normal 
i think this might be related to something else going on in my chrome install i ve seen misbehavior in other plugins too specifically the plugin that re enables the backspace key to go back in history closing this for now since it s probably not a vimium bug thanks for the quick response 
yeah figured it out once the shell was being loaded it thought the iframe was at about blank i needed the following rule if that helps anyone 
after enabling and saving ignore keyboard layout the behavior did not change i know because my layout is completely different i use dvorak spanish it is odd because even with qwerty en the letter i was still not working all the others still work 
hi you can only replicate on the newly redesigned pages some users are opted in automatically but others may need to do so manually take a look at the top image here https imgur com a mc h tj d mch7tjd using j and k scrolls the background not the foreground post thanks
same problem occurs in sites like that actually i tried only in slack 1 1 https slack com 
it might very well be that the issue only appears if the stylesheet is loaded by another extension i haven t managed to create a simple example but using stylish on firefox with the my twitter dark style https userstyles org styles my 147945my twitter dark will have the effect i m describing on twitter com

sure i put everything i could get into the gist above if there s a better way to capture all of the output show in the windows command prompt than log txt let me know 
you can use j query jquery version 191

hi remy thanks for the quick reply so when i say publishing maybe i am not using the correct term i mean making edits to each page and making it live as i had done previously what i am trying to say is when i go in now and make revisions to the pages those changes don t apply when i pull up the site on my mobile device the mobile version of the website i ve been working on is http www yvesculptor com on the index page of that site i inserted code to redirect to the js bin jsbin mobile version of the site hope this make sense now here are a couple pages from the site does this help https jsbin com lufijo 9 https jsbin com netoxu 7 i just don t know what i need to do specifically in js bin to make the changes reflect when users go to http www yvesculptor com and the mobile version comes up thx andre thxandre adams from remy sharp notifications github com to jsbin jsbin jsbin noreply github com cc andreadams 1974 andreadams1974 andreadams yahoo andreadams1974yahoo com sent wednesday october 14 2015 534 am subject re jsbin yvesculptor com mobile not working  2580 just to clarify the terms didn t change they were added at the same time pro was launched so these haven t changed since you upgraded to pro looking at your username i can see that your first bin was created on jan 10jan 2014 that isn t to say you didn t use the site before but under your current pro account this is the first bin regarding publishing i m not sure what you re referring to can you clarify there s never been a publish button on jsbin except to publish to your vanity page which again was introduced with pro can you give me the url of the bin you re trying to archive that might yield some clues reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github 
hmm it is a problem because i can t stable repeat it i can give you a link http jsbin com qidosap edit 43edit html js output that working good in private mode in chrome and sometimes working in normal mode for me now i opened the app and do not see anything in the output window i push the run with js button and nothing happens the same in safari on my os x in private mode in chrome all is working good 
ok thanks for that the thing that really mystifies me is that it works fine on jsbin com but the same code doesn t work the same for me is there any specific server config that s needed 
it has fixed i had to make the cache empty 
when i removed all cookies and reloaded the page login with git hub github worked as usual i don t know what caused it but the fix was easy enough thanks remy

i had 102 installed and i have vs commands 2010 vscommands2010 installed i recently updated to 103 and have not had the issue but i have had the issue for a while although it sporadic and will happen all at once having to restart vs multiple times because every time i start up and attempt to close some windows it crashes one thought i ve had is my machine can be rather slow at times and there is a synchronization issue going on i m moving faster than vs can keep up with the only thing that makes me think that this is a vs vim vsvim issue is that it only happens when i have it enabled on fri jul 29 2011 at 901 am jaredpar reply reply github com wrote

hi jared thanks for quick response i ll post my output from set below but first i think you may be missing something you are correct that the arrows keys should extend the selection but only if the shift key is down and both gvim and vsvim do correctly handle extending the selection in both select and visual mode when arrow keys are used with shift down but when the shift is not down the arrow keys should always take you out of select mode that conforms to expected windows behavior in gvim both in select and visual mode if i press an arrow key without shift i escape from select visual mode and the cursor moves but vsvim behaves incorrectly when arrow keys are used without shift in select visual mode  in visual mode it extends the selection in select mode nothing happens it s totally stuck here is my output from set in case you still need it diffexpr my diff mydiff history 50 ruler noswapfile nowrap encoding utf 8 hlsearch scroll 19 tabstop 4 nowritebackup helplang en incsearch shiftwidth 4 ttyfast backspace indent eol start diffopt filler vertical fileencodings ucs bom utf latin 1 8latin1 keymodel startsel stopsel selection exclusive selectmode mouse key whichwrap b s

virtualedit all is my default choice for vim combines insert and block options having it in vs vim vsvim will be great without dividing it into rarely used insert block variants i mentioned virtualedit block as an alternative possible easier one in implementation because it resolves the most common and annoying problem i have https 1https f cloud github com assets b c fae 192643011340467b1c2fae be e d a c b png 1be911e39406d6a67c607b04png having cursor at 1 i start visual block after pressing j l 3j3l i get 2 but expect 3 btw i found out that pressing j 3j or j 3j leads to one more variation provided by vim 4
right however i like tab shift tab a bit more because tab shift tab maintains the selection so that you can press tab shift tab continuously to adjust the indention the column mode does not work like native e g with alt shift up down edit line up extend column lineupextendcolumn edit line down extend column linedownextendcolumn command vs 2012 vs2012 vsvim manage to enter a visual mode similar to vs s column mode but they are quite different as i see it vs s column mode allows continuous deletion and insertion while vim s visual mode can not i thought this is an known intended behavior besides the above two the only other difference i can find is the cursor so you ve done really good job to maintain the compatibility but isn t a listen to esc only insert mode easier to implement and completely native just my 2 cents maybe that s a bad idea i m not sure 
sorry i wanted to update earlier but couldn t 
ctrl r ctrl w the word under the cursor ctrl r ctrl a the word under the cursor see word in all other mode i prefer resharper action by ctrl r
it doesn t show up in vs 2012 either it does show up in vs 2010 though 
i used a swedish keyboard to type those characters but the alt number method has the same result for example is typed as shift 4 and is typed using the key left of the 1 key

yes if you change the enum keyword to class and remove type type 1 type1type1 then highlight is still disappearing in my real class where i initially observed this bug this enum is actually nested in outer class and this bug eats highlighting in the whole class but only above the line which you click after you click 1 there is always this  and yes it is not always the case but with bigger file this is much often than with this small example files and to fix the highlighting almost always you need to click somewhere upper the 1 usually the class name when highlighting is broken but only until you click somewhere below again but not always 
i suppose this one is quite specific to our use case i ve been trying to solve this by using bytebuddy and the interface listed above the idea is to have an instant dirty tracking object without having implement any of the setters to catch changed values 
if you mean to do this by comparing parameter types to check whether the same method signature https docs oracle com javase specs jls se html se7html jls html 8html jls 842 exists i agree that s a better idea i think the same however can be said about getter  setter  wither

maaartinus right now i m working with an api wrapped native library that expects one to call close to clean up native resources while it shouldn t happen that a close is forgotten i m using cleaner s to ensure that anything that might have been leaked gets cleaned up when its corresponding object gets collected 
maaartinus i wrote the ticket so that others can find it should they face the same issue i don t think that someone needs to spend time on a fix for this if someone really wants to improve the installer for this use case i d solve this by adding a combobox in the installer where you have to select your ide before you open the file selection dialog so that you can force the user to select the ini file instead of a folder if eclipse was selected earlier

thanks for the instructions and yes i d like to submit a pr for it just to be clear and fair issue was initially reported and patched by gkalpak on angular js repo it just happened that i bumped into it at the same time and tried to share the load 
curently if we have to detach a collection and remembering where each element was i suppose we have to write something like  and i was thinking maybe j query jquery can propose a shortcut to do it faster there are at least two advantages to use something like reattach  cancelling a drag  the possibility to accelerate some changes with jq collection jqcollection detach code reattach 
i thought that this was the default behavior because the following script returns the instance itself for example  also i think that the function fn each is not fully documented sometimes i use it to iterate over a collection of items not necessarily over a j query jquery object sorry for my english 
we tried before but ended up getting stack overflows in ie 8 ie8 at the time july 2014 we went from 191 but using x 111x crashed in ie 8 ie8 1102 worked fine

mzgol you can use require with electron it s a quirk of our build deployment system which caters for both web and desktop which makes require ing jquery less than ideal for us 
thank you 
i believe the solution could be simple i just would remove the src selector js and leave the src selector sizzle if the guy wants to use the sizzle he does so app js with sizzle  totally modular and optional

gibson 042 gibson042 yeah just wanted to confirm that there wasn t reasoning behind the current setup 
i ve removed everything that s unnecessary regarding the j query jquery version you may have thought it s 191 because you saw the jquery js 191js file that wasn t being used and has since been deleted as well 
this is a normal html 5 html5 page the problem is that the code does not break in any other browser and the error only appears inside the mentioned j query jquery function without any reference to specific js or div that might fail in what cases is compute style tests computestyletests normally applied maybe that could help to figure out to which js or div it refers following the msdn library https msdn microsoft com en us library h awd v h62awd6328v vs aspx 9429aspx in the console refers to the following problem object expected you attempted to invoke a method or property on an object of a type other than object or you passed an argument of a type other than object when an object was required 
the element in a fragment still has an inherent visibility wherein were it to be appended to the body and nothing existing in the body etc were to be otherwise changing the visibility of that element then that element either would or would not be visible in other words span text i am visible hide text and now i m not in any case that seems an already decided question var foo div foo hide foo show foo toggle all work no errors problem is hide show and all three toggle work when we re not dealing with an array of j query jquery objects hide and show both work on an array of passed elements but toggle throws an error var foo div foo hide  no errors works foo show  no errors works foo toggle  error

thank you dave i have not been able to test that i tried to look at the source code in j query jquery but it went above my head i guess i am not sure how to do this and at what level i should expect j query jquery to abstract browser s behavior 
i set the disabled property on some links out of habit since it works on buttons only afterwards did i realize that it shouldn t disable the click handler since the property is not supported on links this is certainly not a critical issue for me i just make it a habit to report potential bugs to open source projects that i use 
you re right this issue comes from another component datatable net https datatables net i m still looking how to fix it thanks

ok let s say you have 2 views in your app one main view listing tweets one user view when you see a user profile both have 100 images loaded when the user goes back from the user profile view to the main view you want to release those 100 images you loaded as you won t need them anymore with your commit that profile view needs to keep all those image url in a ns array nsarray and call remove image for key removeimageforkey 100 times i want to do neither of them if sd image cache sdimagecache cache mem cache memcache was a dictionary of dictionaries per cache key cachekey cache key cachekey being set to default if unspecified and i had methods like set image with url setimagewithurl placeholder image placeholderimage for cache key forcachekey clear cachefor key clearcacheforkey i could  request to fetch an image using a cache key cachekey which would be different for the master and the profile view  clear that cache when the profile view unload in a single step without storing the ns images nsimages i ve loaded in that view 
like this  import sd web image sdwebimage ui image view uiimageview web cache webcache h 
no i did not it was more convenient for us to add your project as git submodule so i just added subproject in xcode and linked static lib to my target 
so i don t need the result block to be called on main thread in my case i do some processing on images after cache and usually put cached image on another queue just for that but now that i think of it i could probably save cached image pre processed 
this is my definition property nonatomic assign id sd web image operation sdwebimageoperation operation 
can it be i will test immediately how can i set that 
the culprit seems to be self cancel block cancelblock nil line 271 of sd web image combined operation sdwebimagecombinedoperation it happens only sporadically so i ll have to find a way to make it happen again so i get the stack trace 
no sorry i have no solution i think the i os ios need the x 2x prefix 
good now can build at xcode 6 xcode6 with no errors
it does work now because i am not using google maps
background image will be floating means it would be moving have you understand the problem 
my image sizes are around 100 kb each

sorry i m mistake my company s server is bad now i will close the issue 
zhongwuzw i did try the sd web image scale down large images sdwebimagescaledownlargeimages option when trying to address this issue but i still got the crash  the only thing i didn t try was the option to not decompress images on download but i figured in this case it would just move the problem to when the image is being displayed dreampiggy yeah i found this to be a very frustrating crash to duplicate since it was only by random luck that one of my co workers has an xs max that he tested on the crash did not show up in the simulator but i assume that s because the simulator has access to the resources of the machine on which its running i wish xcode had a way to simulate a specific memory load condition e g 5 ram available etc i have not tested it on the regular xs the xr or even the 8 because no one in our office has those models 
i ve tried 446 but still crash

indeed thanks somehow didn t spot this 
there are probably two separate issues here 1 in the general case ignoring my desires to find where a profile came from allowing builtin profiles to occur in profiles d is error prone and not very useful the purpose of profiles d seems to be to make it easier to install profiles by dropping them into a directory this is great for custom profiles however the merge strategy is to error if a profile exists in more than one source so it would be a bad idea to put builtin profiles like user in profiles d because then anyone following standard practice to install plugins by editing profiles clj will be met by errors and they ll need to know to how to fix the problem by trawling through profiles d looking for the duplicate definition and moving the declarations into one file or the other this is the sort of thing that profiles d was trying to prevent but for builtin profiles it could end up making things worse so for this reason i think we should disallow built in profiles from profiles d 2 i specifically would like to be able to find the user profile containing user so that my windows leiningen installer can modify the file to update the java cmd definition to point to the user s preferred jdk this isn t impossible as is but it would be easier if i didn t have to parse every file under profiles d to look for the definition especially when defining built ins in profiles d seems to be a bad idea to begin with given the error on merge strategy putting each profile in its own file seems a good idea as it guarantees that no merge errors can occur between profiles d files and makes managing them easier 
thanks starting with a clean slate made all the difference i think it was a case of self sabotage i get into stuff i don t understand just enough so that when i start to know what to do i ve already tweaked things against myself thanks a ton hopefully i m a quicker study with clojure and clojurescript than i have been with getting things to this point emacs is looking cool i m wanting to try clojurescriptone as well this is awesome you are awesome this made my day 
this fixes my issue i recommend instead you move the gc into the beginning of the clean target instead of calling it with every file in the recursive loop 
i just tried it with the latest leiningen from head and i can t reproduce it now good stuff i mainly created the issue to document the strange failed to collect dependencies for clojure lang lazy seq lazyseq e 68 35732e68 exception in case others hit a similar thing 
afaik i don t see any problems with this tried it out in xp removed reply from project clj from the leiningen checkout and included it in the default profile map as a plugin built leiningen moved it to self installs and tried a repl this worked what about trptcolin

hy pi rion hypirion a more descriptive error message sounds reasonable to me especially since the files being maps is part of their contract technomancy agreed i had entertained the possibility of it not being an error because it s arguable that an empty file should be interpreted as nil but i decided against it because even if it did evaluate to nil instead of throwing a runtime exception runtimeexception it still wouldn t satisfy leiningen s profile expectations

steps to reproduce 
 unset lein java cmd echo lein java cmd lein leiningen is a tool for working with clojure projects several tasks are available  cool thanks any idea why 
actually i d like to get clojure into the community driven effort for data science clojure is often used in data science and so is python  julia java and r so instead of treating each language as an island there s a language agnostic and platform agnostic package manager called conda https conda io docs which is an initiative from anaconda https www anaconda com what is anaconda think of brew but completely cross platform and it creates isolated environments for installed software which can t interfere with each other the main advantage is that it s result of push towards reproducible research and analysis i think that clojure community would greatly benefit from conda conda forge like bio conda is an entirely community driven effort towards this goal trouble is i need help regarding setting up the package once here s the current error and you can read more here https circleci com gh conda forge staged recipes utm 19950utm campaign vcs integration link utm medium referral utm source github build link
perfect workaround walterl way better than my add lein file to repo and add one additional space cheers 
for an arbitrary model you can generate a pretty dag provided that pydot is installed m pymc mcmc my model pymc graph dag m see the user s guide for details but there s not much else to it 
well there is already a variable function that behaves like a constructor i suppose strictly speaking the method for adding them to the model should be add var and add data but the former actually returns a variable object tensor i do not know what is cleaner 
i like that idea its analogous to what matplotlib s savefig does for saving figures inferring the type from the filename 
fixed in the above pr 
tried this earlier by using only inflation variable didn t help however i don t actually need the month to be a random variable so i removed it and the model works after that so it is definitely something to do with interaction of indexing by a random variable error in draw samples was to do with trying to get a model parameter from tensor constant tensorconstant that seemed to contain the contents of the month variable not sure why it is a constant 
i suspect that pip installing pandas caused me to update numpy using pip i ve heard that this isn t bulletproof i suspect that running off of a newer epd distribution would work i m curious what do the pymc developers use 
i got the dmg from http gcc gnu org wiki g fortran binaries gfortranbinaries mac os macos i chose 482 for os x mavericks 109 when i tried to install gfortran os x always complained the file is from unidentified developer i had to force open and run it 
i tried to install from the pymc 23 at https pypi python org pypi pymc but it is for version 27 of python and not version 33 it gives me an error since it can t find a reference to version 27 in the registry 
aha thanks for the pointer it seemed that something went wrong with uninstalling the former before installing the latter so i uninstalled both versions carefully removing any trace in the site packages folder and then reinstalled py mc pymc 22 the version provided by canopy now it works 
thanks for the witch response and great package i have replicated the issue on 3 machines they are all running the same rhel x 5x image using an up to date anaconda install i can give you an example of the actual observed data tomorrow though i am very skeptical that it is the particular data the machine isn t under heavy load when i run it it is iterating through a file and running this analysis many times so it is the same data each time when i observe one example running slowly like this all of them will or at least the 510 i had the patience to wait through will if i kill and restart it it may switch state to the quick running state and blast through the analyses let me know what other information i can provide and i ll do my best to provide it on aug 25 2014 535 pm chris fonnesbeck notifications github com wrote

here we go i noticed that the installer does not find atlas although it is present but since it comes only as a warning i guess that should not be the reason btw in the meantime i have cleaned my install completelly by hand and reinstalled with pip i got 233 and the problem with the data out of their support range was no longer seen tried some 10 times the import error is still there when i try to install from git 
sorry i couldn t replicate the issue with a simple example going back and forth between my real and example scripts the issue seemed to be be related to scope in my script which had the issue pm sample was called in a function within a function the issue was probably related to my poor coding than pymc 
i haven t found a way to define a density dist densitydist such that it ll be a joint distribution of more than one variable if that is possible it would be great but all the examples i ve seen that use density dist densitydist are for a single input how do i make pymc 3 pymc3 recognise that i m defining density dest densitydest over both x and y if i use density dist to refer to the f x f2x y function e g with model section instead has  apologies i should have posted all the things i had tried previously the issue is that i don t know how to get pymc 3 pymc3 using density dist densitydist or otherwise to work when the logprobability is a function of two or more variables i e in a more complicated case we re unsure how to separate the two variables but know how to define their joint pdf and we want to be performing inference on the values of those two variables is there some way to tell density dist densitydist that the input size is 2 or more 
jsalvatier i am definitely willing to contribute however given that my first experience with py mc pymc was two days ago looks very cool btw i am not sure of how much help i can be until i familiarize myself a bit more with the codebase i will look into it
as an exercise i just rebuilt my environment in python 35 with fresh packages from py pi pypi then latest theano and pymc 3 pymc3 from github and problem has gone away for now i am going to assume this is some weirdness with my environment and will hopefully go back and investigate in 34
if i set random seed 0 for both calls to sample i get the same behavior the second trace starts in a different spot or if i just set the seed in the first call and don t set it for the second is there something else i should try this may be a nave question but does that mean i m sunk mcmc isn t going to work on this model i was initializing nuts with advi based on what i saw in other discussions here  if i just call pymc sample pymc3sample it assigns nuts to the variables takes a while to initialize i think and then sampling stalled at the th 6th iteration 
i tried deleting theano and various other means of blowing in the cartridge restarting my computer reinstalling pmyc 3 pmyc3 and am still getting 10 what s more a colleague sitting next to me is getting the same result we re working from a virtualenv here are the versions of possibly relevant packages 
it works with rc 2 30rc2 sorry about that i thought i was on the most up to date version because i ran pip install pymc 3 pymc3 upgrade but that left me on 30 to get rc 2 30rc2 i had to pip uninstall pymc 3 pymc3 and then reinstall 
i ve tried pip install git https github com pymc devs pymc git pymc3git again still the same error

yes upgrading to 32 sorry about that removes the error but i think that s because no diverging steps are now produced on my models during warmup despite my best efforts well done pymc 3 pymc3 team i still think the nuts py single step code as it exists currently on github is wrong but your comment shows that you are on to this 
yes i tested it it works
oh true we can add cov white noise whitenoise e 1e 4 when we setup the cov function in that case this option seems not very necessary thanks 
hi ericmjl thanks for the response to clarify i only pip installed from git hub github while troubleshooting this since i was no longer able to install from py pi pypi it seems like this was an issue with cache i had for py mc 3 pymc3 pip installing with no cache dir worked but i still had issues with pip stalling for other purposes until i cleared out my cache i guess it was just a coincidence that it was consistently an issue with py mc 3 pymc3 this can be closed 
actually i ve just also found another issue on https docs pymc io notebooks smc gaussians smc2gaussians html maybe we can combine these issues into the same pr img width 1196 alt image src https user images githubusercontent com ddf da ea 1214890707967635ddf20001da311ea c f ad e png 90c70517f3ad31e4png aloctavodia yeah i might have time to do it during this or next weekend 
done this is my first pull request to a shared project 
hi ken ichi thanks for the quick reply 1 regarding indication i was thinking more along the lines of adding a red asterisk to show that a field is required right now when a custom field is required it is marked with a red asterisk when non custom field is required no indication whatsoever 2 when directly adding an observation from the project page 21 user clicks add observation on project page 23 user does not fulfill requirements 24 observation is saved but not added to project link shown to edit project 25 user edits project to fulfil requirements 26 but upon saving the observation is not added to the project so i was thinking of maybe keeping the users within the project somehow so they don t have to manually add the observation to the project upon fulfilling a requirement 
i meant the custom observation fields i e user would be able to create fields that accept multiple items via checkboxes

ah ha i see what you mean i don t have strong feelings about how it is resolved if the end result is expected behavior of ci ds cids i e going to the finest level of agreement 
pleary this looks great one minor thing and if it s time consuming we can forget about it it would fabulous if the labels vertically lined up with the icons the labels are slightly too high on all browsers so hopefully that means no customization for certain browsers chrome image https cloud githubusercontent com assets eb d ea e aff 1152799413763506eb181d00ea0311e59aff b ed f png 05b162ed94f9png ff image https cloud githubusercontent com assets f ff d ea e f c e f cec png 1152799413763511f02ff7d6ea0311e59f37c4e9f51cec27png safari image https cloud githubusercontent com assets fdb c 1152799413763519fdb0859c ea e a c aeaaa png ea0311e58a23c7106aeaaa42png i fiddled with it in the web dev tools and couldn t get it right so it really may be something difficult i think ken ichi has mentioned something about icons and labels being tricky anyways if it s something that would take longer than min 5min no worries thanks for taking care of this 
reeeahheeheeelly oh jeez i never noticed that it would be nice if the i ds ids got an id icon and mentions and comments got the speech bubble however if that s a huge pain i d say we just get rid of them

looking good on brave 
no it s working now 
the first presentation will be on th 29th july 
right i install libreadline by homebrew and if ld first it could be found 
apparently this is due to the fact that moarvm is being compiled with a version of glibc that is more modern than what s available in the default repositories is that correct also maybe i should move this issue to moar vm moarvm 
the leak may have slowed but has not been eliminated 
in the actual code i m destructuring a homogeneous array of strings to properly typed variables so one would have to do something like  which is a bit er eugh to my eye but it works 
looks good 
i discovered the zef nuke store dir storedir temp dir tempdir command and after using that i was able to do a successful zef install text csv so maybe just a corrupted download i thought i had deleted the old source download before when looking at the problem i guess i was wrong sorry about that 
liznat that sounds great rebuilding to test now 
i don t think 2020021 has the problem as you can see from the expected behavior section 2020021 works fine what i think has the problem is version 202005 which doesn t have a precompiled offical version yet 
i think the better way to explain it is the following in template php s get attribute getattribute method you first check for the given property existing and then you check for a method existing by the same name then if call is one of the object s methods you use that what you should be doing is first checking to see if get is a callable method and using that first unless you re explicitly calling a method by using does this make sense i ll submit a patch

sure note as i type this i realize this may be a long winded answer i apologize ahead of time i still think the idea has merit  summary of what yaml frontmatter is http wiki github com mojombo jekyll yaml front matter from the jekyll project  rapid development i see twig as a huge step in outsourcing the process of template development to a front end team that has html css and js expertise but may not be as comfortable with php this could also include services like psd html psd2html and xhtm lized xhtmlized   the app in a typical template dev scenario a person or team is given design mockups and then it is their responsibility to turn those mockups into web pages in this scenario a php team could set up a sandboxed environment that functions as a template development app inside this app is where the template folks would build the html using twig   fixtures that s fine but what if the site is very data driven it would be great to have the template dev team take care of building the for loops et cetera that loop through and display the data but they can t do that if there s no fake data think fixtures for them work with you don t really need a full fledged sql database to handle this task yaml is a very good option in this scenario a list of yaml fixtures could be kept in separate files and put into the context as data when the template was rendered as long as they were told how the data was structured and where they could get it the template dev team could build twig templates that could be hooked up to a real sql database later on without much fuss   more flexibility for very agile teams this is not enough for most sites driven by a content management system there is a set data structure say in my sql mysql addressed above but the system is expected to be flexible enough to handle arbitrary data on a per template or per page basis we see this implemented in a lot of systems like this custom fields in word press wordpress is a good example it is typical in a lot of small companies that the web designer becomes the template developer as well it is also typical that these folks do not have extensive sql experience and they shouldn t have to their job is information design as a part of the creative process why not let the designer create and develop new elements on the fly your designer is familiar with yaml from examining the yaml fixtures you created earlier and let s face it yaml is easy to figure out   example let s say that on the home template on the site it is now desirable to have a slideshow that has five large images each with a caption and short description using twig and yaml frontmatter the designer could define the data structure and start building the functionality immediately using a template similar to this home html  with the right images and css in place the prototype is done and the designer didn t have to know anything about sql tables migrations or anything else the advantage is agile and rapid development with yaml frontmatter the prototype is built now there can be a discussion on how to make this prototype a real feature by porting to a sql or no sql nosql database or whatever hope that explanation helps

oh i missed that one thanks for the heads up 
this is the script php
my routing is prefixed with language code e g en my path in app config routing yml i have because i have it in a couple of places in templates by i would like to be able to create macros like that in the future and use them for various purposes if returned type is not string what type is it  why it s not good to use marcos as functions that returns a value 
about bom http en wikipedia org wiki byte order mark i think lots of noobs with twig like me will have the same problem and they will not know how to fix it i had to edit parser php and replace some code to understand the real problem 
yes this is right it s for symfony 2 symfony2 i ll re create the bug there 
sorry you re correct there is a problem in framework i use not in the twig 
heah dude heahdude i really do mean blocks as defined by the block http twig sensiolabs org doc tags block html here https github com sonata project dev kit issues 205 is the related issue that show why i need that we have a bundle with a block named example and it has been decided that blocks should be namespaced so that there is no risk of collision when inheriting from our templates that means i would like to deprecate the example block in favor of a sonata randombundle example block fabpot big difference indeed i get it now i m closing this then 
ok do you mean that i can just call static methods of any classes without even mentioning about them to twig instance 
this is simply to remove this 2 lines and consequently the indentation created by them  a solution could be to not have a block content but a special variable child content including the child without extends and in this case the boolean option for the block would be always usefull this option could be too usefull in a debug context if you want not see a special block just adding a false would be a speedly solution than comment an entire block to respond to your question more precisily the birth of this idea is in symfony my solution for the moment is a personal bundle which rewrite the content at the end like the profiler and apply a layout in fact my solution is maybe good but just one layout isn t enought and make the tests necessaries to define layout in a proper way make me affraid where how on what as i want to be more close to symfony standard i search a solution in twig but if i can i would prefer to not rewrite all forms with a content block 
sure i just made these simple ones for a quick test and exception happens on version 18 base html
app is too complex to isolate but i think than crash is caused by exception in thrown in get it might be also relevant to sandbox 1254

no that doesn t really help my point here is that the information in the documentation is incomplete i do understand how it works 
there we go so normally all the projects that i m involved i have a lot of java script javascript and js comments inserted in to the twig layouts also normally i m calling a block which is in the top of the page i don t like to put js code in the middle of the page the thing is that i would like to parse all this js code to remove the comments i don t want to show the comments to the user for example  what i was using temporally were twig comments   but then they could break my code because they are removing the n line that s why my last issue i wanted to check the template engines for python or ror to find a example i m sure that they have this feature implemented unfortunately i don t have enough time cheers 
brandonkelly i thought that already happened 
well basically my goal is to have  or any other enclosing characters behave in different predefined ways so as to simplify a designer s work who doesn t have to know about expressions filters operators etc if i can have text behave as an alias of text uppercase then it d allow me to extend the language to my liking and broaden how i use twig smiley is there any way of doing this i take it i might have to extend the lexer and or tokens i ve barely browsed over the code to understand it fully heh

sure i am testing in  1231 but this problem has existed for at least a year   index php as you schoid be able to see the error is reported as being in index html twig rather than in content html twig the diff i supplied above resolves the issue 
the lib provide his how class i decide to parse data coming directly from database so went i fetch data from database i one time do this  but went rendering it returns me html tags instead parsing which i expecte 
in fos user bundle fosuserbundle in resources views layout html twig there is just the full html like and then in my symfony installation in app resources i create a fos user bundle fosuserbundle views layout html twig with one only line extends fos user bundle fosuserbundle layout html twig  that should work right 
mmmh not exactly i have 3 applications webapp admin api which sends emails located in the same place on the same server each one having a specific vhost but sharing the same common code models libs  including the twig management class the twig management class uses the twig loader filesystem to provide twig with places to search for templates here is the ctor code if it can help understand better how the application is architectured  as i said i could rename for example admin view layout twig in admin view layout admin twig in order to have unique filenames but then i d have to change every place where this file is extended no big deal of course but i d have preferred not to have to do it and to have an option to use the old algorithm instead which takes subfolder into account for computing the cache file name key best regards 
fabpot will do a few more tests my end as just entering a integer it works fine but when being passed from my object it fails 
probably the simplest way to recreate this issue is to try with the actual project so in your webroot  then point your browser at grav twig 2 twig2 i ve already made some fixes in this branch but this one issue i just can t seem to understand you will see the error is coming from the assets css  call you can then follow my first comment and see how the renaming of the method works etc the assets class in question is in system src grav common assets php also after going back to twig 130 thinks start working again thanks fabien 
ah yip that fixes it apologies i should ve searched through the closed issues 
yes i noted that regading use case i was thinking in something like this in templates  each of those tag could have some logic behing to use with attributes given or just print atributes as per se a template will be used also for rendering such component this is why i though on having twig lexer and twig parser extended and also adding later twig node as needed it did look more natural to me to have it available for configuration later on on twig and take advantage of twig api for it about your suggestion on using pre processor i havent read about it yet unfortunately so i can not tell how far can i get with it could you please provide me some resources to chew 
xabbuh i don t think that ignoring errors in production is good idea for example because of this some important information won t be displayed to the user and there won t be anything in error log it would be better if the user saw that there is an error and the developer saw the message in the log and fix the bug rather than the user saw imprecise information also a search engine can index the page with missing information for example an article page without content displayed and this can hurt seo ranking but if there were a 503 error page the search bot would not index it and visit the page later stof i think that debug is another variable it controls whether the template object can be dumped or something like this and i think it is better to keep those two variables separate

does twig fiddle twigfiddle also compile the code before execution in exactly the same way as symfony does i can t reproduce the error on twig fiddle twigfiddle even though i make the code an exact match of what i use in symfony as you ll notice from the original post the error occurs in the compiled code in the var cache dev folder of symfony

standard css inline for the obvious performance reasons plenty of literature on that https www smashingmagazine com understanding 201508understanding critical css 
it s because we are expecting twig to ignore us when we provide a null in the place of a node in the twig node node construct ie something like  we ve refactored the code in x 87x and up to not do this but that fix never made it back to x 86x because it was not a bugfix

thanks for the solution i changed it to double shift and it worked then back to single and it stopped again switching it from control then back to shift did the trick all is working now 
version 115 was the version i allowed quicksilver to update to how do i roll back to 111
i am running version 10 i don t see an upgrade button anywhere does quicksilver have updating functionality yet unfortunately it doesn t look like i can recreate the crash 
thanks for the response yes the problem persists after restart i ve just figured out that it only happens for certain types of compound commands i can save a command to display test in large type but i can t save one from show all menus safari email this page it goes through the motions as if it will create a qscommand file but none appears is it possible it doesn t like working with proxy objects for this console showed this error when qs failed to save a qscommand quicksilver 18535 script suite scriptsuite warning for result type of command get direct types getdirecttypes in suite quicksilver handlers quicksilverhandlers list is not a valid type name 
yes it is checked though i never look for ur ls urls mostly just other files apps that have similar names i ve unchecked it and will see what happens i have submitted numerous crash reports though more recently i ve been getting tired writing detailed comments of the same issue

good question just tried it out open just directly opens the document but open a finder works correctly admittedly it s an extremely low priority thing there s probably just about nobody who actually uses the stationery pad feature and i tested it opening the document in pages for i os ios too and it also just straight up opens it rather than making a copy most likely the stationery pad feature is just vestigial and forgotten

quicksilver is behaving at the moment i ll keep activity monitor open and see if i can catch it in the act i m not sure if i skipped over x 12x or not the main thing i remember from the release notes is that the smart spacebar functionality was added i update it whenever it asks this was the first update in quite a while over a year i m currently on 130
thanks for the quick response it s not related to any specific query every quicksilver activation causes a crash whether i search for anything or not in fact it s impossible to keep it running long enough to deactivate spotlight actually it s impossible to keep it running period if i launch it and wait a few seconds it crashes i m very sorry i m unable to give you more useful information than that is there a way to disable spotlight in quicksilver without launching quicksilver i m happy to edit a plist file or run a defaults write command whatever it takes i know my way around the console and i m unafraid of diving in i was persistent i managed to move fast enough to go to catalog custom spotlight and disable it and now i am able to use quicksilver again spoke too soon it crashed again but i was able to keep it alive long enough to find and disable plugins spotlight smart folders and plugins spotlight comment tags it s been alive for 5 minutes or so now and i ll await further instructions thanks again

thanks 
the ability to namespace i e prefix remote repositories would be nice gh for github gt for gitorious goc for git or cz etc 
snaewe that may work for basic cloning but what about p mislav why not read a configuration option from git config hub protocol 
neither
i just want to do something like git pull user fork branch
since last night not prior to last night when attempting to send a pull request and attach to an issue eg where 52 is a valid open issue origin is a valid repo and dev is a valid branch issue 52 is 14 commits ahead of origin dev and issue 52 has been pushed to my repo this has been occuring for 2 different repositories that i ve previously used hub with since last night with the same previously working configuration i suppose you could reproduce it unless this is only affecting the repos i m touching by attempting to attach a pull request to an issue via hub 
oh i guess i typed the wrong branch name 
an organization administration could delete the repo it looks like it s indeed the issue you referenced 
no can t i attach pull request to an existing issue that i don t own 
it sounds like a tool for hub to me my example was just a use scenario it s my understanding that hub is a program for integrating github into git which i believe this would fall under a quick skim over the api doesn t seem to show that it is currently included but i think it is something that will be i ll throw in an api suggestion to the git hub github guys as well 
since i have push default set to current or also simple git push will always push feature branch to origin feature branch regardless of what branch it is tracking the tracking branch only applies when using git pull or when using git push if push default is set to upstream

mislav btw the team is not required to set when creating the repo via github com so perhaps this is a mistake in the api 
that s a good question something i don t have an answer to unfortunately maybe there isn t a solution at this time and pat is the only way this was more of a wish hope that someone else knows something i don t 
fmapfmapfmap https github com fmapfmapfmap is an organisation which i ve permission to create new repositories in another case to consider if a user has multiple keys and those keys permit creating new repositories under different user accounts specifying which account to fork the original project to i m not sure if that s compatible with the existing authentication mechanism 
i ve installed hub using homebrew http brew sh the bash auto complete script used on linux and osx is the same here is osx result of hub tab you can scroll right  since pressing tab does something then i guess hub auto complete script works however it appears that none of hub specific commands are displayed i can see all my custom aliases though e g rbm st the bash autocompletion engine was installed by homebrew as well 
bingo mislav i also noticed ssh github com in the remotes but didn t know to look in ssh config now looking at ssh config at first i thought this test mac just had stale dotfiles but then i found https help github com articles using ssh over the https port  probably worth working to support this but on the surface doesn t seem worth prioritizing should i update the title and issue details 
if that s possible it would be awesome 
i ll check this when i have time let s close the issue until then 
commandline like 
if the approach i used is the recommended way to create a pr title and body inline then i think it should be given as an example of how to create a pr title and body in the command line although it would be nice if the string used for m were also escaped so then it could just be hub pull request m title goes here n n body nbody goes here 
sorry i didn t express clearly  version zsh 507 x apple x8664apple darwin 1400 darwin1400 by brew  using oh my zsh thank you 
i ve just used bare hub compare without any arguments repos available  thanks
mislav markdown code style grin just because it looks better for me 
one word gists they tend to have too long urls 
ups my mistake there have to be three dots instead of two in the proper url in simple cases git hub github adds the third one automatically like branch master but not in those complicated ones so the first case definitely works not an issue the second case head head 1head works also however perhaps not so well because git hub github s head can be something different than your head i presume git hub github s is just tip of master  maybe an interesting edge case issue i suggest to close the issue sorry 
i ll try pulling a later version
mislav thanks i ve flagged the package out of date on the official archlinux report 
i think i d prefer to always have my current cloned repos stored in this manifesto i agree that a simple bash script would the best solution if there isn t any tools available to automate this process 
hmm i had a similar issue in another repository and did some more digging you can overwrite the users core autocrlf settings for a repository in the gitattribute file moreover you can do so by matching against patterns therefore all the sh files could be set to use the linux line endings regardless of the users global settings i can t conceive of any user expecting to have windows line endings in a bash script file and it would allow the repository to build when people like me clone with silly settings 
git mac os 2190macos b 11 1014b11 mojave same issue with git and hub from master i have no aliases for hub 
mislav do you know where this needs to be done i d be happy to give this a try but i don t have an overview of the codebase 
thanks for your reply the discrepancy came from the workflow we manage tag s and our wrong assumptions that hub release delete tag will delete the release and as well the tag that it created before 1 hub release create m test test will create a tag release and create a release 2 hub release delete tag will delete the release but keep the tag so as the tag was already created any new release would just point to the tag that was created beforehand 
thanks mislav downloading a precompiled binary from the releases pages fixes it

with this following code snippet we had another error reference error referenceerror html pdf html2pdf is not defined 
arasabbasi im doing the simple demo in stalkblitz which is an online editor which does not have git installed you should think about that if the user doesn t have git than they cannot be allowed to use jspdf this is insane answer i have ever heard by a developer 
no i am not overwriting the save as saveas method anywhere is the one delivered with the js pdf jspdf library i also tried to use filesaver js but the same error occurred from my point of view i consider this flow closed because there is a solution to the unwanted behavior mentioned in the first place i only wanted to add a way of solving this for others that may encounter the same problem and if there are more robust or clean methods of solving it then to be added to this thread 
thanks i will try the node version out for my use case and report back 
tofra unfortunately i had a deadline and was not able to implement that part the window closing was more of a nice to have but no luck
changing the unit to pt doesn t help unfortunately the width option for html canvas html2canvas has no effect 
blockquote do you see the checked attributes on the nodes as in the screenshot above blockquote yes i do blockquote firefox version blockquote blockquote 40blockquote os blockquote mac osx blockquote 1064blockquote other extensions blockquote dom inspector this is similar to what i experienced in 1177 the menu isn t transparent this time 
i ll try to keep a long story short what my script basically does is just inject other files scripts css images into an existing website these injected scripts run inside the target page itself there are some reasons to do this  the target page and injected scripts are written against the qooxoo framework every javascript class is inside its own file  i don t want to merge all these separate files into one huge scripts so each file is defined as an resource  injected scripts run directly inside the page itself and escape the restrictions of the sandbox since an resource can be anything i need to know a way to dynamically detect the mimetype because injecting a script is different from injecting a css or an image you can have a look in my script http userscripts org scripts review 138566 there is a function load extensions loadextensions info is an instance of gm info  i propose that gm info not only gives me the names of the resources that are defined in a script but also any other information you can derive such as mimetype for backwards compatibility it s probably best not to touch the existing gm info resources array but maybe you could add a new array of resource info resourceinfo objects containing name url mimetype and maybe other information you could share about the resources 
i used 0413 nightly gm build now using 0415 the message is not present now but the whole scripts section is gone from addons manager edit oops if i open scripts manager from toolbar element the scripts show up in stylish userstyle section maybe stylish and gm are interferecing checking with stylish disabled now edit 2 edit2 very weird stylish disabled no scripts section if i open from toolbar element the scrips show ups in extensions section it seems the overlay of aom is messed up 
no new behaviors i can always use regexps but i would have to escape dots but just a nicer syntax 
sorry is that better 
or at least update the manager when it is opened from a browser restart or new tab 
no i do not think that it was meant to say to other if you install it you should be aware know of what i experienced use firefox 602 windows xp sp 3 sp3 norto internet security 2011 after installing greasemonkey 912 firefox became od 2 scripts did not work do not now where data is stored from scripts but suddenly all data vanished and do not know the exact reason other than it happened af installing greasemonkey 912
anything after 098 results in this behavior tested on 3 machines i don t get it only changes in 099 are

we use form validation from a popular rd 3rd party company that validation by default rejects this selection option value blah option if this option was not rejected by java script javascript validation then blah would be sent with the form data i don t think the value of the value attribute is sent with the form data because we ve been using this dropdown for a long time and only the default option has a value attribute i think only the inner html is sent as form data wymeditor removes the value attribute not the whole element i would like to have a default option that the form validation rejects so that users will be required to actually select the correct option on dec 13 2013 625 pm philip arndt notifications github com wrote

force ssl true causes an infinite loop in our case the rails application is getting http requests because cloud front cloudfront is terminating ssl this setting also has a lot of side effects that i d like to avoid do you think there is something a bit more specific to what i want 
as i understand no since modification of request headers needs to be done programmatically using javascript flash java etc these environments implement the same origin policy so that requests may only be sent to the same domain that the scripts are served from here s some more info if you re interested http code google com p browsersec wiki part 2 part2 same origin policy

sometimes i like to redefine some of the site options for example if i define list display order as descending and reference that option when creating the list id like to give a user the opportunity to order the list in a different way since i originally used an option to define order and used it throughout the code i have to redefine the option for it to take i ve been using  just figured it could be easier

that doesn t change anything unfortunately i ve been trying to work around this issue using the ignore command but it doesn t seem to have any effect on the localizable folder even when i add ignore on top of my config rb file it ignores all project files except those in the localizable folder they are still built as for the blog you had once recommended this to ignore some of the articles  in v 4 v4 i get an error since the blog variable can no longer be accessed from the config in any case this is just a minor annoyance it all works fine but it just takes a lot longer to deploy since middleman is building and deploying all files when i only need a small subset for each site 
i found the issue abridged config rb  my config rb had a def config in the helpers do block that was overwriting middleman s config renaming the method to site config seems to have done the trick 
sure 
yeah i think i ll do that lol thanks for your reply tdreyno 
perfect thanks 
oh yeah sure it s two files 
there is no error just files in my css dir ending in css scss don t get compiled to css instead they just get copied across as is if i replace and restart middleman server it works as desired 
this is using latest version of middleman i have just tried uninstalling all middleman gems and reinstalling gem install middleman the install succeeds i then try and create a new site named site middleman init test i get the exact same error i then tried using command bundle exec middleman init test which worked however if i then try and run middleman within my new directory test i get the exact same error mentioned above also tried running bundle exec middleman got a different error this time could not find gem middleman livereload run bundle install to install missing gems so i run bundle install it works and i can now view the site so whats going on here any idea why i have to follow this process to get it to work 
that s from beta 1 just upgraded to beta 2 and i get this errror 
yep check it out https imgur com a w qw te wqwte
i can try monday
yes i can post the full output if needed 
good idea tdreyno tried that and we get a dependency conflict 
you can use this new syntax with ruby 24 and later reidcooper i tried that also doesn t work 
hi synkied yes it does perfectly 
fabric 114 works properly with this script 
thank you for your answer i was looking for a more native way like the one you describe at first but you are right calling them as functions works totally fine and solves the problem 
so it tried shortening the code and that wasn t helping so i started playing with the 6 arc segment currently im at 05 here is a example of it failing while going clock wise on the o it got 34 of the way around and then stalls if i play with the 6 it will complete the clock wise circle but fail going counter clock wise i also turned the feed rate down to 200 in inkscape but seems really slow http i imgur com gy mgl 7gymgl jpg it started at the if you would like to see the gcode i will post it 
the code e code word in g code is precision feedrate for threading on lathes it may be old and seldom used today but still part of the standard and thus possible to encounter it in the wild and most importantly and like you found as well floating point numbers in g code do not use scientific notation so no interpreter should read code e code 12e10code as 12 1010 but rather as 12 for the previous word and 10 for the code e code word references  cnc programming handbook peter smid nd 2nd edition chapter 13 page 92 rs ngc rs274ngc v 3 v3 kramer et al title 3321 page 17 in reference to the protocol process comment i don t think the e word should be outright stripped from the stream but rather prevented from interfering with strtod s parsing semantics the diff i sent is just one way of doing it i m sure there s a lot more to pick from in reference to code x 0x code hexadecimal decoding which in the particular case of code strtod code is also influenced by code p code which is the binary exponent delimiter just as code e code is the decimal exponent delimiter it will only happen if the current block is arranged conveniently in order to elicit the behaviour this means the currently scanned word s value must be written as a single code code 0code followed immediately by the code x code word and optionally followed by the code p code word for maximum damaging effect for erroneous code e code decoding you simply need the current word s value to be succeeded by the code e code word practical examples  code g 0 g0 x 0010 x0010 y code y502code  this will parse as g x 0010 0x0010 0003906 that will result in an error invalid command instead of g 0 and x 0010 please note that the whole code x code word is eaten up by the conversion and is not seen by the rest of the code code g 01 g01 x 502 x502 e 10 e10 y code y322code  this will parse as g 1 x e 10 502e10 5020000000000 y 322 instead of g 1 x 502 e 10 and y 322 the whole code e code word is eaten up just like above code g 82 g82 z 0 z0 x 15 x15 p code p4code  this will parse as g 82 z x p 4 0x152p4 3380 instead of g 82 z 0 x 15 and p 4
thanks for the replies i m pretty new to microcontrollers csdexter i was following the wiki at https github com grbl grbl wiki flashing grbl to an arduino i googled using the ide s avrdude directly but it seems more complex for newbies like me to deal with if there are options like xloader and arduino uploader arduinouploader 
no problem i will try to answer your questions in english  der frickler derfrickler you are right the software is written in qt with open gl opengl we wrote it for windows so for some features some has to impelement the linux or mac details but this shoud be easy for a linux or mc user the board on the pictures is our only prototype we added more features to the pcb as grbl needs like a sd card and several digital and analog inputs and outputs in next time we have to check this new functions at possible errors if all of this is checked we will order more of the pcbs blinkenlight for the new version of the xmega firmware we used grbl 80 until today we prorted about 90 of the whole grbl code to the new controller we only have to implement the code for the limit switches 
the nist spec pdf http citeseerx ist psu edu viewdoc summary doi 1011157813 does not actually mention 281 and 301 so maybe it s a linux cnc linuxcnc specific way of setting those positions the only thing the linux cnc linuxcnc spec says is g 281 g281 stores the current absolute position into parameters 51615166 i guess my point is that adding parameters to the g 281 g281 call should not cause the machine to move whether it silently ignores the parameters or throws an error doesn t really matter but unexpected machine movement is never a good thing 
indeed the nist g code standard says only the name of the plane xz it doesn t say anything about the order i think the right hand rule must be followed here g 17 g17 x y goes to the z direction thus x y z g 18 g18 z x goes to the y direction thus z x y g 19 g19 y z goes to the x direction thus y z x with the emc 2 emc2 generated gcode files the grbl produces the xz arcs correctly only when the order is z x y that s why i opened this issue 
chamnit i mean i can not play the arduino as a regular one i just want to test the grbl and i have to do some other experiments on my uno but now i cannot no matter what code i upload the arduino uno always works as a cnc control i want to know how to remove grbl from my uno t t thank you shapeoko thanks
here you are http youtu be yt o f yto0f c j lk c3jlk sorry for that lousy quality btw at beginning it is somwhow dark but it is ok if you restart the vid a second time you see the proper intital aceleration then several sudden direction changes and then at end a proper decelaration program g 90 g90 g 21 g21 g 1 g1 x y 100 x100y100 x y x150y 150 x y 100 x100y100 x y x150y 150 replacing g 1 g1 with g 0 g0 is cathastrophic severe and total step losses partly missing direction change totally at my first square shape milled in air only the gantry appoaches a corner decelerationg and then performs a sudden power start at the the other axis at corners with arcs it performs well as i am a novice in milling i cannot find the exact code in the program where the corner is performed i hope you got the info you expeced thanks john
hi sorry i try to explain the issue is that i send the homing command then z moves as expected then only y seeks for the end switch after it is found both x and y are moving to the pull off position mm 1mm in my setup this has the effect that x is traveling mm 1mm away every time i send h hope this explains the situation
since i wanted a right turning axis system and starting with z 0 on the top of my object resulting in everything i cut away has a positive increasing z coordinate my axis are in the left rear corner with y pointing towards yourself with x to the right and z pointing down switches are at the rear left and top 
thanks swarfer i hadn t seen the gnea port of this 
yes this is the link https www youtube com watch v cq cvux l o cq8cvux6l1o in the first part i do the homing so that you see it and in the second part i deactivate the homing alarm and move the axes freely without problems
no because the probe will take different amounts of time depending upon how far the torch head is from the work piece at the start once the probe is finished the thc sends the signal to the plasma power supply to fire the arc so the cnc needs to resume movement at a precise time with relation to that arc 
my x axis driver has no issues like this the red led still stays on while it runs 
arduino 189 my grbl is in c user pc documents arduino libraries grbl is adding through add zip library in arguing ide c program files x arduino x86arduino libraries this is the location of where my arduino and others example such as blink and default libraries are i have two grbl file another is under grbl master which is in this pc downloads
yup that s exactly where i got the link sounds like a good solution to me thanks 
it occurred for the first time the second time it was fine 
here is one in f 23 f23 but there are a lot more https bodhi fedoraproject org updates fedora e b b 201628e824b24b
those bugs are not really expected to be in any other state than new hence the code was rarely used and i d say to not add it to bodhi 2 bodhi2
yes should be clear from the log i guess lkundrak edited this update new build s 
just tried it and my browser is okay and i got the preview so i guess it s good however i discovered another issue https github com fedora infra bodhi issues 677

python 27 but that shouldn t really matter since fd inheritance is a known feature of the exec system calls this is also something that gunicorn counts on for the gunicorn fd thing to work we just need to control which fds that are inherited

i can t test right now but tonight i ll try changing the pidfile value to a few different locations and verify that it s creating it with a weird value my workaround that i figured out last night is to run gunicorn with upstart instead of an init script and let upstart manage the pid but that was a whole other bag of worms with the daemon and expect fork stuff thanks for your work on this project i ll update tonight ben

you re right the binary thing is a red herring it looks like this fails  but replacing yield ok with return ok works fine am i reading the spec wrong http www python org dev peps pep 0333 when called by the server the application object must return an iterable yielding zero or more strings this can be accomplished in a variety of ways such as by returning a list of strings or by the application being a generator function that yields strings or by the application being a class whose instances are iterable regardless of how it is accomplished the application object must always return an iterable yielding zero or more strings i can t tell if this means you re not allowed to yield list of strings

sorry i have absolutely no context for why it was happening other than the fact that it was master as of the time of the post my production was broken so i had to blow it away i figured that something else had probably just been fixed and hopefully you d recognize it better than not mentioning it at all i m waiting for a release to fix the stop iteration stopiteration and the must end with py configuration issue if i upgrade any of my other applications gunicorns they ll break 
i did not send any signal to master it just killed the worker after a while but i tested gunicorn the app as a deamon process and then the worker had not been killed any more 
sorry benoitc for wasting your time the problem wasn t in gunicorn i found out that i had missed one of init scripts that launches everything

benoitc i just wanted to manage all the logs to filter classification but why not let access logs to syslog what s the reason 
i don t know why is it originally making the check len self ioloop timeouts  1
by later i only meant later down in the code of that file the membership models membership is what s throwing an attribute error because it doesn t realize its been imported at the top of the file to repeat myself slightly this is intermittent and so it fails sometimes and other times it passes i m not sure how else to debug this fwiw we ve just upgraded to django 18 on the app which contains this code and we are no longer having this issue so it does indeed seem related to something between gunicorn 1930 and django 14 but i m not sure what that might be i ve updated the code snippet so the word later no longer exists

ron the behavior didn t changed whether using the default sync worker class or gevent the default number of worker connections is http 1000http docs gunicorn org en stable settings html worker connections so this shouldn t be the problem i was testing a non production url 
using falcon it s append header x rate limit 123 in x 194x it works
benoitc well i didn t actually want to use hexadecimal it was just the easiest example to show gunicorn not working as documented octal on the other hand is much friendlier than decimal for setting a umask and i spent quite a while trying to figure out why my permissions were all wrong before i realised the octal number i d passed to gunicorn 0117 was being interpreted as decimal 117 instead of what the documentation suggests int 0117 0 79
would a better approach be to just add an abbreviate setting to the existing functionality that would make the proctitle format be either gcn mst proc name and gcn wrk proc name when set or is it better to just add a don t annotate option that makes the process name exactly what the user specifies with no details added at all by gunicorn 
sorry for the late reply benoitc the issue i m seeing is actually the non active threads doing this my active threads don t timeout my the non active ones under less load give more critical timeout errors than just gracefully timing out i switched from gevent to tornado and that seems to have fixed the hang issue but i m still seeing 3 workers consistently giving the critical timeout every 30 seconds if it s a normal timeout it shouldnt be a critical error 
replied with email 
thankyou i will see it 
all workers do this upon receiving the usr 1 usr1 signal  def handle usr self usr1self sig frame self log reopen files the reopen files function in glogging will then do this with self lock this is most likely the culprit 
it is just a django rest application nothing fancy the maximum time a request takes to respond is 12 seconds so its impossible to reach 4000 as you can see in the logs i just started gunicorn with that configuration and after a few minutes it started booting new workers 
just try starting gunicorn with the log config dict option and some argument it will always fail  there s no way to pass a python dict from the shell you can only pass a string and the code in gunicorn isn t setup to do the conversion from the string representation of the dict to the python dict object 
under werkzeug flask its working fine this the response i get to see in postman tool is status code is coming as 500 this is flow of functions called base call https user images githubusercontent com f d e a 4132035448394695888f1d00e73a e f ab df e png 11e88f55ab9df446e168png wrapper https user images githubusercontent com cf f e b 41320354483948401cf97f80e73b e a c df e a 11e89a92399c73df7e9a png error class https user images githubusercontent com a f e a 4132035448394737a9f00900e73a e ba c b ec bb png 11e88ba28c3b3ec9bb55png 
hi benoit thanks for your reply i am aware of the danger of having an object shared in memory let me explain my intention was thinking how to store let s say user session data which becomes a problem when you spawn more than one worker actually i am solving it now by starting a simple socket server kasi https github com lhotakj kasi before gunicorn  i could have use eg redis but i preferred something small which doesn t require installation however i still think it could be achieved internally by gunicorn like another process exactly as you proposed  it s not completely ready missing readme tests install but the server client work well thanks 
benoitc os ubuntu 1604 gunicorn 1990 flask 102 gunicorn config 
i run it on a synology ds 918 ds918 i don t think that there is a loadbalancer or anything got also really heavy dockers like plex with gb 2gb ram usage running without any problems 
thanks looks good to me 
it was 122 before i just upgraded it to 140
it s a healthcheck 
thank you i have solved this error 
command line looks like this again slightly modified to anonymize 
this is the error log i m getting when running gunicorn gevent 1990
we think it may have something to do with this definition of scope binding https github com techtalk spec flow specflow wiki scoped bindings which says and it looks like it s combining them with or it would be nice to see scenario info scenarioinfo tags and feature info featureinfo tags together i am not sure i understand what you are suggesting what is the hook parameter

i guess i just assumed that the general purpose before scenario beforescenario the one without any limitation by a tag would always be executed first before any more specific more targeted before scenario beforescenario extra setup extrasetup methods that are most focused specific to a given situation i really don t want to clutter up my general purpose setup method with code that s only ever needed in two of my rather many scenarios and i don t like the idea of having to explicitly call my general purpose setup method from the specific extra setup methods either hmmm not quite happy with this situation here

i thought i had i even added new feature files clean rebuild and still had the issue until i downgraded nunit but you are right i am now able to compile with nunit 381 not sure what the issue was as only one project in the solution uses nunit the new generated code behind still uses test fixture attribute testfixtureattribute but it works ok thanks for the quick response 
adding the example config http specflow org documentation configuration seems to resolve the issue  thank you for your quick response

sabotage andi sabotageandi yes this project is currently on v 19 v19 it s been rock solid so far with our suite of k 10k tests so upgrading just hasn t made it to the top of the backlog yet i ve updated the repro project to the v 231 v231 packages and the problem is still happening the only change was a slightly different stack trace in the error it definitely seems to be related to the extension version not the package version here is the v 231 v231 error message 
ah thanks for the tip i have this fuslog entry it looks like it is trying to find log net log4net in the jetbrains folder for some reason i suppose i can drop log net log4net in there and see what happens but that is a workaround and not a fix for other devs in my group if i want to include these tests any suggestions sorry about the formatting can t seem to fix the bold text 
apologies for the delay in replying it s been a busy summer i ve posted some sample code over at kevinkuszyk specflow table to complex type sample https github com kevinkuszyk specflow table to complex type sample in that repo you can see the verify properties and create set verifypropertiesandcreateset extension method which allows a step like this  the code in the table extensions tableextensions class has been copied over as is from one of our interal repros it needs some clean up before it s ready to be contributed back to the main spec flow specflow project 
that seems to have fixed it do these steps need to be followed every time a feature file is added do these issues only apply to net core and spec flow specflow v 3 v3 i am having the same issue on my project using specflow 24 with net v 45 v45 and was just trying to create a completely fresh project as an example 
yes sabotage andi sabotageandi i have tried removing it but then the feature cs will not be auto generated on save but on build it will create the cs file this file does not get included in the project though also what i did observe was the feature cs file like before does not get linked under the parent file if i remove the spec flow single file generator specflowsinglefilegenerator from the custom tool customtool 
sabotage andi sabotageandi after adding unit test provider unittestprovider exception is solved in my case unit test provider configuration unittestproviderconfiguration use unit test provider useunittestprovider nunit  also i am getting below error why does it asking me to add tech talk techtalk spec flow specflow spec flow specflow is already part of spec flow specflow tools ms build msbuild generation plugin err https 1https user images githubusercontent com ef a b 39798297608760446737ef80a23b e ab 11e982ab cf b e da cf cf7b8e3da3cf jpg i am using generator plugin in my sample project please find csproj file content https gist github com gittadesushil c f d d d faab c e d c e c5f293d1d40d993faab14c8e81d68c4e in above csproj file even if i removed the spec flow single file generator specflowsinglefilegenerator from global setting it still getting created and if i remove it overrides the csproj file again  i use below tag so that my generator plugin loads from specified path  i feel package reference packagereference which i included are correct 
when we first create the feature file the cs file is auto generated 
yes no new feature files were added to project but i did remove all existing references to feature files within the csproj as indicated in the blog 
we decide to use nunit for unit test instead of spec flow specflow runner still using spec flow specflow to sync the cucumber features but using xamarin ui test uitest to run the ui test by now we gonna keep the current setup and see if the team gets used with bdd i will close the issue 
i get that right now and no i used angle brackets to detail what was in each double quotes and forgot that it was markup so it got removed 
30220 yes i checked it on 30225 and it works thank you 
hi that is the same issue editing existing feature file or adding new one noting happens in code behind and new scenarios are not visible in execution environment my workaround could not be applied in you case if your files are generated via microsoft tools i cannot help you because but you can read next https specflow org generating 2019generating code behind files using msbuild https specflow org documentation generate tests from msbuild if you find something out share it here 
the spec flow specflow runner version is 3141 we were using the spec flow specflow xunit in azure pipeline without any issues but when we switched to spec flow specflow runner all tests are skipped and logged the errors in the log file there is no error when i run the tests in visual studio is there any additional setup required for spec flow specflow runner in azure pipeline thanks image https user images githubusercontent com ea 153810097244195199418580377911ea cd ad d c png 8681cd920ad0d4c6png 
i am creating non cli test runner for specflow mstest based integration tests so that no additional processes needed to run them because combination of dotnet cli vstest testhost is too heavy to do what is actually needed run a test and make a simple report with results timing and logs i can create test result file compatible with azure devops but the only thing i miss is full log including specflow test tracer testtracer s logs i cannot capture all the logs from console because of possible concurrency issues i am also not sure if test tracer testtracer always writes to console on all environments given that i am going to execute tests in azure s consumption plan

yes this is what i m referring to i suppose that this might not be a bug so much as a choice that was made to exclude the sub categories from appearing in the main content block under fa qs faqs in network in your example that said i d really like to see the subcategories listed there even better an option to have all articles in subcategories counted under the main category so that for example rss subscriptions on a main category would also return articles assigned to subcategories ashland or usa matthew xentana com on sat dec 29 2012 at 1240 am thorsten rinne notifications github comwrote

that error is gone but now i see the following briefly when opening a c file 
it was fixed thanks 
the sign in underlined because i have my highlight error group set to use and undercurl the text above in the second image is supposed to be trailing white space highlighted using set list it s really the first character that s the problem though see how it looks different than the others it s like whatever was used to do the error highlighting stayed put even though i inserted a couple of lines how does syntastic do its error highlighting i found that i turned it off that i don t get the problem maybe i can reproduce it with a lot less vimscript involved i m not using janus though i am using several other plugins i did try narrowing things down i disabled nearly all of my plugins and cut out most of my vimrc but the problem still exists it is actually detecting errors in the case above it was complaining about the block having the wrong indentation since i didn t implement init which is correct it s just that the error highlighting is getting off when adding new lines i m still trying to narrow it down more it s possible that it could be a bug in vim i certainly haven t ruled it out

it is pretty weird but that problem is now gone i did a bit of revamp of my plugins though so i am guessing there was some other plugin configuration that triggered the syntax check 
nop i don t have installed eclim if ubuntu don t install it default 
thank you i see could you recommend python syntax checker 
fair enough 
suggest abstract method has not been implemented
sorry maybe itis my fault it is not the issue of stc i do not know why this file can be compile without error 20151204 https 204325https cloud githubusercontent com assets b a 1314241811589961b136178a ac e f 9ac711e5811f d d png 72d244d61153png 
steps to reproduce 1 open tmux session 2 open vim in that session 3 open a java script javascript or ruby file 4 save what happens aforementioned error appears what should happen no errors should appear on save 
yes i have rst pseudoxml rst2pseudoxml py installed 
i m using the last version scss lint 0480
so you are in vim and syntastic has run say shellcheck on the file in the editor and shellcheck has found some errors when you move to a line with an error you decide you want to ignore that error rather than having to open a new line above the line with the error and then type in the  shellcheck disable sc it would be nice to have a perhaps  command perhaps called ignore that automatically opens the line s above the line you are on that has the error s on it that you typed ignore on and inserts the  shellcheck disable sc for you shellcheck of course is just an example here should be the same for pylint or any other checker 
well i d rather disable syntastic for git commit messages because i don t need it in this case but i don t think it s normal that it crashes vim if it is enabled here s the syntastic info syntasticinfo when i m editing a commit message 
lcd 047 lcd047 i commented this out in vimrc and it s working now let g syntastic ignore files m c ui m c config h m c global they are c files 
thank you for your prompt reply if i issue let g syntastic aggreate errors on or true yes the problem still persists what did i do i switched to the watson root directory and opened watson watson py i applied the following patch and saved the patch is diff git a watson watson py b watson watson py index e abd edff 69 e32abd71edff69 100644 a watson watson py b watson watson py 15 16   coding utf 8 import numpy import datetime from functools import reduce import json 710 810 import operator import os import uuid try  import configparser except import error importerror  import config parser configparser as configparser  try import configparser  except import error importerror  import config parser configparser as configparser import arrow import click import requests what did i expect i expected that syntastic would invoke flake 8 flake8 and report the superfluous import of numpy what happened instead no error is reported the file looks error free from inside v im vim

showerst regarding the carryover practices true it varies state to state part of my job alas is to find out how it varies the legislator handbook for hawaii states http lrbhawaii org hndbook hbk html hbk6html since 1969 the bill numbers for the carried over bills are likewise carried over apparently they had a constitutional convention in 68 and wrote it into the thing as article http 3http lrbhawaii org con conart html conart3html section 15 which specifically states any bill pending at the final adjournment of a regular session in an odd numbered year shall carry over with the same status to the next regular session for hawaii it seems that implicitly the bill numbers are the same i e the two bills are one in the same as they are not reintroduced within the biennium hence the clerks do not assign new numbers to carried over bills 
i don t think i ve linked it before but here it is http stuff lucideer com modernizr though can t say it ll be permanently there 
well i know when following best practices in web application design the application should look consistent across all major browsers but sometimes you need to handle a very rare cases for example we were developing a website using liferay portal and we didn t figure out that we need to support ie 6 ie6 till the end of the project and these browser type and version class name supported by liferay helped us a lot modernizer is a great library and i thought it will be cool to have such feature 
i think having a css prefix for all css feature detects is an easy and quite clearly delineated start and could also be implemented without having to think about how to standardize names of other features could also be split into css sel selectors and css prop properties though i don t see the point in doing that as regards other features it s certainly a lot less clear where the dividing line goes if something is isn t in the html 5 html5 spec this is often not widely known e g i thought geolocation was html 5 html5 but have just checked and been proved wrong so html 5 html5 probably isn t a good choice of prefix equally html js and dom as the line where one ends and the other begins is often blurry so i suppose my best proposal is css properties prefixed with css  introduce camel casing mainly because js almost always uses camel casing and it s a bit odd to test for e g the existence of web s ocket by checking for modernizr web s ocket 
of course thats why am reporting this as an issue
i have no idea i just tried it today also document implementation has feature hasfeature events text input textinput  returns false even though the event is supported

what the w c w3c says http www w org w3org tr html video html5video html the ready states note authors are urged to use the autoplay attribute rather than using script to trigger automatic playback as this allows the user to override the automatic playback when it is not desired e g when using a screen reader authors are also encouraged to consider not using the automatic playback behavior at all and instead to let the user agent wait for the user to start playback explicitly 
sure thing you can find it at the below url it appears that the css zooming enlarging happens in ie 8 ie8 ie 7 ie7 in windows xp and ie 7 ie7 in windows 7 http www designerdean com temp layout html layout1html
it s fine in desktop browsers i ve tried ie 6 firefox 2 opera 11 chrome safari 4 and i m pretty sure about older safari and opera although i don t have them to hand mobile i don t know i only have i os ios 5 devices fine in those although i recall that prior to i os ios 5 you could set contenteditable on an element and it would claim to be contenteditable without actually allowing editing as noted in the undetectables page not sure where to find details in http html test html5test com about contenteditable in mobile i can see that it s testing for content editable contenteditable and is content editable iscontenteditable but if there s more detail then i missed it 
i threw an alert in there before the  and the alert itself is now throwing the error 
will do 
appears so sorry my bad 
i generated something like this http modernizr com download shiv cssclasses load at the bottom of an un minified file right before yepnope is this  so when browserify wraps this up in a closure this is now that function not the window 
patrickkettner chrome version 4702526111 bit 64bit i build all features include in page and refresh page 
any build on https modernizr com that includes test all props testallprops download is currently ing 404ing though 
the one that results from bower info modernizr i am personally trying to use release 283
sure here s a code pen codepen with a modernizr build with only the localizednumber test active unminified http codepen io anon pen bjwjxq
well all i really want is a clean build of modernizr and i can just check the built version into source in fact that s what we re doing now the goal of the current exercise is to run the npm and bower invocations and end up with the modernizr js script in my lib directory running npm install modernizr and bower install modernizr creates the modernizr directory with all the files i need but then when i try to run the binary executable it complains about missing dependencies i install them by hand with npm install and then i can run bin modernizr and everything s ok i just thought that the nature of npm  bower would be to include the dependencies 
hi patrick oh ok i got it i have an if condition where we were checking modernizr csstransitions to execute some statements on the same condition i would like to also check if ie version less than 11 or 9 project requirement i thought we have some way to test this using modernizr and as i didn t found in docs i thought to check with your team apologies for that if we have some way to check using modernizr script just let me know else please close this issue thanks for your quick response 
not yet i have an idea going with svg and foreign object foreignobject to canvas but was hoping somebody else might already have needed this 
karma tests adapting to browser features it is certainly possible to test useragent but isn t the point of modernizr 
well i guess we will disagree if you decide not to follow semver versioning https docs npmjs com about semantic versioning as would be expected of a respectable project i guess anyone who depends on your project should be extra wary about the way you decide to consume breaking changes from projects you depend on into your own but hey the original intent was just to inform you and anyone else who stumbles into this issue since you feel you are beyond constructive feedback and are just dismissive then good riddance 
the test page works correctly digging further it looks like the site i was investigating https www webliero com must have configured modernizr to use dom prefixes we no longer prefix rtc peer connection rtcpeerconnection so it fails to recognize the support the site may be looking for the prefixed version because they are using the deprecated chrome specific callback based ap is apis which we don t support i ll close as behaves correctly 
hmm thought about the security implications and there is one right now that ll i ll fix i haven t protected the path sessions impersonate so once i do that then you ll only be able to impersonate someone if you are logged in and have role admin other than that the only security issue is if someone writes code that uses the method set current account temp directly however that is the same security gap as the current method set current account

yes http gist github com 588525 you can easily reproduce this by doing these commands gem install padrino padrino g project test app d datamapper b cd test app padrino g admin padrino rake dm migrate seed it looks like the admin is not creating the migrations file in db migrations when using sqlite no matter what the orm used

maybe a more granular way to control log level turning off all debug messages would be counterproductive 
thank you for reply and sorry for my own mistakes i stupidly disabled the layout in app rb everything works fine now thanks
it s probably not worth doing seems a bit complicated and you should pretty much always be able to replace relative links to rooted links in your own application but if you re rendering http example com app bar baz i d expect absolute url foo to return http example com app bar foo i e take the current request url and replace whatever is after the last slash in path with the argument but request url also gives misleading result so it s not that simple 
ujifgc that looks great thanks so much for the quick response 
dariocravero middleware was my plan i d had thought about running it on es js es6js as the extension and serve it to the browser as js or es js es5js my logic on that is that while we could run it on all js files there is no value in wasting resources on transpiling something to itself you could though run js  js though you could do es 6 es6 and convert on the fly to js for transpiling and serving would depend on how padrino wanted to address the issue of es 6 es6 my thought is there are two real options  js to js  simplest option for users and least likely to confuse people es js es6js to js  es 6 es6 to js  makes sure that the developer understands what they are writing and relies on them to make the correct name with that said this should come with performance benefits as you can avoid all files without the extension and not have to do any analysis my guess is we will need to use something like browserify for module though i haven t looked at any of the es 6 es6 shims enough to be able to say if there is a shim which would be lighterweight what are your thoughts 
if i switch require relative to require config filename it stops double parsing the file and the routes still do not work i ve noticed that the boot process for sequel is significantly slower on rubinious so is starting the server and then it works are there any deferred or threaded operations in padrino mount on tue oct 27 2015 at 242 pm igor bochkariov notifications github com wrote   curtis j schofield senior systems analyst u u u2u skype robotarmymade second life curtis linden c 4156326001 linden lab makers of shared creative spaces

let me just check now

thanks this works with the following modification profile load no focus lib false
this is the web step i used http gist github com 598803 the link looks like this a href javascript void 0 onclick picture upload  profile information toggle change picture a gems used capybara 039 cucumber rails 032 cucumber 090
yeah agreed just enough to remind them 
sorry about that now it seems to work just fine i must have been there it at a bad time 
okay wow not sure how or what but gem capybara installed an older 04 version of capybara i just changed it to gem capybara  100 it s working now thank you for pointing this out better watch out for other outdated gems as well i always figured adding gem xxx without any version number always gets the latest version of that gem guess not 
yes problem still persists with selenium webdriver 2122
i didn t touch automatic reload i think i have to use the wait until in this case when i do the initial has no css call the element is actually on the page and it is visible i would assume that in this case capybara would just return false the element disappears probably 34 seconds after the call hence i have to wait until it happens or is that something that should be caught by an implicit wait i thought this problem was more of a generic race condition between discovering the element the element disappearing and checking the element s visibility 
good point the problem applies to anything that can be disabled really 
i am using capybara 112
the selenium driver appears to fail too  looks like the bug was in 114 for supporting it thanks for the clarifying questions 
how about adding a flag to check if javascript is disabled 
phantom js phantomjs w poltergeist
you re right there is no way to tell for sure i was just suggestion something which i think could work than the simple sleep 01
so in my specific use case i am refactoring a bunch of specs that i did not write to use headless chrome instead of poltergeist one of them is testing that the pop up comes up before reloading if this is an automatic browser feature then i guess you could argue that there s no need to test the browser behavior since that should be tested already then again a failing spec here could be really useful should chrome ever remove this feature or change how it is triggered and i m not sure i d assume this is terrible ux we are dealing with forms filled out by internal users that could have a lot of data and are very sensitive to our business if someone accidentally refreshed perhaps forgetting which tab they are in they could lose a lot of time reentering all that data not so horrendous in that case edit i d suggest just making this behavior optional default it to what it does now but allow people to turn it off in case they need to since it d have to be a conscious decision there would be room to explain in the docs why this might not be the most prudent way to go 
d oh figures it s one of the 7 p rs prs already open p yeah i just need to be able to ignore the querystring i have a multi subdomain site so i want to check i m at the subdomain corresponding to my single sign on portal but the query will never match because it contains encrypted hashed session info 
i was told that when you specify chrome as the driver that options works the same as chrome options chromeoptions which takes a binary parameter in any case how do i specify the binary location for the driver thanks sent from my i phone iphone
looking into that the output test it should accept  so this pull do as it is expected on pawn preprocessor directives https github com addonszz uncrustify commit f e fba ad f ea 42813 116093133f9724e97150fba68ad03f901ea42813 however that code mime seen not good so later i will try to use your approach for vala 
ok i ll try the current version probably the issue is already fixed the first post and my local build is 17 days ago thank you 
there is no class statement it s at global scope the segmentation fault doesn t print any additional info i was running it from a cygwin bash but even using windows cmd it just pops up a regular windows a program has stopped working message 
i am not sure if that can be arith in any situations because there is new on right side and between and there is no i believe that all something without  something else but without  new something but can be different something again but can be empty should be considered as pointer even the first something would be multiple lines and contain  equal amount  if there is after the but before new then it could be macro and arith but if no then it cannot be macro and new could be also be some malloc or some realloc and so on for example char malloc and i am too busy with own pointless projects but i hope these situations can be improved later uncrustify seems to be very good

yeah probably as original bindings are reason of often segfaults but this will definitely require more work than proposed idea 
ok cayorodriguez thanks will do that 
hi ok i guess it was somewhat unclear to me what tag sents is supposed to do then since i had developed my script with 300 originally i was under the impression that segmentation tokenization was always going to be done by the stanford code but tag sents was simply the variant suited for tagging multiple sentences actually i found that behavior to be fairly useful if it is not the intended default behavior i would certainly suggest to make it available as optional behavior same for pos tagger postagger actually note that using the stanford tokenizer also provided robustness against certain types of easy to run into problems even for the single sentence case for instance the stanford ner tagger expects punctuation to be provided as separate tokens if input is pre tokenized which is typically not quite as easy to achieve as splitting raw input on whitespace as one example of many the code provided in issue 761 is incorrect in this case in providing tokens such as abend containing punctuation having the stanford tagger deal with all such subtleties appropriately and automatically is definitely comfortable so summary this is not the same request as 761 rather i would like to optionally get back the behavior that i can safely pass non tokenized or mis tokenized text to the ner tagger regards thomas
sorry i forgot to update this i was able to finally get it to work i think the problem was my high latency satelite internet connection was probably conflicting with an aggressive connection timeout or somthing similiar on the download server after network conditions improved i was able to download the data thanks

are similar with word net wordnet similarity but the problem is nltk also returns similarity value between a verb sense and a noun which is not a scenario in word net wordnet similarity and more importantly if i change the order of words in path similarity function for nltk it returns completely different values for different part of speech and i do not observe this behavior in word net wordnet similarity following are the values nltk returns when i change word order while calling path similarity function synset distance v 01 synset tax v 02 02 synset outdistance v 01 synset tax v 02

jnothman alvations thank you for the comment the is mostly deterministic in marking the end of a sentence in chinese but there are still occasions that it does not my idea was to use punkt to solve these ambiguous cases but if a space is required for the training it may not be able to do the job but i think the general idea proposed in the paper might still work for chinese

they tend to be convenient intermediate expressions consider the case of constructing an ordered dictionary an array of objects indexed by some name right now this can be written as follows 
i would love to i hope i can find some time to do this 
this would randomly shuffle the elements of an array as if they were a deck of cards someone shuffled with their hands essentially it is the opposite of a sorting algorithm dealing cards exemplifies a good use case for this you shuffle the array then pop elements off of it you can see a good evenly distributed shuffle algorithm implemented in javascript here http en wikipedia org wiki fisher e yates e28093yates shuffle example implementations
thanks it s really nice to have this in 
object keys keys a returns 0 1 the keys for b are correct i m not on the latest master i ve encountered this issue on the latest release 
just what i needed sorry for not rtfm 
ah yes master does fix it many thanks 
jeremy i m suggesting a little more than key value ordering  treat a hash as an array of key values pairs key 1 key1 val 1 val1 key 2 key2 val 2 val2 key n keyn val n valn  have hash comprehension that can build a hash not just an array map hash maphash returns a hash for example here s how one could imagine map hash maphash 1 hash is converted to array of key value pairs conceptually perhaps not literally 2 iterator is called with key value deconstructed into first two arguments idx becomes rd 3rd argument 3 iterator returns key value pair 4 array of key value pairs is converted back to a hash which is returned here s a sample implementation using each notice the idx variable  cheers 
i started from there and used tmpl obj  it works but then realized that i need to assume obj to be passed into my next pre compiled template that becomes cumbersome to alway adding that in the template with what is suggested it takes away the need to specify obj and underscore will take care of it thinking that this is a super light weight sub template mechanism it gives a pretty simple way to embed template out of the box without complicated implementation this becomes handy when using with template helpers templatehelpers in backbone marionette
it can also be used to avoid unnecessary object creation and gc this changed  replaced with clear this changed especially when this changed was already empty 
akre 54 akre54 221 is about remove single key my suggestion is about alternative to existing function omit with same interface for using omit when you need a new object as result or using remove when you just want to remove some keys from object 
hi i m trying to do this on node js what do i need to add so that underscore is similarly registered on 20 december 2013 1941 kit cambridge notifications github com wrote 
well a date object is not an empty object so it should return false but i guess you re right the description says enumerable object like arrays and hashes so it could be the expected behavior
o ok ook there is no bug in underscore js for this issue now i understand the problem was that i have tried single functionality without include all the library so the initial declaration was not imported sorry for the wrong report 
i m using the newest version 182 i saw this fixes that you mentioned but in the line 1229 the typeof int array int8array object is false in my browser mac 10102 safari 803 so the method override does not execute in the next line 
in angular vue js vuejs react etc you have object with all data props for every form which you have after sending this data successful you need to clear content of properties but not erase whole model 20160615 1405 gmt 0100 adam krebs notifications github com

i switched to the recent code base i e 21 and the problem is solved i raised this issue over the mailing list and dhammika helped me with it we were talking of supporting duplicate identities lets say two connecting sockets have the same identity set on them shouldn t the sockets receive the messages intended for that identity 
just test it with v 21 same result output ith v 20 server  curl 1270015559 assertion failed fetched rep cpp 232 curl 52 empty reply from server 1 aborted php server php output ith v 21 server  curl 1270015559 assertion failed msg flags zmq msg more rep cpp 81 curl 52 empty reply from server 1 aborted php server php
ok i see now i thought that in a valid message all bits that are not flags are clear but if such bits should be set then it makes sense now please give me a day i will either prepare a simple test program to show a problem or figure out how i should use mq 0mq api now after 215 it s almost am 1am here so i d like to do it tomorrow

hi thanks for the response i am unable to produce a minimal test case as it s not obvious which condition is triggering this failed assertion it is happening in my unit tests although i believe that issue may have also occurred in non unit test scenarios too i am running on centos 72 vm on virtual box the difference between unit test and non unit test execution of these code paths is the protocol ipc for former epgm tcp for latter in both scenarios there are also inproc sockets involved 
ws apoll wsapoll will not capture events that fail to connect asynchronously and will always block it even with pollin pollout
yesi use but 421but where can i get 422
have made a try 
define zmq version major 4 define zmq version minor 1 define zmq version patch 2 windows
it s been many years at least i ve changed the link above also pr here https github com zeromq libzmq pull 2631 my use case is similar to this https github com saltstack salt issues 23246 although on the client side so it s probably not a new problem the function is called from tcp connecter and listener 
not at this point i m still trying to narrow down the conditions that trigger the crash as mentioned it is very intermittent and of course libzmq is at the bottom of a pile of libraries any of which could be the culprit which makes a repro even more difficult having said that it has happened at least twice and in both cases get tid was called with a null this pointer from send command  in both cases cmd destination is null fwiw i ve since removed the calls to disconnect unbind mentioned above and have not seen the crash since then of course that may just mean that the crash has gone from very intermittent to almost never it s the almost part that worries me 
i meet the problem only once i have tested many times but can t reproduce in fact i use zmq socket in different threads so i have use mutex to ensure the zmq socket can t be used by zmq send and zmq recvmsg at the same time but zmq poll is not in critical section the real code is complex i simplify it to the flowing 
hmm as server is always 0 is because of backward compatibility  no not yet i m new to zeromq so i just wanted to hear some opinion from developers first before writing code i thought about implementing new option zmq curve server auto when this option is set to 1 and if inbound connection with as server 1 in greeting received then socket will act as client for this connection and as server 0 will be sent to connecting client this way no changes in zmtp specification required only fixing as server field in libzmq greeting and adding additional logic for this new option but again i am not zeromq expert so maybe there is something wrong with this solution 
bluca i hope this can wait until monday i do not have access to a windows build environment on weekends 
hi bluca it is a tool that discovers data races using compiler instrumentation and a support library please find details at https clang llvm org docs thread sanitizer threadsanitizer html i use it in my ci to make sure my code is sane there might be rare false positives and it cannot guarantee to discover all data races i took a quick look to the stack traces in the test suite log the good news is that most maybe all issues have their origin in only a few places ypipe hpp 165 ypipe hpp 120 ypipe hpp 81 ypipe hpp 97 ypipe hpp 86 socket base cpp 1388 socket base cpp 343 pipe cpp 413 pipe cpp 217 from a first look to the code i cannot tell much more about the problem from my experience i can tell that those data races most probably are real bugs how can i help to fix them 
vc pkg vcpkg https github com microsoft vcpkg is a package manager for c on windows it can help easily incorporate many different libraries into your projects by compiling them locally it absolutely does use c make cmake i think the issue here is that zmq supports arm and it supports windows but some minor changes are needed to make it support arm on windows which makes sense because it s a relatively new thing here are the files you ve requested from an arm 64 arm64 release build plus another that might be helpful 1 platform hpp https github com zeromq libzmq files platform 2774720platform hpp txt 2 c make output cmakeoutput log https github com zeromq libzmq files c make output 2774726cmakeoutput log 3 c make error cmakeerror log https github com zeromq libzmq files c make error 2774727cmakeerror log to recreate exactly what i did these commands from a windows prompt should get you there make sure you ve got the arm libraries installed in your visual studio 1 git clone https github com microsoft vcpkg 2 cd vcpkg 3 bootstrap vcpkg bat 4 vcpkg install zeromq arm windows arm64windows it will download c make cmake and nuget or whatever it needs

for testing frameworks to work without fuss with transactionless persistence stores they need to simulate a transaction log in order to enable nested roll backs i think something like this http gist github com 318350 what do you think makes sense

i have require capybara rspec line in spec support additional requires rb
i m not sure if an example spec code will provide any more insight debugger when running specs  rails has changed the keys to symbols but r spec rspec is still using the old string keys 
thanks it appears that this is related to rbenv zsh combination command line arguments are not being passed in using the rake shim 
it is because the problem lies with my directory naming tl dr you need to name the integration test directory requests plural i had been naming it request capybara calls config include capybara dsl type request the request symbol causes rspec to only include if the directory is named requests it would be cool if it accepted both but really that doesn matter if a person is ignorant of this arrangement they will still not be able to get capy working there needs to be a neon sign for users to tell them that the name of the directory is critical i don t know whether that s rspec s responsibility or capybara s or google s thanks for all your work on rspec it s good software david heitzman from david chelimsky reply reply github com to david heitzman daveheitzman yahoo com sent thursday february 9 2012 107 pm subject re rspec rails r spec rspec configure not including capybara dsl in spec helper rb 503 why did you close this  reply to this email directly or view it on git hub github https github com rspec rspec rails issues 503 issuecomment 3893446

yes i will add code there to reproduce i think you have wrong gem versions here do you mean rails rc 1 600rc1 and some different version of rspec rails 
i did a global update of my gems on my system and updated the gemfile lock with bundle update it is using rspec rails 2122 and rspec 2122 below is an excerpt of my gemfile lock i find it weird that rspec mocks is not 2122 but 2121 but well 
it doesn t seem to work i hand patched my locally installed action controller actioncontroller template assertions templateassertions with a reference to response body which should start the rendering sequence enough to resolve template lookups and the test still fails  i m not terribly surprised by this as it sort of makes sense that streaming output would be primed with the layout template first and render my designated template later on in the process but it seems like a pretty bad bug or possibly a misunderstanding on my part in the public contract of assert template interestingly with 1 the response body hack in place as well as 2 turning on render views the test will pass i m going to dig a bit more this evening if i have time and post findings here perhaps the rails side of things should be treating streamed results a bit differently 
i have fixed the problem thanks please see discussion here https github com freerange mocha issues 130 issuecomment 12885244
alindeman i have even updated shoulda to 210 but i am still getting the same error ps sorry for delay i was on vacation edit i have added new issue at shoulda matchers https github com thoughtbot shoulda matchers issues 293
alindeman thanks for your reply i think it coused by inherited resources  when i don t use inherited resources works well thanks 
i ve since fixed this with a custom matcher but looking at the code this feels like either i m using a wrong way to test or like something that needs to be ported back i mean it calls valid on the model etc if nothing the error message doesn t take into account this one and the proposed solution is invalid 
here are the old versions that worked 
jon rowe jonrowe yes that actually resolves the issue but in addition i had to set the request headers in the before block rather than passing it as a hash both tricks helped cupakromer yes i did upgrade to 411 but it was few weeks ago the type controller part was added by transpec great thanks for the help i consider the issue resolved 
codeschool thanks 
hi john thank you so much for the support i m getting desperate i did bundle update bundle update rspec rspec rails as requested the error i get now is could not find gem rspec in my gemfile i have gem rspec support  310 gem rspec core  317 gem rspec expectations  312 gem rspec mocks  313 gem rspec rails  310 i have ruby p 95 212p95 rails 416 my local gems are  local gems coffee rails 401 jquery rails 312 rails 416 rspec rails 310 302 sass rails 404 403 sprockets rails 220 214 watir rails 101
that s what i thought as well but my rails helper has that set and the controller spec includes the rails helper properly 
cupakromer the problem is when i set default url options in my spec rails helper rb or environments test rb it s being ignored in feature specs i set like following  but in a feature spec posts url is equal to http www example com posts instead of http lvh me posts 
for features i always generate them independently so i run g rspec feature 
sure thing https github com stefanhendriks rspec invalid option 1356 i can reproduce it without rails rspec so this repo is even smaller i have one old project somewhere using a newer ruby version which somehow works but when using the ruby version and copying the gemfile over and only using the rails and rspec rails gems i still get the error in the new project so somewhere something is different i can t seem to get any clue what calls this test unit stuff 
fair on the models scaffolded code has failure branches for actions like create update and delete that could be written out as well 
works fine with just one argument ie post endpoint or get endpoint here is the stack trace 
i just upgraded it to 224 it was version 223 after a restart of vs 2012 vs2012 and an uninstall install of csv helper csvhelper that fixed the problem thanks a lot and sorry for this message 
seeking the underlying stream is ok for when we start reading the difficulty i was having was determining the point in the stream that we re up to when we ve finished processing the batch the reason is because the stream reader streamreader does its own buffering and the csv parser csvparser also does some buffering so i started by reflecting the buffer position in the csv parser csvparser class and doing some math with the reader underlying stream underlyingstream position but that wasn t always accurate for me next i started reflecting the characters read charactersread field after each read line readline method and keeping a tally but as you can see its not the most elegant solution

nope it appears this csv doesn t quote anything at all don t know what it looks like when confronted with the delimiter in a field 
so i will set encoding in these lines using csv reader csvreader csv new csv reader csvreader new stream reader streamreader full path name fullpathname config   or i will set it in the encoding property of csv configuration csvconfiguration and what kind of encoding will i use utf 32 utf32 utf 8 utf8 etc many thanks mill dol milldol
i m using this settings 
omg i m dumb thank you for pointing me in the direction of my source file please forget about this 
for the created field i m using automap i get the feeling it s something to do with having a uk timezone using a 24 hour clock whilst this is a 12 hour clock 
hi if the limit is exceeded i would like to either throw it as a reading exception or treat it in the reading callback thank you 
for the not null notnull then throw csv missing field exception csvmissingfieldexception for the custom validator perhaps let validator implementation decide it could log or throw 
yeah essentially i have a class with a bunch of derived classes and a lot of the fields are repeated with one or two extra fields in the csv files i read your thread here https groups google com forum topic csvhelper l b l7b j xou lrg jxoulrg url but couldn t figure it out if it was the same thing or not if it can t be done it s really not a big deal i was just wondering if there was support for this 
hi josh thank for the clarification sorry i forgot to put in the version number 2163 just to let you know i have been using quote all fields quoteallfields with this is in visual basic but the configuration section is pretty straight forward sorry for the elaboration just trying to understand the nuance thanks again for taking the time to explain 
in my opinion empty string should be also null empty string is better than null parsed text should never return null by default ps i know that it is not big issue changing current approach can be done in few lines 
sorry forgot to mention it s beta 7 300beta7

ok so basically i am hitting an api that returns movie records and the response contains child records i e movie record multiple contributor records which do no get written to the csv when has header record hasheaderrecord true however when has header record hasheaderrecord false the child records are written to the csv file see attached zip with a sample record for each scenario described csv zip https github com josh close joshclose csv helper csvhelper files csv 1428811csv zip 
i ve got an existing uwp app that i have been writing for a while now my visual studio enterprise 2017 has net framework version 4702556
hi josh i use csvimport for seeding the database  this work now with automap i wanna do this without automap for this i created class map how can i do this without registerclass and automap and only configure my class map best regards
it is always empty i am trying with a sample csv with several date errors the errors are replaced with the default correctly but g map gmap g error parsing errorparsing has no elements i also tried with this 
josh thanks for the quick response it was a rookie mistake of mine i am using your package with https github com filipw dotnet script and i forgot the reference before accessing the package 
yes they did i retested this morning and both are still issues on the current nuget package but are fixed by the commits above with a local build 
i mean both i think a library should not use an other lib which is already included in the net framework 47 with the csv helper we do not get any crashs or something but i think it is not a very clean way however i only open an issue here because i thought it is maybe a solution for removing the useless extra valuetuple package it was the same with the automapper package the guys resolved it some users had problems with the automapper in 47 caused of the valuetuple package 
josh close joshclose i found the fix thanks for the concern 
good ideas i would find this useful 
thanks to your reply i m aware of the tray menu i saw it in the settings but i thought it s the actual menu when clicking the icon in the tray i was using copyq toggle all this time hehe copyq menu is the real thing i don t think the option for same monitor appearance is now necessary you can close issue thanks 1
hluk it works fine now lots logs lots0logs have updated something and copy q copyq 261 is working thanks for your help
i see only this 
i tried several options but i do not know how to import a list from a txt file any tips am i missing something 
strange the tool tip will only appear if the item is selected and then it only appears on the far right the first time you hover if you keep the item selected the tool tip appears just below when you hover for the second and subsequent times the tool tip should appear as close to the icon as possible but if you give it a time limit i e it disappears after a few seconds i don t think it would matter what else it covered perhaps keep it on the same line for the entry if possible 
i have a clear clipboard ini file which i downloaded from here i think loaded into commands global shortcuts we ve communicated on this one before it wasn t working prior to 244 then you fixed it and now it s broken again 
ahh sorry that was my mistake i need to select a previous entry in the clipboard first then only previous will work capture https cloud githubusercontent com assets a c c e c ddde ad jpg 14323166572023a22652c6c73411e49886c6ddde75ad52jpg 
thanks for your reply i mean i would like to use it in every application i use autokey https github com autokey autokey for this feature but it does not support wayland i wonder if you have any opinion about this feature thanks 
i copied the code to a new file snippets ini then in copy q copyq commands i clicked load commands navigated to snippets ini and the program did the rest i disabled the older snippets command so there would be no conflict copy q copyq 350
i just extract all files from the archive into the copy q copyq folder doing this for a long time and never got any issues 
i guess you re right that could create a lot of trouble if you haven t set or don t remember the keyboard shortcut ok just forget about it 
it happened again yesterday st 21st i ve never used item show preview but i just toggled it a fair bit and that opened up a docked window down the bottom i could drag it to get a rd 3rd onscreen window here are recent log events note a separate bug is that copyq doesn t handle windows shutdown reports as crashes i also don t know what clipboard data expiry is  i m on version 392 but that information plus environmental information should be logged when the app starts in fact it doesn t even log when the app starts i found a program called win spy winspy and it tells me the window was  created at pm 50117pm  has class qt q window icon qt5qwindowicon  has style x cf 0000 0x96cf0000 overlapped window

no i had it from source forge sourceforge on feb th 14th for ubuntu 1510 then thank you the copyq ubuntu 261ubuntu amd deb 1604amd64deb from here installs fine shows up in dash but not in the unity bar but obviously it took the settings from the 1510 installation i ll keep that in mind always to go ad fontes thanks again it s a wonderful tool 
i am on manjaro so i installed it from aur however the issue with the shortcut in menu stays moreover the issue with ctrl insert on my systems stays too i ve tried uninstalling deleting config copyq directory and reinstalling again then with clean config adding this action from presets in f 6 f6 menu even this didn t help 
yes i checked it before posting i updated today because i was using one of the earlier versions where pinning didn t work since you say that a similar bug was fixed i m going to uninstall it and install again maybe it s because i updated i hope i don t have to purge my config though reconfiguring all my settings would be a bother 
yes it does happen when i create and copy new items in copy q copyq it doesn t happen with system default copy paste so i think there s definitely an issue we should fix 
certainly seems like the issue i installed with brew cask install copyq good to know that it should work though 
i m running windows 7 bit 64bit and pasting into microsoft word 2013 i just restarted exited and restarted copy q copyq and it s working now i know i did that before i posted the issue anyway sorry for not realizing this sooner rich
it s the latest version this only happens if you move an image from the clipboard hsitory into the clipboard if you copy an image and it is already in the clipboard it will paste properly image https user images githubusercontent com dab cd 25157703740697903dab960049cd ea 11ea e f 8e3f d ddf fddae png d6ddf8fddae1png

hluk thank you for your prompt response i wasn t aware of the nature of file managers with respect to image files however it doesn t work with pix or inkscape svg either but it does work with gimp i don t know whether that is expected behavior edit it also works with ms photos by swap i just mean double clicking on an item other than the currently selected image item then double clicking the previously selected image item to put it back in the clipboard but given the file manager behavior you explained it makes sense that this doesn t work the way i expected it just pastes text

thanks for the hint 
when pressing ctrl r the first element in the current directory is selected thanks for the tip 
yep it is like you said  does ranger set this variable after installing 
this happens with or without tmux even when i m using default configuration after ranger copy config all as for v 181 v181 i did t notice this problem when i m using that old version can t you reproduce it 
thx vifon that s what i am looking for smile 
yah i get what you re saying i ve been playing around with the idea of having a separate script but it would be more convenient and cleaner overall to have it built in also could you elaborate on what you mean by remote code execution i m also curious about the best way to handle installing different plugins since it seems like you would need some sort of spec i guess you could do one of  require plugins to have a makefile with an install and uninstall command copy over all py files in the root of the repo have a plugin folder in the repo with all plugin files require a text file in the plugin repo listing all the files that should be copied over that might be something to standardize and include in the wiki idk 
toonn yes if i kill it with a signal it also happens also i don t have anything to open images with by default and if i press l to open an image the same thing happens 
toonn i was wrong i must have done something else that made it start working furthermore only images are now previewed text and other text based files are not being previewed any ideas 
yes i am using w m w3m i only tried urxvt method because w m w3m wasn t working image previews are fine just expansion doesn t work disabling transparency doesn t seem to help either would you like to see my configs 
tried xterm still blinks 
thanks toonn i ran rm config ranger and now it simply triggers open with what s the recommended way to tell ranger to open image files in preview on mac os macos 
this doesn t happen in xterm so it s something to do with alacritty handling the mouse on linux mouse interactions seem to work in vim though should i file a bug against alacritty as well on sun mar 24 2019 247 pm toon nolten notifications github com wrote 
yes its true when i disable my previews with zp then it does not freeze 
toonn fails the same way 
in the statusbar and in any build in status line that shows date and or time right now it is using iso date and 24 hours clock i am in north america canada where our date and time format is mm dd yyyy and 12 hour clock 
just compiled v 193 v193 and get the same crash as above also open with key r no longer works 
toonn thanks for reply here is output of tmux show option gw 
i use tmux but tmux conf no set preview view max size when i detach the tmux client still only preview less than k 100k
yep its repeatable i test with urxvt terminal and en en utf 8 no changes i don t know if python problem 
i found fix i ve added this to scope sh to function handle image 
we re not requiring json or json pure anywhere in our app here s our ruby version

returin nil would be just fine main thing all providers should behave consistently get not existing  nil nil is semantically the correct answer what do you get requesting that doesn t exist  nil what do you get when the request itself fails a failure so i absolutely agree 
looks like i could ve dug into this issue just a liiiittle bit further the only situation where i have leading slashes is when i m parsing apart a s 3 s3 url from a third party and that s just a side effect of my parsing it looks like paperclip s paths don t have leading slashes i m not sure how forgiving you want to make fog here but personally i d be happy saying that i should be responsible for stripping the slash when pulling apart the s 3 s3 url 
when i try this on cloudstack i get an api error it s likely that the reason for this is that project id is not set the cloudstack stuff doesn t like any methods that don t include that parameter p 545 193p545 107 server wait for ready  fog json decode error decodeerror 795 unexpected token at not an allowed api call 
i m able to run put object and delete object without error so it looks like it s unique to the directories method and excon seems to work fine when used by itself https gist github com 977486
geemus i d say take care of it in fog if people are handling it with a gsub it shouldn t matter anyway  i ll work on a change 
yes you are right maybe it would be best to just rescue http status error httpstatuserror because we can be sure they have a response method and let a socket error socketerror bubble up i will try the current master and see what the error exactly is 
please you do not have to apologize for asking for information to help me here s the backtrace 
geemus my mistake the file watcher was not running i do see the threading in the tests method https github com fog fog blob master rakefile l 65 l65 editing issue 
os x local server it s a french computer btw
this is with debug 
i m not sure what you mean by pass in a hash here is some code to illustrate the issue more clearly this is what happens with the current code when getting a server  the db security groups attribute can be left as is so users have access to the array of hashes 
updated the first paragraph of my comment i think the problem is that even setting name as a variable with a default value still won t help since the developer using fog may not know what the admin in open stack openstack named the networks patch is forthcoming
geemus i m just coming up to speed on vcloud i think it could be an acceptable limitation but should be documented if there is more than one vm it is hard to tell which vapp template to get they might always be the same i don t know enough to say 
in terms filehandling we did not change anything the last change beeing the awesome move to fog 3 month ago i know it might be hard to spot such errors and i also put it here to see if others have similar issues so dont hang this too high we have lots of small kb 50100kb pdf files in case of those empty downloaded files i changed the handling from
yep i would expect it to spin on s 404s but re raise other errors like s 403s or s 401s not that a 401 really makes sense in this context but it should be non transient s 500s are a bit harder to judge since it might not be obvious if it is a transient error or not

at the moment i didn t managed to correctly configure rspec dev so i cannot attach a test for my fix 
ruby dev 192dev 20090718 trunk 24186 i darwin 1040 i386darwin1040 rspec beta 200beta 16 the regex is looking for failed whereas my output says failure
my library is a code generator and i need to make sure to clear out the results of previous tests before anything happens for the next test thinking about it another way i could use an after each block though that means i d have to turn that off if i needed to inspect the results of the test after a failure how much work would it be to simply have the config before each be added to the chain first and after added to the chain last instead of last 
i am fine with that is that supposed to be working currently 
good thinking i just tried it it s the same behavior i have to cgi encode from the test in order to not have special symbols probably too mess up the route matching and the data is still encoded in may controllers params hash so it s not an rspec problem closing this ticket might it be a rails bug am i missing something obvious 
bundle exec rspec spec models some spec rb or rspec spec models some spec rb 
is it i thought the metadata is just for defining some extra information that s queryable during runtime i ve reread the documentation about user defined metadata maybe my reading skills are failing me today but i don t see anything that mentions user defined metadata would modify the way r spec rspec runs shared examples 
this should be able to reproduce the bug tested on jruby 164 ruby p 330 187p330 20110823 ea 768 17ea768 open jdk openjdk bit 64bit server vm ea 170ea darwin x java x8664java works both on the standard jdk 6 and the ea 
david thanks for quick response our application is a functional testing ide http testwisely com en testwise r spec rspec is the core framework used in test scripts one of most used feature is to run the test case where the cursor is like below run test at line http testwisely com images manual editor context run test case png in other words we pass line numbers to r spec rspec to run difference test cases this works fine with r spec rspec 1112 now we are trying to upgrade to r spec rspec 2
oh sorry we are running 2120 and are using capybara 113 please point me in the right direction if this is not an issue with rspec 
no we have r spec rspec configure set to exclude slow so the command line isn t being built into the correct args because the slow tag is still being excluded i ll put together a sample app shortly 
this should result in the mentioned warning we had this problem when a git diff was merged wrong so the nd 2nd shared example ended up within the st 1st 
the dash in erb means no line break if dash is at the erb tag opening then no line break before the code if at end not line break after so in the previous example if test fails it produces one line instead of two empty line one line another option if test succeeds it produces two line instead of four with two empty st 1st and rd 3rd 
i m trying to build a minimal test app so far the issue seems to go away if i get rid of capybara still not totally sure 
myronmarston i figured it out see here https github com mbj mutant blob flexible rspec lib mutant strategy rspec rb l l 24 l17l24 and here https github com mbj mutant blob flexible rspec lib mutant killer rspec rb still not perfect but significantly faster than before closing issue 
myronmarston no problem moved to https github com rspec rspec mocks issues 696

ok guys this is the deal or what i think is the deal i have a large java application that i m testing using jruby rspec it seems that there s an object which spins up additional threads and maybe even a swing component in the background i was attempting to add a piece of new functionality to some legacy section of code this additional thread or whatever it is keeps hanging out and never returns so that particular example never completes if i force an exit 0 the example does complete with a failed status it doesn t really seem like anything to do with rspec after all any tricks you could think of to force an exit without auto failing the example 
cupakromer i ll try that and give you some feedback once possible thanks
i had a few rails specs where herp was creating records and subject was reading the records with the change subject would read the records before they were created 
thanks for leading me in the right direction apparently created a rspec file in my root that had my nerd tree nerdtree menu pasted into it thats what i get for trying to learn vim deleted the rspec and everything works again 
thanks jon rowe jonrowe too bad ruby doesn t have private classes vendoring could create other trouble i ve not had good luck with it in the past maintenance headaches myronmarston thanks for the offer i m not sure what the design choices were for this that necessitated the monkeypatching i ll ask the project maintainer to pitch in here 
the file gets created but nothing gets written to it i ll attach a tiny project archive it has a rspec file so you can just run rspecproblem zip https github com rspec rspec core files rspecproblem 187179rspecproblem zip 
thank you yes everything makes sense i should have just left this on stackoverflow longer but i got no responses even comments so i thought it s a bug and i kinda forgot i put subject add in before block that was experiment attempting to reduce size of specs which worked for first several specs definitively not an rspec issue 
i have a bunch of tests that i would like to run as a prerequisite to other actions e g on startup run these tests before saying you are healthy on certain specs i do not want failures to stop the entire process i could say at exit exit 0 but then all specs exit with 0 and important ones that fail do not stop the process the way i m currently getting around this is by moving specs that are nonblocking when failing to a new file and adding the at exit exit 0 but now i have very relevant specs split up between two files i am a very big fan of the rspec dsl and would like to use it as a form of live integration testing in production and this is at least one use case for the similar feature

there is no network filesystems however cygwin is much slower for accessing files then linux most noticeable when i try to complete filename in a shell in linux it is very fast however in cygwin it can be slow especially when the path i m trying to complete is long and nested so i m betting on s detect and inside s extract git dir extractgitdir i can try to trace it somehow if you tell me how thus you can treat this issue more as a feature request for explicit turning on of fugitive e g  i ll have g fugitive manual git dir set to true fugitive will detect this and will not try to figure out the git dir for every new file using help is also slow however once set manually it will work as usual 
worth noting also that users john sites symble frontend symblefrontend does not have a git directory  edit also worth noting that removing the fugitive directory from my bundles dir fixes the problem 
for the first command i get  but i found something funny if i open any directory including the home directory of the git repository the git status shows up in the status bar i use set statusline fugitive statusline but just opening the file i do not get the status here is the link to my vimrc https dl dropboxusercontent com u vimrc 1729951vimrc just in case 
script 12 is vim ant https github com teneighty vim ant i have tried removing it and cleaning the bundles and now everything works fine is there a possible fix for this or should i raise an issue on the vim ant repository thanks for getting back to me so quickly 1
in my full vimrc i do have a browse command however in the minimal vimrc posted above i don t have such command i really don t understand why i get the e 14 e14 invalid address error 
nothing at all tired leader gx as well as gx and while not in edit mode gx on the line itself 
probably my former message wasn t clear glog follow is working and i get an entry in the quickfix list with the revision i want to check but when i try to open that revision pressing enter on the quickfix window i get that error the only difference between revisions i can open and those i can t is whether they are after before the renaming of the file 
even for a repo that isn t sitting on a drive i was having the same result as of right this moment it is not happening anymore so i can t tell you how fast git status is by comparison from what i remember running git status in the cmd line without vim was just fine and snappy 
that s all the error message that appears in vim s error bar doing a git commit amend from the command line under the same circumstances gives this text exactly 
yes when i git status i get the expected output from the command line to add to this i can run other commands such as gblame which behave as expected so far it just seems to be gstatus it s very possible an issue with my shell config as i am still very green in the world of vim 
indeed kbd kbd does the trick thank you justinmk but it was not obvious that kbd kbd mapped to this behaviour at least for me do you think it is worth remapping to kbd u kbd 
it will also discard unstaged changes as opposed to git reset hard head which will only discard staged changes 
it s been a little while since i installed it but it was likely through https git scm com downloads how can i check to see if there s some sort of conflict something may have installed incorrectly on my system because even running git commit a from the terminal throws a strange error  so this may just be on my end altogether i m going to reinstall git via that link and see if that helps edit going to git 225 from 224 initially didn t seem to help but then using cmd instead of the terminal told me the index lock file existed which i went to delete using the terminal rm git index lock which told me that rm was missing an operand so using usr bin rm git index lock worked to delete the file then both cmd and the terminal s git commit a command worked again but the gcommit command did not image https user images githubusercontent com c e e ea 13123907448387266c49e804e8511ea dcb png 84410dcb02015064png 
the file path i m editing is c users user name username path to repo the file name i m not using wsl i m using msys 2 msys2 and pacman the package manager provided by msys 2 msys2 and i tried more commands and find the result is interesting  there is nothing mentions a function name or a script path i think the mistake is happened in the steps to get a path and the exceptions is thrown when executing some system call like cd on this bad path maybe the file path generating logic not works well when we use native vim and msys 2 msys2 git at the same time 
it fails on first call gcommit m message does not work
yup naturally as i create the issue i find the issue being a pre commit hook bug sorry for wasting your time 
tpope cheers for the quick response that works way better for me 1 is there a location for all the options for fugitive 
i m seeing the weird scrolling behavior in all windows that are alone in a tab not just those created by fugitive commands verbose nmap c f outputs no mapping found both verbose set window and verbose set window output window 4

i will ask the deployer
hi robbie the rtl css should be loaded after the other css files are loaded there should be one for the admin panel and a separate one for each theme the file should be loaded only if a rtl language is selected this will enable me to make modifications to the rtl css file that will be or mostly be forward compatible thank you very much for looking into this once it is implemented i will be happy to do my best at adjusting the rtl of the admin and the main theme 
great thank you i will probably get to check it on my deployment during the weekend

i use  in the names of identificator fields in this situation i can rename fields in database because project only started jdeveloper replace  with when generates jpa entities but i think better to strip them from the name 
currently i have no idea how that could be better however i think maybe it s better to have always compiled queries except the user explicitly wan t non compiled that would be an option i mean slick already had a huge gain by introducing sql sqlu tsql and future responses now if it would be less painfull to have fast queries it would be the greatest orm like library i mean without compiled queries people get performance hits by more than ms 510ms which is huge really huge the tables filter query is 5 ms slower than the corresponding sql select from tables where id id even when you need to manually map the response to the correct case class which takes more lines to write 
currently the query that will be generated is  the result is correct it s just that the query is way slower due to the subquery 
ah no that would do it i didn t see that anywhere is there a doc somewhere 
hmm i am going to look
yeah i think so
is there any instruction on this i m very new to slick 
itaross i just quickly tried that change but this is the result of removing auto increment autoincrement false from postgres profile postgresprofile  i ll try to have another more in depth look but it would help for maintainers to give us hints on this if they know what s up off the top of their head 
nice orenyk i think i m on the right path that s great this is exactly what i was searching this kind of oportunitty doesn t happen a lot thanks i ll be in touch 
yes for the last element this is what i would like to get label input type text name cart item value i class my minus icon i label the simple case is this one what if i need to place items icons images spans etc before and or after each collection item does that make sense to you

i have update rails but the bug is still there on the other hand i failed to reproduce the bug into an empty rails application created with rails 305 thanks for your help i will keep you up to date 
your suggestion works fine sure it could be a little cleaner but it works 
rails beta 1 310beta1 and simple form 131
yeah specifically being able to effectively use the checked span or similar css selector to bold selected text and to otherwise specifically style the text immediately following a check box i ve got a fix for it that passes all the tests and a couple new ones i wrote that i ll be sending a push request for shortly my first such attempt on github so far so be gentle if i do something wrong 
yeah thats it im using the gem so it s pulling 152 if i pointed it to 20 is 20 ready for use

the rendered html is this  i ve tested it out further on multiple browsers and found it works in some cases and fails in others it works ok in firefox windows chrome v 180102554 v180102554 beta m and even ie 9 ie9 meaning there isn t a leading line break in the textarea it fails in safari v 513 v513 os x v 512 v512 windows and os x chrome v 17096378 v17096378 producing a leading line break where the content is on the second row of the textarea in all cases the x a x000a is rendered to the source but it must be ignored in the browsers where it works ok 
carlos my concern was that something went wrong with my simple form bootstrap install because inline forms should work properly with simple form i do realize that this is silly because i don t need a simple form for this basic form but it s just an example for the forum thanks for your help though i will probably just revert to non simple form for now thanks abram
yes your re right but anyway can simple form do this 
using 202 just tried it again and it does work i must have been stuffing something up for couple of days i can t seem to reproduce it on my side so i ll just close my apologies for the wasted time

you re right i just tested with a pure form for and i get the same issue i guess it s a rails issue then sorry
however this line of code solves my problem i d really like the html 5 html5 validation code config browser validations false code so i prefer then using jquery rails 202 instead of 211 moreover i disabled all validations so the code require code didn t appear anywhere i still couldn t submit the form 
i am sorry i ll repost this to the mailing list

hmm it s working now not sure exactly what happened bundle update simple form did not change gemfile lock when i just did it i was under the impression that since i changed the simple form line in my gemfile to get it from github rather than just get it from the gem server a simple bundle install was sufficient perhaps not but anyway it s working now thanks

carlosantoniodasilva my case i am building a fake input container where labels are fake placeholders with absolute positioning so when wrappers have has value class fake placeholders will be hidden another example is styling from group when it is completed or something like this

i updated to latest 302 i ve been using it for 6 months always have this problem tried every combination but no luck my slightly nasty work around is this b use label wrap with  tag div class my label input class  which adds an extra div that i can apply the class i ve noticed this issue in other threads also e g  880 but it was never fixed

thanks so much
oops my mistake please ignore posted in wrong window project
carlosantoniodasilva nice catch  it was exactly that i still don t have the reflex to check it first after adding a new attribute to the model thank you guys 
yep seems like it was reported at the same time thanks for the response i ve got the same vconfig as jason it seems on wed mar 16 2011 at am 043813am 0700 jodal wrote

hi jodal sure thing 
hello i thought after somes researches that it was not really relevant for your project i was wrong on 050614 1926 stein magnus jodal wrote 
sorry forgot that one added it to the post 
i run mopidy on a rasberry pi rasberrypi b with raspbian fresh installed and uptodate 
these are local files json
yes that s correct mopidy 105 running mopidy deps  in aforementioned configuration yes although i have tested only a few mp 3 mp3 tracks curiously i ve got mopidy on rpi and cannot reproduce this error 
no problem for those interested here is the link https discuss mopidy com t no items in library 806
oh thank you missed that one it works now 
you completely right about the http 2 part how ever my use case is to control my music source control via internet as i want to be able to change view those things remotely but i can put nginx in front that can solve it also 
mopidy spotify doesn t appear to be compatible yet 
may be
kingosticks i will and i will update the bug when i ca thanks
ah my mistake it seems it s a dependency of sphinx which is used to generate the documentation has nothing to do with mopidy sorry wink 
hi jeremy what i am trying to ask is when doing validation are we able to access the current http context object in web api webapi 2 the context object by what i mean is  cheers jing
that makes sense and i can definitely get behind most of that argument but i still feel like it reduces the power of the set validator setvalidator even though the full property name is passed back with any validation failures it s awkward to adjust any display messages to include it because the majority of the validation context is already gone originally i was overriding the validation failures validationfailures to string tostring to adjust the messages accordingly but obviously this approach ends up covering all the returned validation failures and not just the ones with complex property chains the tech lead for the project vetoed that approach i thought it was acceptable the second approach i took which i think is a bit better was to modify my validator class to contain the parent s property name  there are a few obvious drawbacks from a maintenance po v pov but the code itself is very clear at least i think a better approach to this would be modifying the display name resolver displaynameresolver to include the property chain similar to how the property name resolver propertynameresolver functions on validation objects that need it but i don t think this would work due to validator options validatoroptions being a globally shared class across all validators maybe you could set the resolver to suit the needs of each validator but that seems like a messy way to make validator options validatoroptions property name resolver propertynameresolver associated with individual validators rather than exist as a global options object
hi it was something like this  how can i debug it to figure out what is happening 
sure nice response time 
no it s pretty much what i ve shown already one single outer object with a property that is a collection of objects the validation message returned to the user of the api can contain multiple email cannot be empty messages and it s hard for the user to find the right user missing an email address  so two riddles really 1 why are we not getting the user email 0email should not be empty type of message 2 what can be done with expression and memberinfo to get hold of the current users name
how you can create the validator as a single product how i can activate the cache validator level this is the head of my validator public class my class validator myclassvalidator abstract validator abstractvalidator my class view model myclassviewmodel 
how i can convert the following rule to asynchronous rule for rulefor t t name must this validate unique name validateuniquename with message withmessage name duplicated private bool validate unique name validateuniquename my view model myviewmodel string new name newname  var is unique isunique repeated any return is unique isunique 
hmm it is a solution that could work but i think it would be cleaner if fluent validation fluentvalidation would support this because the object against context logic would remain in fluent validation fluentvalidation with your proposal validation logic is leaking outside fluent validation fluentvalidation with creating the custom person and context personandcontext object what is your vision about this

so to achieve the desired effect i d have make my own validator that derives from property validator propertyvalidator and use that to create my validation failure validationfailure instead of doing new validation failure validationfailure is that understood correctly

i will wait to see the answer to the issue i posted at the asp net core repository and will decide if i will have to manually validate the view model thank you for the help jeremy 
it will looks something like this code snippet the validators will utilize a scoped lifetime and will be able to share the same db context dbcontext with all the validators within the same http request when is deferred valid async isdeferredvalidasync is first called we can use the future feature as seen in ef plus this helps to consolidate the queries into a single network call to the database while keeping the validators simple ultimately this means that every http request will only make 1 sql call to retrieve information from the database

hi david sorry i wasn t aware of these guidelines i am quite new to web development and javascript i made a test case hopefully this suffices if not please let me know what other info you need http codepen io anon pen zv m obr zvmobr i just had to add this to the js file 
i ve seen that my problem description above was a little bit confusing so i rephrased it i reproduced the problem in this codepen http codepen io gerryxx pen j wp lbo jwplbo 
desandro thank you for the fast answer i ve read the guideluines but it s hard for me impossible to reproduce this in codepen and i cannot publish a pre version of the clients website but you should get an idea of what s breaking if you have a look at the code i m loading a new page into my website via ajax in this new page there are my masonry containers and i m initiating masonry in ajax success function so the dom edits should be loaded already but then this happens the margin bottom value is being ignored so no vertical gutter exists if i init the masonry function with a timeout of let s say 1 second it s working but thats a buggy version of fixing this do you have any idea what to do i m wondering why nobody else had this problem before thank s a lot in advance 
as mentioned in the http stackoverflow com questions dynamically 23769642dynamically loaded masonry images are overlapping i have the same issue when i resize my page everything looks fine i have tried various solutions but still haven t gotten it working properly js grid images loaded imagesloaded function item selector itemselector grid item grid masonry is fit width isfitwidth true is animated isanimated true

issue resolved it was caused by the rd 3rd line var msnry 1 msnry1 new masonry container  replaced container var by masonry and all went smooth

sorry for taking so long to respond i ve done some more measurements outside of my program and i will say that even with a kb 50kb html which i would count as big you basically don t see the difference patch or not my idea was that the key is when the application is under memory pressure on android devices have from 12 to mb 32mb max heap size so you quickly reach that limit so if the program is under memory pressure from something else the extra overhead from this gc churn could theoretically slow down the application obviously when i submitted the patch i suspected you might ask me about measurements the reason i didn t include them is that it s hard to reproduce also i was hoping you had some test suite that could help you to reproduce yourself now i have modified my application to reduce its memory use so i can t reproduce the problem which was far from happening all the time anyway also i can t make a reliable measurement that would prove it s worth it so at this point i would say that the new code is probably better but you must probably hit a very specific situation for the difference to be measurable given the use case of jsoup the difference from that patch is probably in all but very strange cases impossible to measure compared to the network latency i have made a couple of test programs both ran on my htc desire 22 1 load in memory over 500 times the icon of the application to reach almost out of memory then parse the html from http lwn net articles bigpage 454305bigpage five times and time it no major difference patch or not 2 start parsing that same webpage in three different threads concurrently and 3 times in a row in each thread and measure it there i got minor differences but i think not worth mentioning unpatched 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43383 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43911 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 44041 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43629 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 44137 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43488 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43517 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 44042 0819 151345736 debug jsouptest 24018 parse duration ms 43741 patched 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 42468 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41756 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41303 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 42226 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41634 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41512 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 42369 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41779 0819 151754286 debug jsouptest 24071 parse duration ms 41146 could easily be noise from the other processes running on the phone note the measurements are printed in random order note that of course i m measuring only the parsing not the fetching connection connection jsoup connect http lwn net articles bigpage 454305bigpage connection timeout connection timeout ms response response connection execute long now calendar get instance getinstance get time in millis gettimeinmillis response parse long now 2 now2 calendar get instance getinstance get time in millis gettimeinmillis so i think in the end if you consider that the patch makes the code less readable which i probably does just reject it i regret opening this bug now without having measured and proven to myself that it does make a measurable difference

thank for your comment i m not suggesting that j soup jsoup should absolutely adhere to the spec whaver it says i think we all know from experience that specs are not always right and sometimes we must go sideways br however i consider that j soup jsoup should ensure that the html or xhtml output is always valid clean if requested and above all compatible with the most common parser browser and unfortunately ie 8 ie8 is one of them br and if it is not in its standard configuration which i would understand for backward compatibilty issues even though it s not what i would choose it should probably be nice to provide the api to ease custom configuration as requested in 163 my suggestion would be to always output amp 39 when using escape mode escapemode xhtml instead of existing apos entity apos would still be valid when parsed of course the following commit is a fix for this issue that i think is proper behavior e c fdeda c a c e fe c bf 4e59c908fdeda9032c5a14c7e934fe26c08438bf my apologize for not submitting a pull request i m not yet familar enough with github

yeah that would be nice these days almost every site has strange javascript stuff responsible for the most strange things and sometimes you simply cant extract the data you need without getting dirty inside the script blocks a selector like this would atleast allow me to get the block i know contains the keywords im interested in so i dont have to loop over many handful of script blocks that does not contain the things 
so i can put directly into my build gradle compile how to do it

the affected pages change for the website i m working with since new content is posted daily also it seems like they are not tied to specific items in the rss feed meaning that if an items moves from page x to page x 1 and page x was affected page x 1 won t necessarily be affected i ve just added a public method that prints all affected pages as they re found another curious thing i ve forgot to mention is that whether a page is affected or not changes based on if the url supplied to jsoup connect has a trailing slash or not

hi normal open ssh to the switch through command directly works well suspect you need a try except block you mean i may try pass the error block minimal code here s the code in paramiko channel py def wait for event self self event wait assert self event is set if self event ready return e self transport get exception if e is none e ssh exception sshexception channel closed raise e if it s not the code u want plz let me know thanks for your help

sorry about the late reply bitprophet here s some more detail on what i m seeing i have this block of code https github com nchammas flintrock blob e d a c b dd dfe d ef flintrock 1e15d1a7345c508b258994dd1dfe8101484d2ef6flintrock ssh py l l 84 l63l84 which i use to try connecting to an ec 2 ec2 instance as it comes up  it doesn t look like from the traceback that i am actually catching the socket error but even if i was i would immediately re raise the exception because errno has a different value whereas in 1154 the errno was set to econnrefused in 201 it is set to none perhaps this is a bug 
one of the server s version number was manually changed from open ssh openssh 62 to open ssh openssh 68 for some reason after reverting back everything s ok now the other one was probably for some similar reason it will be appreciated if you could point me the way to do some test or monkey patch to determine what caused this problem on the other server 
thanks for your responses making it configurable or more granular in exception handling would of course be the most flexible solution but i realize that it is also far more work than just relegating the stack trace log to debug i see your point that the ssh exception sshexception is rather general but i would still argue that the traceback log adds very little relevant information except in a non production debug environment one would still get the error log of the actual exception right before the traceback anyway it s your decision of course and i just manually patch our production installations for now 
 here s a branch https github com refinery platform django docker engine compare mccalluc zoom in on paramiko connect expand 1 where i was trying to narrow down the problem and again i apologize for not understanding the exact conditions necessary  i was just giving it an ip so not a name resolution issue and in other contexts paramiko has worked fine for me with i ps ips  in my last stab at debugging i added multiple retries in the code and after the last of them used subprocess and ssh so the remote server is up  my subprocess call looks like  thanks i m sorry that i do not to have a clean minimal reproducer and if there s nothing here that would be useful to anyone feel free to go ahead and close i think i was hoping that it would ring a bell as something that someone else had struck before and either resolved or had trouble reproducing in which case this might be another data point i doubt that s the case sorry for the bother

integers work ok in couch db couchdb 211 single node with 8 shards out of curiosity i did some tests in js engine used by chrome 01020102 e 27755575615628914e 17 01020102 e 27755575615628914e 17 other combinations 0 which are exact results from my test case i don t really know how couch db couchdb internally works but i think it reads aggregates from shards and then calculates final aggregate that would explain this issue if shards results are returned in random order but it looks that in cloudant they are always returned in the same order making the result the same across multiple requests 
there is no x server running on the machine running couchdb i ll start it again in a tmux session and see what happens the crash dump is mo 330mo i ll post it somewhere and add the link here after 
i base 64 base64 encoded the file as a text file then did the put with application text and it was worse 1 minute 29 seconds so this is a mb 10mb text file that now takes 1 min 29 seconds to put

kirs updated comment sorry my comment was lost 
yeah sure btw look at my pull request it may be the fix capfile 
sponomarev can you suggest a better way leehambley well in order to get the web root directory behave like a fully functional git repository this was the solution that i found it is very important to our deployment process to be able to access the repo in a normal non archived state i just think it may be useful to have an option to be able to enable or disable this type of feature do you guys believe otherwise 
ok i feel like a moron i was totally missing a capfile thank you 
leehambley yes you re right about the multiple implementations and a simple patch do the trick not sure this option has it place into the capistrano core mattbrictson this way seems to be the good one but i don t really see how to use the map command the documentation indicates how to add prefix but not an option should i do something like this ssh kit sshkit config command map rm  rm one file system in one of the capistrano config file 
 ruby generate keys rb ruby sign update rb app zip dsa priv pem then i use ls l app zip to check the dimension of the file to fill the length field in the appcast xml xcode console error  after the download of the update is completed sparkle error the update is improperly signed i don t have any log in libray folder and as i said before i also tried using feeder so i m not sure what problem can be maybe some problem when i generate the keys 
i m talking about building 
the production url that is still on the server the debug url no longer is the update fails failed on my development machine on a different machine the update worked fine somewhere on my system the debug and defunct url is stored and the old version of sparkle uses that instead of what is in its own info plist 
no we don t have ls file quarantine enabled lsfilequarantineenabled key in our info plist file is this the one you are talking about 
thanks for the reply guys i was already doing everything you mentioned but the problem was something else found it and solved it just in case anybody else face this problem it was because i was using mac ports macports openssl i modified sign update rb and generate keys rb and configured them to use the other version of openssl in usr bin so now i can use the updater without problems i m trying to configure it for silent updates though again thanks for your time and support on tue mar 4 2014 at 1214 am dave mtb davemtb notifications github com wrote 
unfortunately i don t see any log messages from sparkle i placed a breakpoint in ns object nsobject ns key value observer registration nskeyvalueobserverregistration add observer addobserver for key path forkeypath options context and the only observer before the crash is the su updater suupdater object which registers itself in su updater suupdater register as observer registerasobserver for the following key paths values su scheduled check interval suscheduledcheckinterval values su enable automatic checks suenableautomaticchecks maybe there s a lifetime issue which leads to exc bad access 
sorry i started a new gig and all they left me with on this is the following instructions  git clone https github com sparkle project sparkle git  cd sparkle  make they use this app on an mac os macos app and i am suppose to use it to sign the package i really appreciate the quick response and all the help 
i have no way to measure traffic or to differentiate between users who are being prompted to update but choose not to the metrics that i am referring to is a users table which gets updated bases on user activity based on that i am being able to see that are lots of users which did not update for 1 week but are active there may be users who dismiss the update but i doubt that all of them did so since i noticed the su last check time sulastchecktime issues above also based on this i noticed that there are users that updated but i am not able to figure out if the update dialog came from a periodic check so my conclusion remains the same for some reasons the scheduled check for updates fails to work properly

the fact that my project stops compiling once i add sparkle framework to it for example and that is after following all of the steps below number 1 on this page https github com sparkle project sparkle wiki
i got the source of the failure to extract the new version from the patch figured out eventually i d prepared patches that had the app contained in a directory doh  i figured it out by attaching a debugger and stepping through the delta unarchiver calls however the reason i opened this issue is more that it would be very helpful if sparkle logged some more diagnostics out such as the hash mismatch that helped me figure out that i should try applying the patches by hand again once more to replicate exactly what was being done by sparkle the output of that unarchiver seems to not be logged into either system log or the sparkle update sparkleupdate log the delta unarchiver does make a bunch of fprintf calls directed to stderr i wonder where its stderr gets redirected 
we currently are using an in house custom version of sparkle so creating a pull request from that isn t possible not sure when i ll have time to look at the official branch thus the bug report 
sure bud 
hi pornel the only on first time situation appeared to be a red herring it was related to the last checked time in the user defaults and the minimum check interval time we want to manually trigger all of our update checks so i have currently fixed the problem but setting a very large su scheduled check interval suscheduledcheckinterval is there a way to completely disable automatic checking based on examining the su updater suupdater file i see that i could possibly set su enable automatic checks suenableautomaticchecks to no or set su scheduled check interval suscheduledcheckinterval to 0 taking advantage of the automatically checks for updates automaticallychecksforupdates method however when i set su enable automatic checks suenableautomaticchecks to no it triggers a prompt asking the user if the application should automatically check for updates which is not desired for our user experience is it correct for me to set the su scheduled check interval suscheduledcheckinterval to 0 or is there another way to completely disabled sparkle s interval based update check thank you for all the help 
i could nick up a few ideas i d love to see it embedded into the app as a percentage bar on aug 12 2017 1140 0100 christian tietze notifications github com wrote

no it had this i ll change it to 10 and retry  which do have two different signatures and even have two different files specified but they re both listed as version 10
this speculation of mine was wrong it is true i couldn t set k sec attr protocol ksecattrprotocol but k sec attr protocol ksecattrprotocol is meaningless ignored on generic passwords like the one sparkle uses to store the ed 25519 ed25519 private key see 1448
i expect that if i delete the limit it should default to or another fixed number then you should have a more button to show you all possible values if there are more than 10 2 reasons for that 1 it doesn t make any sense not to show the more button when there are more possible values 2 if not writing a limit defaults to writing limit 10 it should act like when writing limit 10 right now if i write no limit or write limit 10 i get different results no limit won t render the more button 
i can but it looks like blacklight doesn t display those collations anyway 2029 so i m going to hold off for now

i feel dumb now yes the yesod packages were broken because i had tried to install snap and they don t like each other thanks 
yes that seems to work it would still be nice if it worked automatically or it was documnented somewhere 
changing the value true to true did the trick yesod does not try to migrate the default value anymore however i experimented with a text field i added a new field language to user table  snip user ident text password text maybe authorized bool default true language text default fi unique user uniqueuser ident snip the initial migration works as expected starting devel application devel application launched http localhost 3000 migrating alter table user add column language varchar not null default fi however on subsequent executions the default value is migrated again starting devel application devel application launched http localhost 3000 migrating alter table user alter column language set default fi the postgre sql postgresql schema is following id integer not null default nextval user id seq regclass ident character varying not null password character varying authorized boolean not null default true language character varying not null default fi character varying it does not seem to be possible to specify fi character varying as the default value due to the white space any ideas on how i could specify a default value for a text field without repeated database migrations upon startup 
yeah it works confirmed 
the only other reason i can think of as a possible reason for the infinite redirect is that i don t have an approot in my settings yml i also saw the configuration above in a relatively official seeming source can t remember where exactly though recommended for enforcing the leading www i ll write again in this issue when i ve created the wiki page sometime in the next few days 
see the details in the other thread i cross referenced https github com mozilla browserid issues 2718 they are saying that get is deprecated either persona needs to fix things to make get work more like people would expect or things need to be clarified that it is deprecated or that it has certain limited function which is not what it was before i don t know enough to judge the situation but you can look at my other ticket and figure out what to do thanks

thanks it still eats a surprising amount of memory but now at least it s tractable i wonder if this is related to the ghc bug where it eats huge amounts of memory in the presence of more that a few kilobytes of data in literals in a single module unfortunately with static files list staticfileslist our web programmers now need to edit a haskell module every time they make any changes to the static directory it would be nice to have a version of static files staticfiles that also takes an exclude list parameter 
thanks for the help 1261 really resolved it 
oh i m sorry michael i have not mush spare time for my yesod based pet project i think it should work

i ll tell you a generic version of my situation i used url render override urlrenderoverride to set the static r staticr base url to be static domain com and the website is served under www domain com i have multiple js files in the static scripts directory that are included using add script attrs addscriptattrs and then i have a julius file that is generating a script with some values inserted in one of the js scripts i have something similar to the following code  since the generated script tag has the domain static domain com without the crossorigin tag it would receive the message script error for every js error that occurred that wasn t blessed via the access control allow origin  header being returned when requesting the script the only way to have the wai cors cors middleware http hackage haskell org package wai cors docs 025docs network wai middleware cors html v simple cors simplecors actually add that header is to have the origin request header set which in chrome seems to only be set when it is a completely different domain or if you have the crossorigin attribute set since i m merely using a subdomain i would need to set the crossorigin attribute so that the origin request header is set which then causes access control allow origin response header to be returned and i am able to receive the actual js error instead of the generic message i m still rather new to this so if there is something i am misunderstanding i d happily make adjustments but having the crossorigin attribute does make things work as a side note having the crossorigin attribute set makes it so it doesn t send cookies etc which can help decrease the payload 
unexpectedly is probably not fair but it s not intuitive if i am not holding anyone else up from taking a stab i could give it a go sure 
yep windows that ticket is only to add some better diagnostics for segfaults which would help but not fix it

that will work for chrome which sends a header and other browsers but unfortunately won t work for safari because safari doesn t appear to to send a header to distinguish a prefetch preload request from a proper user driven request not sure this is solvable just thought i d post in case there was a known workaround hack i believe that it s possible to augment links with some prefetch preload metadata in some way so it might be worth someone investigating whether auth login logout links can be modified when presented so give hint to browser anyway thanks michael

so this is my first time trying out the windows 81 universal template in vs 2013 there are two app projects one for desktop and one for phone and a shared code project which apparently gets added to each of the other two projects at compile time i noticed the project manager console allows me to target each project when running the install package comment when targeting the desktop project the default i get the error above when targeting the phone project i get the same error but the target framework indicated is windows phone app windowsphoneapp version 81 i can t target the shared project when i look at the properties page for each app project i don t see a listing for a net target on the application tab as i was expecting but instead they just show an os target the desktop app project says target is windows 81 and the phone app project says target is windows phone 81 no way to change either of them 
hi no it is not only related to http error httperror i would like to be able to make the decision of which type of object is to be deserialized based on the http status code httpstatuscode i ve seen these requests in some google groups or stackoverflow questions but appearantly no one posted it here yet looking at the code i thought making the deserialize method public would be the simplest solution to achieve what i want but of course i could be wrong

still not working i need class 1 class1 serialized into the request body as i can see in add json biody addjsonbiody method in proper way so i create custom serializer and adjust custom serializer to rest request restrequest json serializer jsonserializer but when i call add json body addjsonbody obj serialize mthod of custom serializer is not called how ever the summary from rest request restrequest cs concerning rest request restrequest json srializer jsonsrializer sounds like this method must be called correct me if i wrong here is the summary  summary  serializer to use when writing json request bodies used if request format requestformat is json  by default the included json serializer jsonserializer is used currently using json net default serialization  summary public i serializer iserializer json serializer jsonserializer get set 
maybe there s a misunderstanding i feel like what i m asking is a very common use case the documentation always maps classes 100 to the rest api for example in the serialization page 
now its working but only after i added return response content replace ufeff  remove boom from response i want to know why that boom is injected to the response its not coming from the endpoint 100
sorry i didnt put it that way yes that s what i meant
alexeyzimarev that seems to work 
hi not really because  on before request onbeforerequest and on before deserialization onbeforedeserialization are on rest request restrequest but should be on rest client restclient code must be execute for all query in my case i can handle the case when the csrf are not present  on before deserialization onbeforedeserialization is too soon it will be easy to extract csrf token right after the deserialization csrf token is part of json reponse body maybe a middleware management functionality can be added to rest sharp restsharp there is an example of that feature in guzzle php library http docs guzzlephp org en stable handlers and middleware html middleware which are also a rest client api 
that sounds correct don t forget to add the mass of one water back at the end when calculating the sum thanks

that does seem to get rid of the error i ll write some tests to confirm but it looks positive thanks for your insight ryan closing the ticket 
ryan thanks for the reply that s very helpful i think it s very close to solving my problem the challenge is i won t have access to current project on every request it s possible to be logged in and not be looking at a project but then navigate to a project where i need the permissions so perhaps i need logic so that if a current project is defined it checks the permissions before you can take action in the project and if no project is defined it checks actions based on the controllers that are not associated to a project meaning you aren t acting inside a project like when trying to add a new project which can t happen while in a project should the current project be defined in the application controller for can can cancan thanks 
thanks for the quick response ryan in this case the user should not be able to access this page here is some more complete code http pastie org 1240898
the problem is the manager role is defined at the project level not the app level 
thanks for your quick response i have a table filled with gps data each one marked by a lat long timestamp that belongs to a user so i want to pull data back data based on user but i never want to pull back all the records that would be too much generally all data returned should have their timestamp fall between a start date and end date
unfortunately the includes method is not available in rails 2 but you can still do a products find all include category same goes for conditions select etc the way i liked the most for solving this was to go with a before filter as you suggested in https github com ryanb cancan issues issue 126 issue comment 126comment 367391 and to make it available for all actions  that way i can write that once only and not deal with action names anyway i would prefer the options but if these cannot be supported in the same way in rails 2 and 3 i understand how that is not possible other than how the code looks i don t still see another reason for this request so i close this for now and i ll get back after i examine all the other places i have to apply this if i find anything and sorry for not finding the other issues before i posted this 
i had no clue that this was already in can can cancan must have overlooked it thank you so much ryan 
great thanks 
i will try on task controller taskcontroller index view i only want to display current user tasks if the user is a moderator he she will see all tasks since the permission for moderators is can read task i have to give this permission moderators since on task moderator controller taskmoderatorcontroller index moderators should be able to view all tasks or shorter 
no i didn t authorize explicitly actually it is very simple controller with basic crud i was just testing with cancan note if i add can or cannot method in the view then it is restricting the report and got exception 
andhapp if i get some time i d love to give it a shot btw the rails bug has been closed as the behavior is unintended and the query can be written without the nesting i e the active record activerecord query that the can can cancan ability above ultimately resolves to is  you can rephrase the can can cancan ability using a scope on a and a block i didn t come up with but didn t try very hard an equivalent ability using hash notation that works in rails is 326is there one

yeah that s how i expected it to work 
i thought about running a similar command and did so today it brought chocolate doom to an unplayable crawl weirdly enough the bug didn t happen i ll admit i didn t test all that much but something is up and i m not sure what it is the pi firmware updates every day or so so i m hoping it ll clear up some day 
i decided to try bit 32bit and full screen i just re downloaded the zip to try again 1 unzip to a folder called c chocolate doom new 2 copy over said same as above files 3 launched chocolate doom setup keeping stuff default includes the display at 32 bit full screen x 480 640x480 4 set multiplayer name usually friend and i use this for multiplayer too as it allows for private games 5 setup crashes 6 setup starts itself again then tried it again 1 did steps 13 and skipped 4 same as above 2 use warp feature 3 upon starting game crashes and restarts setup then decided to just make a shortcut to chocolate doom with the command line iwad doom wad that worked but it still takes longer to start up than 200 hope this helps getting the setup program sorted out i tend to use it more than chocolate doom s own exe to select game and like i said friend and i use it for multiplayer too 
yep those are the packs i am using i re downloaded them as well to ensure i had the latest versions all tracks do not loop properly here are 2 examples doom e m 1 e1m1 d e m flac e1m1flac doom e m 6 e1m6 d e m flac e1m6flac

i used thermo library from rmg website primary thermolibrary primarythermolibrary gri mech grimech 30 and burke h o 2 burkeh2o2 the mechanism has 67 species and 1033 reactions 
yes however i think the to single bonds method is primarily used to check isomorphism with a qc calc where it is difficult to determine formal charges on the atoms that s why i decided to add 0 to allowable atomtype charges instead of conserve atom charges with to single bonds method we could keep the charges with to single bonds and add an option to neglect charge with is isomorphic method when comparing with molecule initiated with from xyz 
thanks mark for noting that so initially when i made the input file there were a number of species which were tagged as duplicates however upon subsequent corrections tagged as duplicate species errors the input file passed and model generation begun nonetheless i m tempted to say that you re right since the thermolibrary already has this specie i think removing it from the actual input file might actually make it work let me try that and see what happens thanks for the feedback

yes with setq it works as expected so i also added this line as the first expr in company frontends set in order to see if and when company frontends set might be executed see and behold the output is indeed it is strange that it is executed twice in the beginning but even more strange that it is executed when initializing solarized theme but the most strange thing is that it alters company frontends the third time it is executed

sorry was just about to edit comment turns out i had an old load path for the previous version of company mode sorry for the trouble and cheers for the good work
hmm thanks that sort of works i get this error which is interesting do you think this is the right way to deal with this or should the yasnippet just do the right thing for prefix it still feels like yasnippet should be able to quite easily behave the right way for prefix and return nil when there are no possible completions for the current prefix 
because that s inconsistent neither company dabbrev just tested nor insert exhibit this behavior 
yes it works as expected now wonder why this important variable is not mentioned in the documentation actually i m working on how to configure the best grouped company backends for different major modes although having been using company mode for over one year already got a configuration long time ago but recently realized it was not working as i expected and started looking for the official documentation on how to configure it but found nothing useful for example in emacs lisp mode words in buffers yasnippet elisp company capf etc sorted in this order in the droplist in c c mode words in buffers yasnippet the name variable function struct etc etc in org mode words in buffers yasnippet etc in latex mode words in buffers yasnippet latex environment etc if i insert and it should use company files as the primary backend in above examples there will be a default company backends for all the major modes when company mode is enabled there will be an extra configuration for a specific minor mode  but i cannot make the company elisp work there always are such problems for other major modes the two backends won t work well for a specific major mode no official documentation or examples

nope you get a user error no items suitable for an index found in this buffer in your minibuffer echo messages though

after reproducing it for about 15 times and restarting emacs for 3 times to find the cause i can t reproduce it now 
the major mode is go mode the result of
o k i will contact the author of the backend 
yes which i would assume means that this is actually an issue with emacs itself or at least inferior python mode 
with company ycmd as the only backend it makes no differences 
the command m x company diag reports both y and n variables are of the same type for both completion works in ipython buffer but in emacs elpy buffer it only works for y with company jedi mode none of them gets completion 
i ll do that thanks 
indeed it is very puzzling unfortunately i have not figured out how to reliably produce a problem buffer from a fresh emacs but once there is one it seems to be there to stay i disabled all minor modes reset to fundamental mode called ad restore normality and set the mode line format to nil but the benchmark continued to report 34 seconds then i tried which killed my emacs next time i find a problem buffer i will see if i can make more progress on figuring out what s going on 
exactly the same thing happens i guess you know what the problem is then 
i do not have enough knowledge of the workings of how the menu is displayed note however that the same question can be asked by a developer of emacs if you think that the minibuffer is responsible then how do you explain that it has the correct size in the end 
i just tried with an extemely stripped down emacs and was not able to reproduce it when i get a chance i will try to comment everything out and re enable bit by bit until i find the culprit 
ps the second part has nothing to do with semantic btw it was company gtags that was the culprit i removed it from the backends list and the problem went away so the problem is solved for me but if company gtags is actively maintained that s certainly something for them to look into 
yes i tried to enable yas minor mode but it did not work all the yasnippets in ess python elpy or auctex is not work 
no they don t seem to have words from all buffers complete when they write languages that they don t support they don t have any completions so my question is why 3 is default whether language that company mode support is good the default value is always 3 i want to know reason for this and the consequences that i may have if i decrease this default value thank you 
maybe i m not being clear this is the initial state  which is hardly what i and anybody else i guess want also notice there is no menu involved at all so really no selection at all from the user perspective 
i haven t heard about that function before but i did some investigation and found out that it is quite limited it includes if while until and for and commands in exec path  the reason i thought about it is that i have seen many people adding these keywords to a list and i also had such a list and figured it would be nice out of the box experience i understand if you would like to skip it as the gain is not that big feel free to close if that is the case 
this is what i see image https user images githubusercontent com f e ab e be af efcc 1297289250512821f22e75000ab511e98be0510af906efcc png ideally the retry completion should come after return completion it was working fine before recent releases company diag 
dgutov it s because company mode always show completion at point for example i type var then it shows the full meaning or suggestion variable i don t want that suggestion i want only var so i press enter tab space or almost anything company mode still complete that word for me while i don t want i think escape might be able to solve but doing so is not a solution because it s already bind to evil mode and it s so annoying if i have to do this all the time 
the command line you have does not work since the l argument is a directory does this prevent loading my configuration i think you also need my config settings but i might be able to provide you with a more detailed stacktrace

this would be nice to have for user feedback if a user queues a high priority task that you obviously want to handle asynchronously you can instantly provide the user with job progress i was thinking of something like 
the immediate fix is to vendor the library but i think the correct fix is to change the gem dependency from json to json pure if json is found that lib will be used automatically anyway so the only risk is someone that installs resque but doesn t use json or json jruby anywhere else ends up with slower json processing otherwise there s no way to activate the gem in j ruby jruby 
i ve seen redis server 102 crashing in case of async disk write operation a couple of times strangely enough after each write redis server dropped all active client connections now i m using redis 121 and haven t faced this issue my point in this post was we can have something similar to apache active mq activemq clients which won t exit even if the messaging server is unreachable from client s  i e active mq activemq has crashed for some reason or in case of temporary network disconnection for extended time periods if we can have that kind of feature resque workers will be much more robust 
are you ok with unix timestamps 
it certainly might for my particular scenario i admittedly only looked at it briefly but it seemed like resque web only accepts a single namespace so i d have to run a separate resque web for each environment right now i have a single resque domain com monitoring staging production and shared workers a single instance of my apn sender http github com kdonovan apn sender library can send iphone notifications for both staging and production also it s my impression that you only set the resque redis namespace once per application so this wouldn t work if you wanted to run some of an application s queues in one worker but not all of them e g separating out mailer twitter communication related queues from core system tasks

turns out this was because the vpc i was in was missing a default ipv 6 ipv6 default route adding that fixed the issue for those who find this issue and think they have this same problem make sure an existing ipv 6 ipv6 default routes exists your server might have ipv 6 ipv6 enabled and dns could answer with an ipv 6 ipv6 address but if the network route doesn t exist it ll do you no good

thanks for the quick answer there are some things in geocoder that my directions code would be needing anyway like passing the api key google premier keys caching or handling errors in a unified way cause they re pretty much the same errors like for all other google lookups putting this in a separate gem would mean doing these things twice and possibly in a different way forking would make updates difficult so i ll probably stick to my monkey patch extension thingy monkey opening up geocoder lookup street services actually helps with that and apart from that i was keen to share my code btw directions comes with a pretty cool feature if you pass coordinates the response will contain reverse geocoded addresses and if you pass address strings the response will contain their coordinates so if you need both geocoding reverse geocoding and directions you can skip using the geocoding api and take the results from your directions call

that s true but it would be good to also support people who want to use nominatim or the other ap is apis we don t google to be the only provider what i envisaged as a minimum is to support the codes in searches if your search is a plus code decode it and return it s lat lng basically treat it as you would treat any other reverse geocode of an address  results first plus code global code and results first plus code compound code should probably be reserved for the plus code of the address not the lat lng anyway results might be empty but then how would we return the plus code for the lat lng google and mapbox both use a field outside of the results list for this kind of thing but i don t know if that s an option for you without a ton of refactoring 
yes i am sharing a snippet migration file of address rb which i use to store the geo specific data 
that worked thanks alexreisner edit is there a way to add the fields parameter which allows me to get extra details like the opening hours and such

sorry don t know what you mean please point me to some manual or redmine backlog action 
yes we added one task 
labels yaml had data did as you suggested copied over the stuff in labels yaml default to labels yaml the dropdown box in the plugin configuration now has entries thanks 
it possibly a cross plugin issue i have a lot of plugins installed which work quite well as long as i don t have the backlogs plugin installed too i can see and configure the backlogs plugin in admin settings after sucessful dtabase migration but when i click on any project settings i get the error action view actionview template error stack level too deep plugins redmine backlogs lib backlogs projects helper patch rb 20 i also noticed that when sometimes the error also occurs in any other projetc helper patch rb of any other plugin

i ve done a git pull then a git checkout master so i think i ve the last changeset of master i don t know git but i think it s okay to have the latest master the bug is still there it happens in save directives savedirectives task js line 45 if i log the variable j line 43 in chrome when a click on ok after creating a new task it displays 
error was generated when attempting to access the burn down chart from the master backlog page what steps should i take to verify that patches have been applied 
i just updated to master but get the same problem i just noticed a few more details if all of my sprints have a start date in the future i can successfully view issues otherwise i get this error  the only way to get to the issues view at this point is to switch to a different project then switch back to my original project
yes of course i use thin server i run service thin stop check that thin process disappears from processlist then do all updates and finally run service thin start 
yes remaining time change visible in the issue journal we use redmine stable 142stable 9700 and redminebacklogs v 097 v097
only backlogs but it works on production environment failed on development 
tricky question the literature suggests that bugs in closed sprints should be considered as part of the backlog and treated just like a story feature but this isn t straightforward to implement in a system since most teams will have a tracker such as bug potentially with custom fields for bugs and if you include that tracker as a story then you end up getting the current sprint s bugs also show up as stories on the taskboard cluttering things up and more importantly not showing the relationship between a bug in the current sprint and the associated story in the current sprint one way to solve this is to look at the associations if a bug is a child of a story or child of a task of a story in the current sprint show it as a sub item of the story in that story s row on the taskboard essentially just like a task but visually different bugs from closed sprints would show up as stories this also allows for having a task bug associated with this bug story in the current sprint doing this in backlogs multiple ways i can think of but cleanest might be to have a new tracker selection explicitly for bugs which would behave as outlined above implementing this will i think require fixing the issue reported in 547 so that any child item of a story does not get set to task automatically having a tracker selection just for bugs may not be general enough though as the last poster in 547 mentions the need for various types of trackers as sub items of a task but maybe bugs is a concept that s universal enough that most teams will find this approach useful 
patrickatamaniuk we will try to test it during the day thanks a lot we do not use the velocity based estimate that much usually we use remaining time and estimate more the story points we do not use that well either i would love to use it though we use estimated time and remaining time more regarding the loading of backlogs page i cannot really say since that was not our major concern but for sure i think it is loading faster than before but not much as i see it at least not in our set up i will let you know once we have tested the latest master 
my fault was just a matter of rtfm it is running smoothly now on rm stable 222stable cheers markus
sorry for the late reply we had a public holiday here in italy i confirm that with the latest master 100 the problem is resolved

here s a virtual host virtualhost section copied from the file in etc apache sites apache2sites enabled this is a debian 8 server which recently received a dist upgrade from debian 7 which it had been running for some time apache is pretty much working now current issues probably will be cleared up when all the other conf files virtualhost are cleaned up 1 although systemd complains that apache 2 apache2 isn t starting within 30 seconds apache 2 apache2 clearly starts up 2 also systemd thinks it stops apache 2 apache2 almost immediately yet it doesn t so you have to run the kill command to get apache 2 apache2 working 1 removed a line referring to a php handler can t remember exactly which line but it s the classic one which prevents apache 2 apache2 from changing user so that it can run scripts as the owner of the directory 2 went into webmin servers apache modules and disable php 5 php5 cgi and cgid other issues 1 running multiple versions of php on the server virtualmin does well as it detects them in opt rh however when recently the additional php versions were updated 70 was added 55 was added and 56 was removed because the debian 8 operating system now supplies 56 natively this causes the links to change add new links and remove old links the mydomain com conf file fails to get updated by virtualmin the lines of interest are add handler addhandler fcgi wrapper fcgiwrapper add type addtype and remove handler removehandler for example recently 70 was added and 56 was removed these lines are all interconnected and webmin virtualmin should either update them or should notify the admin to do so because some severe consequences can occur in unexplained hanging behavior of apache 2 apache2 with no errors in logs to alert you 1 it d be nice to add some automatic support for web acceleration technology such as google mod pagespeed apache module plus running apache behind a high speed caching http reverse proxy such as varnish 50 and a high speed https reverse proxy such as nginx to make this work you should add the directive mod pagespeed respect x forwarded proto modpagespeedrespectxforwardedproto on to all of the proxied virtual hosts

jcameron gnadelwartz thank you as stated i had eventually figured out that webmin was adding the this is ok decision i suppose given that webmin is supposed to make our lives easier however it becomes arguably problematic when there is no feedback provided in the webmin interface that this sort of code editing is happening silently behind the scenes would it be possible to provide visual feedback for example a preview of the code as it will be executed by the server alternatively some kid of note help link whatever next to the command line in the webmin edit cron job page thanks for your consideration and all your work on this great product 
it s the backup configuration files module i used it both for backup and restore i selected all modules for backup i really can t name them specifically because there is a lot of them but what s important is that i didn t install any extra or custom modules those were only the default ones now when i look in the module s options for backup there is this and i checked them like shown above totally wild guess but maybe the server configuration files option breaks things when the new server is on a different os by the way the exact os is ubuntu 16044 anyway i saved the configuration backup file which broke my webmin installation and i just sent you an email with that file attached if you wish to try it on ubuntu and have the time to do so but of course be careful only try it in a test environment

yes the issue is that both tomcat and the application are providing their own jar files i was able to resolve the issue like this  just setting the scope to provided is not enough to prevent maven from bringing in the dependency apparently for me this is only a partial solution though because sometimes i run applications as standalone http servers and sometimes as servlets via tomcat and this support library is shared in both cases regardless this was a good suggestion to try and actually fixed the immediate issue my model for how servlet computation works was that there will be no pg connection pgconnection defined in the application at all unless the application actually brings its own but turns out that the libraries loaded from tomcat s lib directory are already available to applications somehow applications may choose to override those classes with their own versions and it even works this sounds more than a little weird to me but maybe it just shadows the globally loaded classes with versions from the app that have the same names via some classloader trickery perhaps it works by delegating to the tomcat s class loader for those classes that can t be found in the app and that is why pg connection pgconnection can be resolved to either app s class or the tomcat s class one consequence of this is that i will now require standalone applications to have a direct dependency to the pg driver but that is actually not a problem it may even be a slight advantage in that this allows me to match the pg client and server versions better

hello sni thank you very much for taking an interest in my problem no it does not work on any service i have nowhere the drop down menu when i have several graphs when i connect to pnp nagios pnp4nagios i see that the service produces two graphs 
simple answer it is there it is my instance i want it  more elaborate it will allow injecting dependencies into the test cases hollywood principle instead of having them grab everything they need which will allow for more elegant implementations i really wanted that when i implemented bumblebee i used singletons and static initializers instead but they don t always do what you want them to and yes it does add a lot of flexibility and opportunity for good things and bad any intelligent fool can probably change the execution in a myriad of ways anyhow for instance by loading an entire spring config before running the tests omitting the object reference will not prevent such things  and you will of course do a good job of informing about the junit properties file so that everyone will have heard about it

the error message is which is correct and gives you a hint what the problem might be but when you don t read the error message carefully you might wonder why the test isn t green i think the problem is that the hamcrest matcher s error message isn t that expressive because it should state explicitly that the matcher type doesn t match the type of the object it is asked to match but on the other hand you could argue that with the stricter signature of expected exception expectedexception expect the compiler would spot that mismatch of types maybe a matcher wrapper for expected exception expectedexception expect or something else ensuring the right type could make it easier to spot such wrong usage of the api while sticking to the current signature nevertheless i still think that a stricter signature for expected exception expectedexception expect should be considered only matcher extends throwable s make sense for expected exception expectedexception expect because you can t match an exception with e g a matcher string

thanks for taking the time to respond  yes we have hide passed tests enabled by default in the ember project we have thousands of tests and i m doing some major refactoring now so it s not uncommon for a few hundred tests to fail when i first break something typically i wait until all the tests are done collapse them all and quickly read through all the titles to figure out what the simplest tests are in ember there is no well defined notion of a simple test and there are surely several alternative solutions than the one i proposed  uniformly tag our basic tests across all modules with basic or unit so we can easily apply filter basic  run the tests only for the relevant modules at a time  this is prohibitive because 1 we have hundreds of modules and i don t think there s a way to group them into super modules and 2 it s not always easy to predict how far reaching your change will be for these reasons i prefer to just run all the tests and scan the titles to figure out what to fix next  display modules in an accordian style http jqueryui com accordion ui that can be collapsed  autocollapse the tests after a certain height number of failures this could be configurable like hide passed tests  just suck it up it s not a huge deal after all p
as far as my limited understanding of how the library works it modifies my javascript to insert a line of code in between every line of my code to figure out what lines were run by my tests and which lines were not run by my tests and i just tried using q unit qunit begin and it did not work 
glad it seems please you you can play with the online demo http demo angelozerr rhcloud com code mirror codemirror java qunit html which uses the qunit tern plugin with web browser code mirror codemirror done with https github com angelozerr qunitjs com commit a c e ca c cf a 346871 10a329951c331192568e5ca59c9468cf2a346871
trentmwillis the difference is variable scope and grouping it s like a comment in reddit which could be subcomment and subsubcomment that s the main point to split it in difference module then it cannot reuse variable i got from the previous test get user i ds userids properly is also a test that i do assert another use case is to test many items that could be test each one asynchronously ability to asynchronous test each block will be neat i test 3 user separately and want to display result of test in its own block but when i do async it was race against each other and report flat result indently group is better 
will do 
upgrading q unit qunit fixes the issue thanks for the prompt response 
i guess this comparison shows the changes that were done for the old fork of qunit https github com qunitjs qunit compare master simula innovation gas 
this happens when fetching cloning and quick cloning when i tested the quick clone i noticed there were fewer number of untracked directories in this case i suspect the casing was fixed during some earlier tfs checkin 
hello sorry i could not respond sooner the output to that command is like the below  to give a little more context on what my attempt was i d like to use git tfs in an attempt to push pull changes to from different tfs repos is this possible taking the concept of forking i d like to fork a tfs project make changes to the fork maintain a special branch in the fork for changes that i want to push back to the original repository and then push all the other changes up into the forks tfs repo as well do you think this is possible

woops brain finger disconnect wrote quick clone will raise another issue for that one meant pull title fixed this was a freshly cloned repo then there was a single non conflicting change via a checkin using tfs normally i use git tfs fetch and then git rebase tfs default usually when i rebase i would see a list of conflicts to address command exited with error code 1 is meaningless to me in this context it doesn t tell me what failed and what i need to do to make it not failed i m not sure whether the fetch succeeded and the rebase failed or if the fetch did not complete successfully even changing the error message to git rebase exited with error code 1 would be a better message here unfortunately i don t like my chances to repro as the repo has moved on since then if i do have an issue next time i ll see what i can do with d 
663 fixed the problem thanks
will do
spraints apoligies for the delay this is a work project and i only saw your reply at beer o clock on friday gist here https gist github com fluffynuts fed a ad d a 6 37fed8026a578ad9d3a6 to me it looks like i am still attached to tfs default but i could well be missing something if i had diverged surely checkin should fail in addition to rcheckin or is that just another piece of the puzzle that i m missing 
unfortunately not i just went with the method that got me the files i need but no history and then just moved on not that it matters too much but i had colleagues on other teams interested in moving their tfs repositories to git and using this as the way there in the interim which is exactly what my team did in the past but had to recommend against it 
this works i ignored this because i thought cake is an additional tool that must be previously installed 
hi pmiossec sure i put with double quotes but still got error if we change the branch name in tfs it will not retain history after migration to git can you please suggest how to solve this issue thanks my scenario  msys no pathconv 1 git tfs clone https evrt tfspro houston entsvcs net tfs tfs 01 tfs01 ito amer us adu sda asset analysis assetanalysis financial reconciliation initialized empty git repository in c users zhopengf financial reconciliation git error the path ito amer us adu sda asset analysis assetanalysis financial reconciliation you want to clone doesn t exist you may be able to resolve this problem

hi orefalo please have a look at the screenshot attachment and the attached example demo validators demovalidators html what i would love to see is that when you hit submit all the error popups will be appeared in both tabs without overlapping with one another wilkins on tue apr 19 2011 at 1156 am orefalo reply reply github com wrote 
feature request i would like a flag show arrow showarrow in the options object passed to actions this would do the same thing that the similarly named flag in show prompt showprompt does it would be nice if changing away from the default prompt position didn t cause the arrow that is pointing towards an erroneous field entry to go away e g when you specify no prompt position promptposition you get the prompt above the field with an arrow pointing at the field however once you change the position to let say center right centerright you lose the arrow pointing towards the field arrow j query jquery admin form adminform validation engine validationengine init no arrow j query jquery admin form adminform validation engine validationengine init prompt position promptposition center right centerright scroll false apologies if i have missed the option that allows this i see it for show prompt showprompt but none of the action options 
the original field s hook just doesn t work see http stackoverflow com questions jquery 5838131jquery plugin validationengines hook not executing
if i remove validation engine validationengine then i can close the dialog box freely but if it is there then i can not do that
sorry i should have said i already tried the latest master and it fails there as well 
i m using 200113257 m how can i upload the exact code to test i will make a try to include test code i have omitted opening  this code doesn t validate with chrome code form style display inline id form 1 form1 name form 1 form1 class formular method post table border 0 width 90 tr td width 200 field td td input class validate required name qfield id qfield value size 87 maxlength 200 td tr table form code 
yeah i have 3 or 4 different functions called by input type text and by a select i have no issues with those only with the file type input but i just got an error if i took the same function on a text input probably my function is corrupt somehow heres my function 
no one but 016977 is the only uk area using 54 format so it s often used as an example interesting co incidence if 016977 in some other country was intended  if i had to guess which countries these were supposed to be 494312 777 777 germany 1 305 6130958 x 101 x101 us canada 305 613 09 58 ext 101 us canada 3056130958 us canada 33 1 47 37 62 24 extension 3 france 016977 1234 uk almost where else could it be 04312 777 777 germany 911234512345 india 58 295416 7216 venezuela
no i cannot change the position the statement has no effect i am loading the form into an existing div using ajax
i user ajax validation on a file type input but when i validate this file on back end which is a php file it didn t receive the whole file but a fake file for example there is a picture which i was validating it but at back end this field value fieldvalue is field value fieldvalue  string c fakepath jpg 1jpg length 17 it suppose to be a file like files tmp name  xxx tmp files name  xxx jpg files size  787878 
i thought that lubridate had to account for all the leap time within its code how will it know that the missing second is invalid if it isn t coded in i m not sure when the missing second will be but if i find out i will test it to find how lubridate handles it 
i believe the principle should be the same in hms we need roll minutes and seconds and normalise hours accordingly and in periods such as you describe it is days and months years need normalising however i currently do not have a solutions to it do you agree to this 
warning is gone with current master on git hub github excellent thank you vspinu thanks also for the compliment about radiant comments and suggestions welcome 
hi thank you for your suggestion with this i found that there was a problem with r studio rstudio instead of lubridate i fixed it with the following command system defaults write org r project r force lang fr ca utf 8
i submited the patch to code igniter codeigniter repo
at the moment i ve created a folder called v 1 v1 inside the api folder copied the example controller the that folder and added this line to the routes route v any v1any  v 11 v11 shouldn t it be as straight forward as that 
sorry for the late response removing the json argument from the rest post function solved the problem this is how it suppose to work correct thought it is included in phil s tutorials this rest post employer post new project postnewproject param json 
meant set initial value of allow to false if i don t do that it will never get into the auth override block since i m not using api keys 
oh i see i need to define a route like this route api usuarios any  api usuarios index get 1 to make it work right sorry i thought the library was doing it on background thanks 
sorry was mistaken 
hi chris thank you so much for your quick reply that was the issue although i have php 54 i runned phpinfo and saw that the server was using 52 now is working perfectly
thank you for your response i miss read the documentatin and indeed the solution is http example com pets id 1
the problem is that result is used to authenticate and saved to database in that format and when yo try to use it key don t match key in that format can t be used 
yes i did on jun 9 2016 311 pm chris kacerguis notifications github com wrote

hi chriskacerguis sure if you install siege brew install siege then run on your api siege c 100 c100 d 10 d10 t m t5m http example com test endpoint thanks
it is now working for me when i create a new project i m really not sure where the glitch is happening but until i have more details we can consider this not a glitch in sinatra thank you for your help 
try this  sinatra fails to parse the request properly i m not sure of the http specification on this matter i tunes itunes is probably off spec here but i thought this problem might be a symptom of incorrect assumptions in sinatra s request parser 
no since it s doesn t know absolute time when it wraps a fixnum it only responds to its methods on saturday april 2 2011 at 225 am cactus wrote 
just tested and webrick sets the date header too so webrick sets it unicorn sets it you said passenger sets it i would have to agree at this point that it doesn t make sense for sinatra to set it i added a very simple rack middleware that sets the date for testing and it resulted in about a req 20req s on my machine performance hit not sure if it was from the call invocation overhead or the time object instantiation i think it makes more sense to roll the date call into the webserver since it should be added on page returns regardless i haven t opened a thin issue yet but i am going to closing this issue because after thinking about it i agree that it probably shouldn t be sinatra s job to worry about this particular header thanks for the feedback 
yeah i found the issue if doesn t have dir public in your app it will fail to 404 all request that s weird to me 
my nginx config now has  thanks for directing me to the changlog entry will look into this given this info i see it is not a bug with sinatra morgan
ruby config ru my config ru looks like this 
rkh not sure and by running it through the ruby command line tool 
thanks

trying to put something together however after further investigation this also happens on this server with a rails app deployed via passenger so it s not really a sinatra issue maybe a rack or passenger issue i ll try and create a sample app but if you want to close this i understand

noahc i don t want to use before filters because then i will have to explicitly report on every type of route i have i want to use middleware so that every route i have will be automatically reported without any changes to the application code itself 
git version 2130 on mac os macos sierra just tried again still the same issue 
some steps to reproduce the issue were missing fair enough 1 generate post request body 
closing the issues it was my problem i added the following code in my init script  that s why it s being happening 
thanks that helped i ve opened https github com rack rack issues 1386
damn that was fast d
the created can default to time now but i think the expires should be customizable defaulting to 1 minute seems to be the default of various soap tool like soap ui soapui thanks josh
right now i m doing it as username password in the header so i really just want to be able to set the soap header at the client level ps just want to say that it s awesome to have found this library thanks 
gemfile seems to be locked at c e c ba ed d a af c a b 6c713e585c24ba0ed2d58a2571489af12c1a309b i am not entirely sure that was the exact revision at the time of testing but i did start with the latest release gem at the time i now have it working with manually specified endpoint and namespace but as i had other weirdness along the way i am not 100 certain that they are required for the thing to work 
sure i would like to see which attributes the operation requests can have something like response client operation operation attributes response full  name string required price decimal response fields  name price so it would be a kind of extension for the client operations i hope you get the picture 
here s a gist of running the tests on savon https gist github com 4402763 it happens because response hash will sometimes not return a hash you can see it in the tests 
i ll email you the wsdl i was given its for a closed hotel pms system i m not sure if it correctly indicates the need for the xml attributes i mentioned but its all i was able to get from my customer and we were successfully integrated with their api using savon 12 and this wsdl thanks on thu jan 10 2013 at 525 am daniel harrington notifications github com
yes i am using the rails logger for both so you mean that i can make a new instance of rails logger set it s log level to debug and have savon use that logger instead and both instances will log to the same environment log file 
i get the same problem when i try to debug to file the error is raised when i call response body therefore i used response inspect and the extracted the body variable 3 mb of data  edit it is strange to see the greater than symbol after quote one body the raw body variable doesn t have this problem

sure this is obviously non sensical but it reproduces the error  few things to note the session i d id will expire at some point let me know if this is an issue i can call other ws without a problem actually the session id got generated from an authenticate ws in the same wsdl i played with the case of execute sql query e g i tried execute s ql sql query but none of those work i get the expected error from the client not server that this is a none existing operation thanks mark
sorry just got back to a place where i have computer access i m not too familiar with righting rspec tests is there a similar test you could recommend that i can try modifying

i will add failure code on my github account and will let you know 
yes i meant validate templates and the files exist in the file system 
oh so sorry i had the repo set as a private one in error oops i changed it to public now but to answer your question notebook arguments ip 0000 port 8888 notebook dir veva 
trbs tnx for the reply how the only way that comes to my mind in order to let you reproduce it is to have the same db schema that i have hence you ll need a db dump schema only i forgot to mention since i thought wasn t important for this i m using postgresql 968 as db backend is that what you want 
if i don t use non ascii character on package sources r cmd check can be passed but in my case i need to specify encoding because i use non ascii character like korean on sources i think encoding on description is not mandatory rule 
in my opinion 1 all five missing values na na real etc should pass 2 values that don t have length one should fail you could document or have an example to say that vector return values should be combined with any or all or use the more general expect equal the alternate behaviour is to work like if and throw a warning i don t think that this is right though it s easier to work with if tests simply pass or fail rather than throw warnings 3 recursive return values like list na and data frame na should fail 4 the string na should fail you might need to be careful about coercing to logical 5 attributes are ok for example c na na and structure na class whatever and matrix na should pass be careful about testing with identical expect true expect false and expect na form a triumvirate so you need to make sure that the behaviour is consistent across all three functions 
thanks hadley thats a good idea i will have a think how that may work with my particular package 
krlmlr no it just shows the context
so am i thanks for the fix 
redhead are you fixing it 
i know but nette may improve the lack of this 
done not closing this issue untill bower has updated new git endpoint it has to be done manually by them 
i thought that all big files are causing memory exhaustion or just own binary files but i find out it causes files containing null characters x 00 0x00 like file generated from dev zero i tried some big files gb 1gb like video file generated from dev urandom and when i have used function getimagesize  it passed but didn t returned any mime type and was terribly slow when i have used file info fileinfo i have got right mime type instantly without delay and without memory exhaustion

well imagine you are in production someone deletes you valuable data you are happy making backups then your customer informs you about the missing data you look at your backups that were all green and see that the data is missing in all of your remaining backups not that good what do you think 
yep the latest gems from rubygems org i am running it as a different user but have to run gem install as sudo and no i m not using rvm but i still have access to the gems 
ok this project depends on fog 1111 https github com locomotivecms engine it s a ruby cms backup gem depends on 1101 just wanted to integrate backup with locomotive cms locomotivecms sites to have automatic backups is it possible to update fog dependency to latest one 
in my case i updated from version 3 to version 4 for some reason the new version was not called at all i think i removed version 3 and double checked that i was using the 4
tom i m sorry i had to install sudo apt get install build essential 
i wasn t necessarily thinking of file names zip files for example support custom meta they have a description meta of some sort i was wondering if the same could be used for the gzipped files zip gzip perhaps they have the same features 
thanks for the quick response it does have an image but i can t specify dimensions because i need it to be responsive 
i have found the bug only with iron browser ver 25 which is the same of chrome not found the bug in opera 12 and firefox 16 for a test of the bug with iron or chrome you can go to this page that will remain only for a few days http www leonardocorneli it colorbox php i did another change i insert the loaded width loadedwidth 0 just after it s first assign at the line 353 of the version 1426 i have also tested the modified source in some browsers with no problem greetings
no unfortunately this does not work disappointed i have only a svg element
great that works thanks man it was really helpful
i m trying to create a cron job to send a pdf through e mail at the moment the user goes to the page clicks the export to pdf button wicked pdf than convertsthe html page to pdf they save it locally to there hard drive and attach to the e mail i would like to automate this have the ruby script go through the database get what it needs look at a template or view html file create and send the pdf 
sorry for being late on this i will investigate a little further and will provide some more infos 
currently using 094
i m using wicked pdf 094
i use max os x as development environment and ubuntu 1004 as production my wkhtmltopdf s version is 099 from the gem wkhtmltopdf binary i have tried to get the newest version of souce and compiled it by hand and put it in usr local bin and point this into the initializer with this way wicked pdf even could not work to generate a pdf i think it should be the fonts problem of wkhtmltopdf as you said same issue with prawn you should setup the font before generate chinese character i would try your solution later and let you know the result 
i submitted a ticket with wkhtmltopdf as well 
the reason i wanted wicked pdf to wrap the existing pdf is because it s on s 3 s3 but i ve resolved that issue i will bookmark these links should i need them thanks 
i also think wkhtmltopdf is a better key exe path makes me think of some windows executable 1 i ll see what i can do but currently my schedule is crazy maybe just some better instructions for the readme i also find confusing the part about assets pipeline it s not very clear what we have to do to make it works with it 
app assets pdf css scss exists as does public assets pdf css
unixmonkey threading as the culprit might be a good suggestion considering the randomness of the errors the error occurs on heroku when seemingly it s the only process on the dyno locally i use the same procfile and run two workers using heroku local and cannot replicate i ve tried with 10 workers locally and a handful of documents at once no errors i ll try unicorn here s my procfile 
unixmonkey when the new instance is generated that time it will pull the latest code from master branch and run necessary commands like bundle install rake db migrate and etc 
if you have the fix please could you send me the compiled assembly thanks and regards davide

sorry my statement has a problem the upstream file used by the webjars jqgrid https github com webjars jqgrid project is current project the actual version of the jquery jq grid jqgrid min js file in the current project from 453 to 460 is 452 so when jq grid jqgrid is introduced through the webjars jqgrid https github com webjars jqgrid of version 453 to 460 and the jquery jq grid jqgrid min js file is used the version 452 of jquery jq grid jqgrid min js is actually used 
it might make sense ldd looks fine but i do have two ncurses 60 installations in two slots gentoo related concept i ll try to remove one and reinstall everything 
i m also running tumbleweed so there might be some pattern here
jonas thanks that works i like format oneline or even format format sorry i had looked in the manpage but didn t find anything related here s https github com jonas tig pull 843 if you think that s worth a mention in the doc for tigrc if not and you don t want to clutter it i totally understand it just close the pr 
oops perfect thank you sub sent with a href http githawk com git hawk githawk a sub 
well the point is that into multiple choice filter multiplechoicefilter into its filter function the value incoming was just single value the last value in the url it seems that rest framework or django itself takes the url arguments as form and runs it through clean and cleaning only leaves the last value might be issue because of rest framework serialization or something i use model serializer and model viewset on that page i fixed it this way  i m not that skilled in django yet so i don t know if this is the correct way or if the two problems i encoutered are normal and expected i think especially the second problem with inheriting is not expected 
i m using ng resources ngresources angular js angularjs on the client it translates the javascript code api my model mymodel query mysubmodel in 159 into my api myapi mymodel mysubmodel in mysubmodel 1mysubmodel in mysubmodel 5mysubmodel in 9
i sure ca ad m
full slightly anonymized stack trace  i just double checked the tests are run with python manage py test with tox 
well here it was evaluating even when the filter parameter for it was not provided i ll setup a fiddle of sorts but you just have to provide the queryset for it and verify the behavior easely with django debug toolbar 
indeed dev 1 200dev1 does seem to have fixed the issue once i managed to realise that the name parameter is now called field name 
i m not sure whether this was a real issue or whether it is an issue any longer some changes were made and now the issue was marked resolved by another developer on sentry if you re still interested this was for django 226 drf 3103 django filter 220 here s the raw trace from sentry that picked up the issue 
full traceback 
you can spec the queryset but because you can chain querysets it gets annoying to spec the mock that will actually be passed to this filter e g you end up needing to track the exact chain of calls on the queryset prior to the filter queryset method and mock something like mock qs all return value filter return value distinct return value mock spec query set queryset it s not impossible but it is fragile could the assert be changed to a logging error instead or implemented as a type hint 
i wrote this small example to elaborate it may not be 100 correct and will be missing many conditions but will provide an insight here if a user wants custom created at he makes input duration true and adds duration in a get request and created before is modified accordingly 
ru devise invitations user send instructions   email result in flash   email 
what your writing is exactly what i m doing however your last comment got me thinking and i did some testing as it turns out my override method isn t being found and the application is using the original create action just to double check i am overriding by having an invitations controller rb in my app controllers not in a devise sub dir the code inside this controller is exactly this class invitations controller invitationscontroller devise invitations controller invitationscontroller def create super resource roles params resource name roles if resource errors empty end end am i missing something

i ended up just avoiding modifying the actual invitations controller and it s worked out i went with something like this  the rake routes output seemed to be correct and was no longer pointing to the devise controller but i was never able to get it to work i think this is a better solution anyway but i wish i d been able to figure out why it wasn t working the first way thanks for the help though 
it did the trick thx 
yes here is what was in the mailer invitation instructions html haml view  it worked as needed thanks a lot sergio 
oh yes i found a part of code which overrides the deliver invitation method and calls invitation instructions self with just one now i see it accepts token as well i need to take care of that thanks  apologies for the troubles
sorry my mistake i just wrote the wrong example i have updated it now 
it happens with all new users not only this one after i upgrade to 133 there are no other changes just bundle update with new devise and devise invitable if i force it back to 132 it works fine irb main 0040 user find by email asdm ads asd inspect asd1inspect user load ms 10ms select users from users where users email  asdm ads asd 1 asd1 and users deleted at is null limit 1  user id 4158 email asdm ads asd 1 asd1 encrypted password  reset password token nil reset password sent at nil remember created at nil sign in count 0 current sign in at nil last sign in at nil current sign in ip nil last sign in ip nil created at 20140207 222216 updated at 20140207 222217 authentication token nyq koj us z u eas zxszl nyqkojus8zu3easzxszl firstname nil lastname nil team id 1 properties favorite projects invitation token ce fb f b b ca fbce d dcdb d a 71ce9fb869f1b555b5011ca8126fbce5264169d3364dcdb0d6a invitation sent at 20140207 222216 invitation accepted at nil invitation limit nil invited by id 2 invited by type nil super admin false project admin true deleted at nil notify false clock 24 clock24 false avatar nil timezone nil invitation created at 20140207 222216 invitations count 0 when i switched back to 132 it works but invited by type is also nil i had a look directly in the database and all the users invited by type field is empty 
oh i tried that in that case the validation of the password fails then i am skipping the password as follows  avatar is saved but it invalidates the token so when i try to set the password it fails with invitation token is invalid any ideas how i can skip updating the token with update attributes thanks a bunch 
ooops yes it worked for me thank you very match 
apparently others gems have not changed with 132 same result with 136
logged all queries in postgres to logfile as below  the token being queried for matches what is in the database on users table for this particular user invitation still find by invitation token returns nil almost every time which i m checking via an inspect printed to log after the function is called in my invitations controller method resource from invitation token 
i expect devise parameter sanitizer sanitize invite to return but it s returning

wait i am checking it apparently it works now but not my main code let me check again my code and if the problem persist then ill as for your gel knolleary thank you 
unfortunately i m not that good in writing whole libraries for myself i m not an expert in that i m only experienced in looking at examples and rewriting them for my code  i hope someone will pick up the idea and look at those cheap yet powerful energy efficient g hz 24ghz transceivers which are ideal and cheap alternative for zig bee zigbee 
i have installed it from github if installation path is wrong please suggest me how it can be done can we use it for gsm using at commands 
knolleary i updated it through arduino ide first i had 26 but it didnt work so i went through all available versions and then went back up to 22 i even tried the x 1x versions but no luck
hello knolleary thanks for your help cross fade crossfade doesn t matter now all my tests including just one line in loop and it is mqtt loop mqttloop publishing is successful i m not sure about rate and size of publishing messages because i m using hap node js nodejs https github com ady san adysan hap node js nodejs and can t found rate and size defining in its code but i m sure esp got messages because it s blinking everytime i m publishing also publishing can cause reconnection of esp to mqtt here is a video about that i didn t catch moment of rare message receiving because it is really rare but it still happens from time to time video on dropbox https www dropbox com s lctpylsn am dai lctpylsn7am0dai video mp dl mp4dl 0 
ah ok i edited the define in the source file and it now accepts my larger message
hi yes exactly what is happening i am using mqtt over ssl nope it works perfectly fine not big like 30 chars i have also noticed that if the topic is more than like 30 chars it also crashes i does seem that if i make the message smaller i can have a longer topic but i haven t tested this more than once thanks
trying to send data in azure cloud
i am using the default parameters in the mqtt esp ino esp8266ino file so the loop is running every 2 seconds 
in this case i would vote for consistency i really like the way you handle collections and if i had to rewrite my application code anyway i could use e g pre select list to a text 2text pre option text is also a good idea 
i was on 1407970 dev downgraded to 120742100 stable and all is fine i think i will stay on stable chrome now that chrome driver chromedriver works with it thanks 
someone wanted it on stackoverflow they couldn t work out how to use the style method as it returned an empty string see http stackoverflow com questions how 8979993how do i view css styles that apply to an html element in watir webdriver i m more than happy to close it and see if it comes up as a request again 
the element that i needed to check was disabled was a table data cell tabledatacell it may not be a standard thing to be disabled but the product i m developing automated tests for opted to disable the cell instead of the input inside of it i made a patch to the elements class to solve this namely  and this may have solved my problem or it does nothing but makes my test pass but i d hope to have a bit more support for other disabled elements in the future maybe what my product does is not kosher but people many have reasons to disable things other than inputs so i m suggesting that this disabled tag be added to other things as well i suppose

titusfortner for firefox for chrome
that s the odd thing i m actually not referencing it i searched me repo for iframe name and it s nowhere to be found not at my laptop at the moment but the code it s failed on above is something like browser div id preview wait until present other issues i ve had with iframes is that wait until present doesn t wait on the iframe element i ve had to do things like browser iframe id some id someid div wait until exists using present or leaving the div out gives me a timeout exception saying it waited 30 seconds for the element to exist it doesnt wait 30 seconds it instantly checks and fails 
i thought the ie driver version needed to match the ie version just like the chrome driver version i downloaded the new ie driver which solved my problem thank you
241 pep 8 pep8 157 pyflakes 081 mccabe 031 c python cpython 350 on linux 
maybe but not right now i ve rearranged this code so that black no longer tries to put the operator on its own line so it s not currently an issue for me for anyone else running into this issue the reason black put the operator on its own line is that when it reformats code from operators as the last thing on the line to operators as the first thing on the line it gets confused by comments within a multi line expression you can manually move the operator from the line by itself before the comment to the start of the line after the comment and black will be happy with that 
python 367 pycodestyle 231
apperently the version of pyflakes that i had installed did crash it was a bit outdated this caused all the linting in my ide not to happen it just happened that the first code i decided to write with my new pycodestyle install was something that crashed pyflakes 
yes 
thanks for some reason when i only use redcarpet the quotes are still dumb i just switched to kramdown and typogruby together and that seems to be working great 
sure does ruby p 358 187p358 on mountain lion here 
bobthecow should be more readable now thanks for the nudge 
not really that patch constrains you to have the toc flowing togheter with the html for instance i m using the html and html toc to build the page and its toc into different reps the solution presented in 200 is good but it doesn t allow you to perform only the html toc pass alone 
hi denis sorry for the late reply been out of the office for a while there was no bug something was broken in my rvm setup the sass filter is running fine after a fresh install 
dear sir the following below mentioned are the error found after running nanoc version command please guide the solution regards
apologies for not updating the post we have an older site that uses config yaml but it does have an entry for text extensions the extensions listed are your typical text file extensions jpg is not listed there so the issues is not resolved 
hm nope the only line in the app referencing default is rules which specifies the layout like this  i re typed the whole layout default line to verify that there are no invisible characters but i still get the same nanoc identifier invalid prefix error invalidprefixerror error
oh interesting i didn t catch the double bundle that s a good point i tried it both ways and still no luck tho with bundle exec on foreman invocation but not on the procfile commands and vice versa i also tried deleting my whole bundle directory and re bundling in case i had a bad old gem around or something but no difference does error wrong argument type nanoc cli cleaning stream cleaningstream expected file point to anything else we could investigate 
is nanoc compiling all files irrespective of changes and if yes then is there any way to stop it and compile only those file have changed or is there any way to reduce the compilation time in upgraded nanoc version and using command nanoc compile verbose not getting the full description where time taken is there anyway to check detail compilation time taken by each file nanoc compile https cloud githubusercontent com assets c cc 460260016446130c57561cc dee 3dee e b 11e6813b e c da png 3e7762c7da33png 
i still see them from time to time i m running a variant with my patch so they get processed as errors for me it s not reliable i haven t intentionally removed any links that triggered the issue but the rate of occurrence has definitely gone down as i have cleaned up other external link issues i have a lot of external link issues to clean up that makes me wonder whether there s some leakage from one worker to another or whether an exception in one thread can also result in an exception in another i don t know whether those are things that can happen under ruby s threading model 
ok i can definitely reproduce it with 491 and even sometimes with 490 but in that version it is quite rare could it be ruby 25 that messed it up or am i one of the only ones that get to have that 
thank you for the reply to be more clear all people in the contact have same rule and then alerting checks put different alert to some of the contact un evenly say we have problem 110 then some one get 345 some one get 1 and some one get none etc

i hardly expected this level of support  affirmative to your questions and now when i tried running the rewrite query in lnav directly i first swap out the sc status for just sc status no colons and the command works like select sc status   select message from http status codes where status sc status   from iht apache notice i ve had to include my format as a table name  from iht apache all my queries require it why is this but this with or without colons is still not working in the rewrite i only get http status integers for sc status 
thanks it worked is there a way to customize the colouring of level and jmsg and is it possible to hide jmsg and only toggle it using a shortcut

yes all working thanks 
thank you  yes i did try the 2 calls literally as in your example  a symbol defiined in a but not in b gives out a no symbol error i tried several examples maybe a basic one could be lib a liba hiredis lib b libb whatever uses hiredis lib for example in this case i cannot resolve redis connect redisconnect symbol which is defined in libhiredis sorry if i m surely not a hacker just found nodejs extremely fundamental and ffi an important component to leverage on thank you again m

hi too tall nate tootallnate my environment are ubuntu 140 node 40 thanks for your reply my bug has been resolved because i m creating c code in cpp file so i must change it to c file or add this line at begin of the cpp file extern c 
i require ffi and get errors what s wrong 
i wil try it asap and will post feedback thanks 
alright thanks for trying for me it crashed i ve moved on 
i ll see if i can extract an example sans domain
dchelimsky awesome thank you 
thanks guys i ll take a look at the constant scoping as well i m hoping that it shouldn t matter i do rely on the scoping in my code to pick up the correct constant but i don t think it should be a huge problem as i rarely if ever use the same constant name from two different scopes in the same method that seems like it would drive one insane  if i notice anything else i ll let you guys know thanks 
yes thank you so much alindeman 
myronmarston you are right using the anything matchers for the first two arguments allowed the expectation to pass so the question remains why does the output show a diff on the third argument 
so that fails to setup the matchers at all tests passes but they re just no ps nops i thought it might be related to 382 so followed the syntax there and got the same result where the puts here is never evaluated 
yes it does cf https github com freerange mocha the spec was green before migration the spec to rspec 3
i m not sure what s going on either sorry for that i messed something up 
right before the backtrace 
but its definitely a testing issue and testing is done via rspec does it belong into another rspec project like rspec core maybe its an rspec rails problem 
hi jon rowe jonrowe i tried to run https github com purbon playground tree master call origin with module with your proposed options and i see the same error  i did several attempts to reproduce this error with code as the one in https github com rspec rspec mocks commit f bd b b abcd a c 6326 6f1941bd1b0870b17abcd40503706922a31c6326 however i was only able to reproduce this in situations as the one using https github com guyboertje jrjackson the code checking here and messing the stuff up is defined in https github com guyboertje jrjackson blob master src main java com jrjackson jr jackson raw jrjacksonraw java l 27 l27 might be we found also an issue in jruby 
jon rowe jonrowe exactly that could be happening because real method is already undefined renamed at moment respond to missing is called that code is extracted from proxy object that proxy all calls to encapsulated object something like https gist github com t hk d dc c b e e b 2 t3hk0d38dc7420c74b1e05e49b2 problem that calling stubbed object method from method missing cause infinite recursion stack level too deep myronmarston what the point exception here only for indication that method missing being called also i ve tested that spec on 341 and its okay method missing not being called but fail on 344
labels utc labelsutc false working
it s not synchronized also and this may not be related but it goes away if i remove the call to synchronizer i get this error in the console uncaught type error typeerror cannot read property clear of undefined which is complaining that the plotter value is undefined 
for the ui reason there is another use case where the stack charts will have there own date axis and at the bottom we will have just the dy graphs dygraphs range selector but the problem is dygraphs range selector dont draw axis so we have gone with our own implementation of range slider one way would be to provide options that will allow user to specify not to draw the chart just the axis
sorry if my tone was too negative here s a version of noisy data noisydata with k 5k points http pastebin com r knt kv q rkntkv3q loading dygraphs master tests synchronize html in chrome will then take about 30 seconds note that with only k 2k points it takes about 6 seconds so the synchronization is not scaling well without sync on it takes about 4 seconds given the importance for my project i d happily help fix the issue should i begin in synchronizer js 
i am reading it now i see i use the killed options i ll use the new ones and come back keep in mind i made the same test 2 weeks ago and had the same result 
sorry i don t know how to properly report this it breaks at this function 
oh embarrassing if i commented roll period rollperiod out it displays the correct values 
astaninger you can still run the application as sudo or root user 
oh that s quite nice actually i was looking for documentation on github  thanks 
there is no traffic it is a test page script
ok
yes the same message to 2 channels but channel 2 must be provided in the message content 
this is nchan config
yes i know that i can define different locations i m talking about case when on one channel there is need to publish messages with different lifetime each second issue is that i don t wanna define for example 100 locations and need to reconfigure nginx each time when developers make new channel for subscribers so there is w in nginx conf and it would be nice to give an option for app developers to define dynamicly buffer length and timeout for whole channel or even better for any single message when it is published this would be very powerful 
it is running on a bit 64bit system we are using nchan 108 compiled against nginx 1102 the current counters seem to have reset back to normal values after upgrading to 110 i will keep an eye on the status to see if the problem persists
aha that makes the problem go away with two nginx workers if i run it for m 10m across k 5k channels and about k 200k messages i see the problem anywhere between 2080 times with one nginx worker i made the same run several times and the problem did not occur 
nginx 1134 nchan 117
actually nothing in logs thats why i am not able to understand what is actually going wrong but one thing is sure same configuration is working fine for 117 and not for versions above 
sure leo tysm 1 i ll be back in a few hours 
faraday 087 this is the load time before setting up a middleware stack 
ooh yea i like the block configuration interface 
i understand the reasoning for the change i d just like to be able to continue to serialise these objects without needing to alter them on our side as we re using the serialisation for record keeping the more data we can have the better the historical keys in the json object have been method body url request request headers ssl response headers status i can t think of a generic way to address the serialisation problem the addition of a to json as json method would do that for us but it wouldn t cover yaml marshal or any of the other possible serialisation schemes perhaps the best solution is to note that request and env objects are unsuitable for serialising as is it might also be possible to make request have a serialisable method or something similar that returns all sections of the request object that aren t recursive references in a struct or hash structure

yes bash is the default shell what s strange is that executing the cron entry as the same crontab user on the shell command works i am tracking down why bundler was complained about too the previous 053 cron syntax works though this is what s intriguing

i have a bashrc and a profile but not a bash profile both are unmodified stock ubuntu files i changed the cron job to put the full path to the rake binary and that worked so somehow etc environment isn t being sourced from the cron job etc environment sets the path 
no but users ankit has an rvmrc file its contents are 
i was just looking at if from sysadmin perspective since crontab is seen by admin out of schedule rb context it just makes it easier to read and understand what is scheduled to run and how often i do understand though that this is not something you may want to address

davedevelopment more code application 1 the problem is that instead of app command app1command very good command verygoodcommand returning 0 for success when running the mock object returning 0 that is it hits it and verifies it is executed once but it doesn t immediate return the 0 as instructed instead it goes further past that class method and tries to execute the database functionality under the hood there was a problem connecting to the database sqlstate hy 000 hy000 2002 no such file or directory what s a good way to mock this a mock that actually works that is 
ah my bad many thanks with mockery close works nicely 
i ll try both of these suggestions i don t have an easy way to switch between versions of php in my dev environment at the moment so it might take a little while to get that set up 
hmmm well on one hand i would like the issue resolved but wouldn t like for you mates to destroy features because of it what about new names such as mock allows mockallows and mock expects mockexpects i know it s very corny anyone that then still falls into this issue would be much more limited rather than allows and expects which i could imagine is far more used than either of us know about alternatively each mock could be added a single gateway or proxy method which then could expose all mockery s api that should prevent 999 of all naming collisions yet that too would require major refactoring honestly i m not the most qualified to answer this perhaps you we should involve a few other opinions 
davedevelopment i am relying on the constructor arguments i pass in as i end up passing those into the calls my method will make under the hood a lot of my expectations are argument based which might be breaking the principle of black boxed tests a bit  i run the code and ensure child calls are made correctly w correctly formatted data or that we short circuit when needed i ended up just mocking out the other method calls made inside of my class which is just verbose but gets the job done i was just hoping that i could do something to what is possible with java s mockito where you can set up a spy and then mock entire method calls on it they have a separate api for method assertions vs setting up stubs however mockito when vs mockito verify 
ah sorry i didn t tell you that i was 02 on php 530 on mac os x

ubuntu 1004 does this really matter though i thought everything was good as long as i had an up to date ca bundle file i got mine from http curl haxx se ca cacert pem the fact that this works with c url curl makes me think faraday just needs to be made aware of the correct ca bundle file somehow 
hi pengwynn that works great and it doesn t seem to show the errors i received last time however i m getting different types of failures https gist github com rafalchmiel fa ddae bf e c 71 32fa1ddae588bf7e5c71 from the octokit client events octokit client gists and octokit client organizations modules any ideas on why i m getting these failures https gist github com rafalchmiel fa ddae bf e c 71 32fa1ddae588bf7e5c71
well it was just a suggestion there are many gems shipping the tests so from distributions po v pov it s just matter of running gem deb gem2deb to create a working package for the gem otherwise people has to go to github look at the releases and manually download zip or tarballs to package things 
yes i tried string literals inside my app as well as in irb no fa 2fa for the account related to the login and pass supplied 
pengwynn passing private false solves the issue thanks 
dduponchel take a peek at https github com sheetjs test files blob master auto filter autofilter xlsx raw true generated by excel 2011 and note that directory entries do not show up at least according to zip vim this is true of zip files from 2007 2010 2011 and 2013 the quote which led me to conclude that excel wasn t generating individual folders comes from ecma 376 ecma376 part ii open packaging conventions section 9 package model subsection 911 part names 
dduponchel while you are at it can you rework the crc 32 crc32 table so that the values are 32 bit integers https github com dduponchel jszip blob async methods generated files dist jszip js l l 291 l226l291 for example the third element of the table is x ee e c 0xee0e612c which is interpreted as 3993919788 outside the set of values that can be stored in a stdint int t int32t pako explicitly computes the table https github com nodeca pako blob master lib zlib crc js crc32js in a way that ensures the results are 32 bit integers if you don t want to compute the table the simplest solution may be to append 0 to all of the values in the source

careful though zone does a lot of crazy stuff so it s certainly possible that the issue is with zone and not js zip jszip however zone is being used beaten on tested by a lot of people so one would hope that a problem like this would be noticed if it were indeed with zone 
thanks for the answer however my problem is still there with the method i tried i could see the progress in the console i added the console log metadata percent inside the update callback updatecallback now i see nothing in the console when i hit the save button after a while before the save prompt window appearing i see the progress in the console quickly also the change of the div s width that s probably because the for loops takes a long time to be finished rather than the time spent on zip generate async generateasync either i need web worker or divide the for loop into chunks with set timeout settimeout

absolutely sure it s there appledoc generates it but fails to add it to x code xcode documentation 
hi no it does not work if i restart xcode but if i delete the docset in xcode and then build it again br thomas am 19122012 um 1756 schrieb tomaz notifications github com 
thanks just wanted to make sure this was known for reference by others it is possible to run multiple versions of x code xcode side by side just download the old version and re name x code xcode app before dragging into applications and you can switch between them using xcode select from command line it s too awkward for me to have wanted to include it in our build system but worked for letting me manually build appledoc without messing up my x code xcode 51 environment 
as in the example above currently appledoc puts the whole method signature on a single line it would be more readable to print in on multiple lines like apple does 
thanks djanowski yes that works of course i can live with that should i close

pietern any idea how i could continue debugging here 
joshuaflanagan appreciate the response i m actually seeing something completely bizarre the more i look if i run in rails dev env it doesn t error but in test it does i can t find any meaningful difference aside from using fakeredis in test and i have no idea what rails could possibly have to do with it fakeredis doesn t seem responsible because it works correctly when i try it in dev env edit redis 320 redis rb 330
not at all this is related to opening a ticket at am 4am

indentkeys 000 f o o e 00
bounceme thanks for the quick reply here is the code i have been looking at  when i run gg g to indent the whole file the indentation affects the contents of the template literal in the above snippet the indentation is via spaces though i ve asked vim to use tabs for indentation and the spaces get converted to tabs my expectation was that the content of the template literal would be unchanged i am assuming that this related to vim javascript as it s the last thing to get loaded when vim loads up apologies if that is not a good thing to be doing i haven t specified any vim javascript specific settings in my vimrc 
it certainly looks better than my current implementation but in view of performance it is actually worse it s currently not a big problem for me but i could be with bigger matrices and additional unavoidable memory allocations for new vector double each time the lambda is passed can lead to measurable slow down because vectors vector storage with more than 85000 bytes 10600 doubles is not extremly large vector will be allocated on large object heap and will be collected by gc only in gen 2 gen2 collections the slowest and least frequent one and with possibility of hundreds of thousands allocations per second gc will be running and pausing execution of my code frequently i ran into this problem once in some other project and when i got rid of the extremely frequent construction of large objects my performance went up by more than 30 now you can avoid the allocations by doing something like this single thread implementation  if this kind i feel like there should be syntactically prettier solution for this of overloaded functions can be added to in addition to map functions you proposed for row column maps it should solve most problems i see best performance could be probably gained form something like matrix row add inplace rowaddinplace vector other you can probably get rid of memory copy operations m row i rowbfr and m set row setrow i out from my top most example but i am overoptimizing for no particular reason and it would add lot of method to matrix interface which is not very desirable 
for patch i mean a sub matrix submatrix like i do in the sample code i pasted previously basically you extract a series of sub matrixes submatrixes from the original matrix and apply the same function to all the submatrixes for example convolution http ufldl stanford edu tutorial images convolution schematic gif or pooling http ufldl stanford edu tutorial images pooling schematic gif this is for example extremely important in convolutional neural networks for computer vision and natural language processing some of the most common tasks are pointwise multiply each sub matrix submatrix by another matrix and sum all the elements in every result as you see in the first gif take the average of each sub matrix submatrix as in the second gif take only the maximum value of each sub matrix submatrix the results of those operations should all be matrices however i m not sure about what should be the return type of the invoked function since sometimes it is a decimal number and sometimes a matrix itself i already did some tests and this type of tasks benefit a lot from parallelisation almost x 38x performance boost going from singlethreaded to multithreaded by swapping the parallel for in the code i showed with a regular for

hmmm i think theres no error i just attached http www guj com br posts list java 15224207java 1163173 a small project to simulate the error but this time everything works the only change i had made is download depencencies libs manually rather then using maven maybe when getting the error my pom xml was wrong 
yes for sure i can t do it right now but as soon as possible i ll do it until then let me explain a little better imagine the following class public class car extends vehicle private string color  then imagine the following action path create car public void create car createcar car car  create logic then in order to create a car you need to request the following url http www website com br create car car color red the problem happens when you create a converter for vehicle if you make the very same request with a vehicle converter it doesn t work and you get a null pointer exception nullpointerexception 
yes we do thanks garcia jj
it s support of extended keys is on i ve installed it via homebrew 
i know how to get on my config its just that because i use terminal apps too much i get confused when switching between them the nmap feature is useful but i don t think thats a good way to use that everytime i forget a key is there any way to make the suggestion list smaller like only show the 2 first keys character then show the third if i use that shortcut for example map m d md move to download map md move to documents map mh move to home map mm move to music what i would like to try is having pressing a shortcut and only show m key first and if i press that the d d h m keys suggestion shows up this is how it works now but only the second part this way i could map a few keys to a shortcut and not be worried about the suggestion list 
i installed vifm git via the aur arch so i believe it is on that commit yes i enabled millerview with filepreviews and it crashes on scrolling past certain files a simple 28 byte text file for example

rake db schema load works without the gem ill give test env number 4 rake db schema load a try ill let you know 
grosser pr submitted i took a look into why this was happening since i hadn t noticed it with other gems after digging a bunch i found that there isn t a problem with the code the reason the tasks do not show up is because the gem is only in the development group in the gemfile in order for the tasks to appear it has to be outside of groups or in the test group in addition to development the reason why is something i don t yet understand but have compiled into a stack overflow stackoverflow question http stackoverflow com questions why 37013545why is rake t run with rails env test hopefully someone more familiar with rake and rails will answer it

no we didn t the only configuration parameter passed to the client is connection timeout with a value of 30 which is higher than the default this may not be interesting but i hacked the client a bit to try to read again at the moment the exception occurs and append the read string to the exception text i didn t take too many samples but the read string looked to be a few characters of valid output didn t actually verify anyway it wasn t empty edit another data point there s usually a whole bunch of error instances within about one second but nothing before or after it i realize this could point towards a problem in redis is there a way to rule out predis as the culprit other than rewriting the calls to use another language client 
i was just verifying it manually using the redis cli maybe because i am just plainly running the redis server from its source directory i ll try to pass a config file to the redis server and see what happens 
yes the issue is still present without persistant connexion

thanks for a great library in ruby 19 by default net http sets the read timeout to 60 around line 582 in lib net http rb but does not set the open timeout should have checked that yesterday so you are right for open timeout but to disable the read timeout you need to set read timeout to nil

no the problem is the opposite i want to have it encoded just to quot not a followup question is why you decided to escape it to and not to quot like the rest of the chars was it based on an actual need in some situation i couldn t find a test in your solution that actually tested it i only found the one that tested the character

thanks for the replies i was getting script error message from require jquery which is standard require js requirejs message saying there is some error in the script that it is trying to load i debugged further in the code and figured out that it was complaining about file structure mustache 052 dev version that i was using did not have amd support while the new version do as a result i had to make some changes in my require js requirejs config and everything works fine now sorry for the confusion 
sorry i knew why this problem happened
yes happens in ie 7 8 unsure if it s a jquery bug could well be just noticed it when implementing uniform and found a comment on your blog that fixed the issue 
it is not working for me
basically i dynamically switch some hidden inputs and the main issue here is that after using uniform it makes all inputs visible even hidden ones because it adds allways visible parent div no matter what 
i solved it it was a problem related to an error in another plugin
at the moment i choosed to not bring this value in the db just setting in as default this is not a solution but i think i will give a try next week further also the enter key in forms are not individuated as form submit when the input is the last in the list i managed the event with javascript keypress e which 13 the version of uniform was the one i took from the git hub 2 days ago i will give the test page or the solution next week hoping the nd 2nd thanks
it s tested on winodws 7 and appearing on firefox chrome and ie 10 ie10 and ie 10 ie10 in ie 9 ie9 mode unfortunately the jsfiddle page does not work well in ie 10 ie10 in ie 8 mode so i could not verify anything below version 9
i did with no luck i m afraid 
please use http jsfiddle net pixelxy jncfp 109 for example i want to make checkbox radio fields readonly so it wont change preselected values
i see the icon i can right click to see preferences but i do not see how to use it to jump somewhere with nautilus 
joelthelion agreed i think the latter represents the most flexible and simplistic option moving forward it s akin to the bash history to me good idea 
cool thanks although it still seems like the exit status is the right thing to check there shouldn t be much difference although it could mask a failure in autojump printing dirs that no longer exist 
2102 right from github i also tried the homebrew install which i believe was v 17 v17 indicated by a numbered folder that it was placed into i did not run the version command so i could be wrong on oct 31 2012 at 213 pm william ting notifications github com wrote 
saamalik using export is a good idea but i would recommend putting it in your own local user bash profile the effect should be the same alternatively you could create your own autojump saamalik sh in etc profile d that by nature of alphabetical ordering will be sourced after autojump that way your changes don t induce the creation of pacnew pacsave files and or blow your changes away on the next pacman update for now i m going to keep the symlink into my completion d directory but i think your solution is very good 
hi wting i ve reinstalled brew zsh and autojump i don t receive this error when opening a new zsh shell anymore still having this error when i execute a shell build command in sublime text the build file contains the following the error is exactly the same 
nope cannot reproduce the issue after install from source 
sorry i should have been clearer here s an example pre require mongo mapper  comment following line to trigger bug mongo mapper mongomapper database foobar mongo mapper mongomapper database pre when the line is commented you get a name error nameerror when you would expect to get the informative message about setting mongo mapper mongomapper database 
086 seems like it s probably been fixed on head though as almost all of callbacks rb has been replaced with some active support activesupport classes 
because i needed change the attributes and behaviors of my object in execute time not all objects of collection in mongodb needs have the same attributes and i m using this in my project the methods worked fine but the attributes didn t 
here s the way to reproduce it s definitely different at the orm level   code model with timestamps   scenario 1 start web server of production env at 20120119 010000 2 check articles recent and you will see no record 3 create a record of article 4 check articles recent again and you ll see a record at mm case besides ar returns no record 
again something like an enum type would need access to the list of values available to it
given rails ruby 3211ruby p 290 192p290 not sure what to make out of this behavior 
hi fanto well its not an issue for me but i think 2 things can happen 1 we ll lose clicks because the visitor won t be able to scan the url on sr whos responsible for service design whos responsible 20responsible for 20for service 20service design 20design  google shows like that 2 links sent on some programs chat email etc with break cause of the blankspace since most of the entrance come from search engines title url meta description are things we need to pay double attention 
i have a goodish intuition the good sight is really git bisect s i didn t even identify the change that brought up the issue i don t really know how to test this but if you tell me i ll do it 
strange because i installed zinnia with  when i found the problem removed it and checked if the directory was removed from site packages the installed it again with the same command and every time i do that every time fails on collectstatic when i installed it from github everything was fine and this happens on two different machines 
just i changed the j query jquery java script javascript library from v 142 v142 to 152 and no action on submit button 
no thats working fine no error i have it in my working system using your plugin in eqdkpplus for comments if you know that project tried to update to 172 and did not work not sure why 
example http zhuykov ru example jquery form php
sure i d be happy to share my changes besides having the changes committed to my branch are you suggesting another way for me to give you my fix https github com vykluong form git
i think that it makes sense of using only the j query jquery method for serializing arrays as it is doing other stuffs as well and if there are changes later to it we will get automatically an updated version and only j query jquery will be responsible for the encoding and not j query jquery form anymore i don t think that for this case we need both issues one of those should be sufficient but i would prefer using the serialize array serializearray j query jquery method and letting all the responsibility to j query jquery implementing both solutions should not break things further but it will add additional overhead i would say it is up to the maintainer to decide which is better 
wanna add custom response especially on failed request

not an error but supress warnings if occur one using array key exists just returns true or false no warning is triggered remember php is retarded like you said many times inside shimmie source
i think that the essence of the problem is lack of synchronization standard generic dictionary class does not guarantee thread safety the run with null reference exception nullreferenceexception also shows that something s up 
more interesting observations  usually a delay when i first hover over the variable or inspect a property value  seems intermittent i e time seems to affect things for example i just failed to view a property but while typing this reply i switched back to debug sessions and i can see the property value very strange  seems it doesn t fail on all properties sometimes the first two properties fail but the rest display ok inspect again and all work  some of the types referenced on the proxied interface are from a net standard 11 project not sure if that s relevant i can always see the internals e g interceptors target etc confirmed apparently same behavior between vs 2015 vs2015 and vs 2017 vs2017 i m debugging using resharper n unit nunit test runner 20163

alexandrnikitin thank you for the documentation we are running most our tests in parallel via n unit nunit console runner i ll be sure to audit the places we are seeing the exception bubble up to make sure we are configuring n substitute nsubstitute outside of test execution to avoid issues fwiw this is the only case we have run into issues with threading it seems like that lazy thread safety mode lazythreadsafetymode should be either publication only publicationonly or execution and publication executionandpublication if the long term goal is to support better thread safety the auto value providers factory autovalueprovidersfactory constructor is an interesting pattern as it creates a self referencing loop 
used by users nico rvm rubies ruby p lib 192p290lib ruby test 191test unit assertions rb in 143in assert respond to so it seems test unit is still used allthough its not in my gem file maybe some other gem has it as a dependency well i guess i can track down the call to assert respond to in my tests however i don t use that directly 
thanks will look into ensure i understand that is the purpose of assertion which works great when checks are dependent of each other the checks that we are doing are independent of each other and is part of similar test type so it makes sense to test it in group at such point 
thanks ab 9 ab9 and bhenderson for your examples that helped me a lot smile 
do you mean rails x 23x i was using rails x 32x 
see pull request 266 which moves the pride io prideio and pride lol pridelol classes into the mini test minitest namespace 
this fails for me 
i dove back into the zeus source and got a fix merged in thanks for the help ryan https github com burke zeus pull 347
i have this alarm system where an alarm starts a thread each alarm has different procs i just wanted to test out that the proc really gets called and gets called only once since each alarm can repeat lots of times but the thread should be started only once my workaround was to catch the exception in the proc and exit right there maybe just put some guidance on the readme so people knows how it works with threads 
require inherited callbacks not sure but minitest is probably too far down the river to change this this seems more profitable but how would you scope it not all minitest plugins start with mini test i presume the rails one doesn t i guess 
utilum i want to test the stability of my web service 
investigating better is the same problem as 730 but they released a fix for rails 51 in rails rails 31624 not 50 could you add a fix to it in rails 50 for now i locked the minitest version to 5103 and it works well 
i have test cases where i need to break it down into smaller methods private or not i m aware it might not be the best test design i hope to get there one day in the meantime the assumption that the assertion will always reside in main test method seems to be a little too restrictive 
yep that should work i m not sure how many projects currently use fein cms feincms and reversion together since i m the first one to mention it  might be simpler to just implement the new template for fein cms feincms 16 and let current projects use the workaround described above

i added a very simple server based on the node example but i somehow can t get it to work properly when trying to access http faye 00009293faye it doesn t respond i guess my setup is wrong though i installed the recent faye version via npm and the server starts and also responds with bad request when accessing http 00009293 if this simple example works for you than i guess i m just missing something i d be glad to provide more help on resolving that issue 
some certificates are signed by certificate authorities that are not directly in the list of trusted certificate issuers to verify these certificates an intermediate certificate or multiple are needed that go up the certificate chain until it reaches a known good certifcate authority root certificate you are right this is not mentioned in the nodejs documentation at http nodejs org docs latest api https html https create server createserver however one sentence there the options is similar to tls create server createserver points to this documentation http nodejs org docs latest api tls html tls create server createserver i also found this discussion http groups google com group nodejs browse thread thread b d cfbd d 2b9d788224cfbd3d which points out that the ca property of the options to https create server createserver is indeed supported the patch above adds code to faye s listen method so that the ca option is supported and passed along to https create server createserver 
hi i really thanks for your time but i dont need your help now i just rollback a previous source and start again thanks anyway 
i used http localhost i am using expressjs x 2x but i dont attach the server to the expressjs 
absolutely it s not a bug faye side i just open this case for information and memory node fluent ffmpeg have to be refactored gdc function must be in a namespace not a prototype of an object  
no i don t control document url or encoding i include my client js with bundled faye library to third party websites so i cannot change encoding or the way how they create their ur ls urls and for example there is a page with nadpis sedac ed vaky 20vaky in query string and this ed breaks it when faye tries to establish connection i don t use faye uri parse directly this website s encoding is cp 1250 cp1250 world would be happier if everyone uses utf 8

hey thanks for the reply i was able to sort of the issue myself i suggest you update the csrf protection doc stuff on the site seems newer versions of rails simply dont let you compare the token direct it takes some manipulation  also ive changed my personal usage of this to an if instead of an unless for some reason with the unless it doesnt seem like the client ever gets told no and it simply keeps trying spamming the webserver 
interesting the same effect sorry for the noise i ll report it on the lua te x luatex mailing list 
i just tried updating but the problem is still there 
my trouble was that it was still utilising older packages located in the user partition while the mik te x miktex console was updating packages in the system partition 
yes consider this example you create a view you get a hud for that view using show hud added to showhudaddedto next you get the same pointer to the hud using the hud for view hudforview method and then you issue a hud hide at this point if you rotate the screen of your device the draw rect drawrect method in the mb progress hud mbprogresshud is called and if the dim background dimbackground property is set to true even the background is redrawn this leads to slowdowns especially when on retina displays on i pads ipads 
nope exactly what i did was to remove hud before adding alertview 
thanks that works but it should be disabling interaction on the hud hud set user interaction enabled setuserinteractionenabled no 
by cocoapods 
i know you don t use any private api s however you use method names like hide that are private api method names this makes the build get flagged by apple you should know that when i removed your product and used another one i did not have my builds rejected 
just add let loading notification loadingnotification mb progress hud mbprogresshud show hud added to showhudaddedto self view animated true loading notification loadingnotification mode mb progress hud mode mbprogresshudmode indeterminate loading notification loadingnotification label text labeltext loading but i m not placing this code on main thread maybe thats the issue should i place it in gcd s main queue

no problem 
the same error occurred after i added the line require jruby openssl gem only 
geemus i m not following your idea can you paste a snippet that would demonstrate how it would work 
in fog fog 3246 we decided to simply rescue with nil btw i discovered that this was mainly user error fog was trying to upload my pipe in a single request which s 3 s3 doesn t support as it needs a content length the solution was to use multipart upload in fog so excon is not in fact to blame for this however it might still be a good idea to rescue with nil as this will allow pipes and sockets to go through to any services that might accept content length 0
if it were up to me i would add this feature to excon middleware redirect follower redirectfollower but it feels not so right to add redirect request number in valid keys because it s not suppose to be configured or may be it could be useful in some cases to access it in response object 
but the redirect could be to a location that also requires auth assuming the same domain and realm the only way to know for sure is to try without auth first then if you get 401 retry with auth if it s secure i believe all browsers work like that 
could excon remember the encoding and set it back to the original after the request that would avoid duplicating the string 
i can understand the reluctancy it isn t necessarily your problem that the mongoid team decided to abandon the bson ext and mongo gems it would have been nice if they could have made it work even with those gems required by other ones it seems like this move will break a lot of other gems too from my experimentation and research mongoid 3 refuses to operate if those gems are used maybe i should post the request on the mongoid issue page or maybe we can create a mongoid 3 mongoid3 compatible datastore and place the mongo related datastores in separate gems thank you for your time i enjoy using dragonfly so much i would rather stick with mongoid 2 until this is all figured out

we have a model with a has many relation with a database foreign key constraint postgres in our case on our model has many association we have dependent restrict with error which handles catching the dependent error apparently before the destroy happens to cause this issue you can remove the dependent option altogether and let the database constraint cause a failure and rollback thanks

mhh well i think it is a bug you are calling get players getplayers in order to get player information internally it s calling rcon status and parses this so there s no need of doing s a s2a player before this ddos protection is now standard on all vanilla servers as long as it s not disabled these are the rcon commands

you are right that s the better solution however if in future we can see the private messages within foodsoft it would be nice for users to clean up those by deleting unwanted messages in the case of public messages i understand that deletion is problematic 
say there s a user which might or might not belong to a group class user extends active record activerecord base static belongs to array array group  class group extends active record activerecord base  i want to print all user names with their group names users user all foreach users as user  print user name if user group id null print user group name  however this will use lazy loading to get the group of each user let s optimize it users user all array joins  array group but now the built join will exclude all the users with no group replacing it with a left join will be perfect for the above code 
yes on the server this code is deployed to running select sql mode returns  from what i could tell it looks like strict trans tables is the option causing the transactions to abort as the datetime format with timezone are is what the mysql datetime data type is expecting when not in strict mode timezones are automatically converted to the timezone of the database server it looks like this might have to be done in php otherwise thanks dave on apr 21 2012 at 559 pm yoan blanc wrote

aha that page links to https bugzilla mindrot org show bug cgi id 1340 which in turn at the bottom links to http tools ietf org id draft kanno secsh camellia txt 01txt and searching the ietf website finally leads to a slightly newer version of that draft https tools ietf org html draft kanno secsh camellia 02 the newer draft has no actual content changes and it also expired on august 1 2011 on a technical level this looks like somebody copy pasted parts of the aes cipher specs and replaced aes by camellia resp aes by camellia  not that this is necessarily a bad thing mind you still i wonder what happened various other camellia based rfc made it to standards track but this one just died ah well

ok you are right on this thank you if i write to a file i can see that my code is called what made me think it wasn t working in the first place was that breakpoint were not working but it seems breakpoint are working every second times i debug the module it works one time out of two and the console are accumulating themselves i am playing with eunit coverage tracing and until now i wasn t able to make anything works i tough these problems were all related to the same issue but it seems it is not the case if the console output is not reliable how am i supposed to see the output of eunit tests 
oops i did configure a runtime but i just found out that default runtime checkbox wasn t checked sorry for bothering on this non issue

yep escaping the character solved it though i suppose it should probably do the escape in the script if possible catching the error and printing a message might be nice as well just some thoughts thanks ghan

turns out the issue was because the max size maxsize was configured to mb 1mb but the cache values were greater than that got fixed once the max size maxsize was changed 
what is the default distribution cache server limits if i want to increase 46 what needs to be done each connection limit is it 20it works fine for 4 server and if we configure 6 th one randamoly disconnecting from one of the server 
if memcached running on centos 61 we don t know how to run those tests you must have a suit of test that covers all the api right would you test them with centos 61 thanks

sorry for the unclear question with flat file as was referring to a physical file that actually exists in the files system in contrast to a pattern that will be expanded to no one or multiple files 
i did not understand this part you mean on unit test you will replace to to match with result is that if yes is a good idea i opened a topic on so to listen someone about test unit in all systems http stackoverflow com questions running 28918855running node tests in all systems without have it
these are with mocha first test will hang glob callback for the path test test 1 test1 two others will timeout after 2 seconds standard mocha timeout 
isaacs what i m hoping for is a way to use it to generate my file lists so i can pipe them to other commands inside of my package json npm run scripts doing that here would require adding the bin property inside of package json and writing an additional interface file just like how es lint eslint https github com eslint eslint does it check their package json and bin folder then it would be possible to do things like scripts  my npm run script glob js  a command  or use it directly on the command line if it s installed globally by npm thoughts i d be willing to take this on over the weekend as i m going to need it either way  edit well now i feel kind of silly that i just tried explaining how to do it to one of the core founders of npm xd if you have another recommendation rather than adding command support to do what i want to do i m all ears my alternative is to just write a wrapper library if you don t want to support it officially here

chester 89 chester89 net core consists of multiple components new runtime new compiler and new bcl all of them support net 45 as target framework so you can port your library to this new platform but still target net 45 if you want to target cross platform netcoreapp 10 netcoreapp10 or netstandard you have to change your codebase because these targets don t support all of net 45 features 
chester 89 chester89 yes i know it s not possible to detect encoding of a database in fluent i already suggested above that solution would be to add length property to index part indexpart the same as element part elementpart has so we can in automapping set length for this column to 191 in this case 
gleb yes pretty sure i downgrade nh back to 4014000 via nuget in my solution and re run the test and the problem is gone done it a few times fluent nh fluentnh is latest stable 203 net 452
 can you get backtrace as usual gdb s backtrace facility is not very helpful for assembly language code  i usually need a lot of single stepping stepi nexti in order to debug assembly language code 
iirc i wasn t updating the value through the property but attempting to call the function instead so 
yes apologies i should have done that initially i m working on it now and of course my minimal example works fine it might take me a bit to identify what aspect of my architecture is triggering the issue i have found that the issue occurs when the server is run in python 2712 but not when it is run in python 352 rpyc 340 in both cases and it only occurs after a client connects i ll keep working on a minimal example 
i ve done some more digging and found the root cause my system is running a server queue rpyc and a worker daemon that queries the queue for data i made a change recently that caused the rpyc connection to be copied to processes spawned by the worker so the worker and all processes were using the same connection instance i fixed the issue by having each spawned process create its own rpyc connection instead of sharing it closing this issue as ebkac 
stefankroes added is as in your docs  getting the same error 
thanks superclarkk kind of sort of but not really what i really need is to refresh a subset not all open just a few quick tabs so to speak because refreshing 80 or more tabs at once would not make my computer happy i don t think she cries under the load of fat assed chrome as it is bloated memory leaking sieve that it is i do not need to further kick her while she s down the other thing is they re not necessarily grouped in a same window more typically they ll just be the same domain sub domain i looked at the linked and some similar extensions none quite tick all the boxes for me plus i think it s a great functional fit for qt and something that will attractive to that specific set of users who like me have tons of tabs and frequently get timed out of one site or another 
ah fantastic thanks for the tip it took a browser restart but qt is jumping again 
anecdotally yes but i wasn t paying attention enough to say for sure that both issues always happened together

an example from my project we support that a user can use functions to evaluate values in documents there are about a dozen of different functions which can be used in over 20 different places no we have x 20 12x20 specs for this with examples we could melt the specs down to 20 specs each with 12 examples the different functions typical cases from the literature are  examples for calculating parking lot pricing min 5min x min 15min x min 20min y  example for discount calculations examples help communication with non technical people too 
awesome here is the run with cohttp lwt 
you re right in that it doesn t happen on the current release of psych 122 from what i can tell but you need to declare the gem dependency or it won t happen if active record activerecord listed psych as a dependency this would ve been avoided because presumably it would have fetched the most recent version the one bundled with ruby p 290 192p290 is sadly broken it has to be manually added in the gemfile to fix this ruby p 0 193p0 is bundled with psych 121 which produces a slightly different error but at least no hard crash  the 122 version is fine in 193 though thanks for the prompt reply it would be great if the next build of 193 will have 122 or better bundled with it as this is probably going to hit more than a few unsuspecting people 
possibly with some utf 8 flags
thanks i upgraded rubygems but the problem persisted i eventually resorted to going to a backup disk for my virtual machine i m running ubuntu on oracle virtual box virtualbox before i had seen your suggestion sorry i should have updated my issue but it was a maddening several days trying to fix the problem i ll make sure to try updating bundler and rubygems if i see this issue again thanks for responding 
lha thanks for your response i checked both the files that seem to be ok i updated my workspace but still the problem is the same i did make distclean to ensure that the autogenerated files are cleared up not sure why the definition is in two places 
if i don t have a keytab for a user then i guess that gss acquire cred with password is the only method to obtain credentials for the first time then i would like to store them somewhere in order to avoid making a request to the kdc the next time for example a gss store cred that would store it into the default cache especially so since my application is a web server that has to get tickets for thousands of users my idea was to create a cache per user principal to keep a map user cache and to set the cache of user x as the default cache whenever a request is made for the user x gss krb ccache krb5ccache name followed by gss acquire cred 
hmm i see the semantic checker only cares about the logical operation so that if a a is the same as if a the original code is correct although the way it s written is somewhat confusing my error

yes i have the build tools unless some new dependencies have been added in the new version the previous version installed without any problem 
great they re working thanks flori 
i ve tried to find it but without any luck i think it was some invalid byte sequence like x 0 x0
this required for make of a book 
yes
pehr git pehrgit no i just changed my class bar provider barprovider to use generics something like bar provider barprovider t key tkey t value tvalue which has a concurrent dictionary concurrentdictionary and get and create methods and in ninject config ninjectconfig i m using like this  i would like to ninject do this for me but i noticed last release of ninject was long time ago and i think the maintainers could take too much time to release another version so i did it myself and closed the issue

setting path solved it thanks 
because there are multiple kinds of warnings the user would want to enable or disable 
that would be ok the whole point is of tiny mode is to remove those assumptions and allow code to be packed tightly across the whole k 32k area including the k 16k boundary a k 32k rom is not supposed to use bank switching anyway if you want those assumptions to hold the correct solution is to use the standard mode only allowing sections placed in bank 1 to be aliased was meant to be a conservative implementation and is not strictly necessary rgbds originally did not have that restriction and to be clear in either case romx sections without an explicit bank declaration should always be allowed one little winkle is what should bank return in my opinion again to be conservative is that maybe it should actually always return 1 reasoning if there is code for bank switched calls which there shouldn t be but if there is a value of 1 would give the smallest likelyhood of crashing the code if it runs on a cartridge with a mbc of some kind writing 1 to 2000 will then select the bank that should have been permanently selected anyway 
yes as far as i can tell no whitespace is required bra  1 is a syntax error
sorry for my mistake i am using rails 3 beta 2 beta2 in gemfile i missing the version of rspec rspec rails so the bundle installed rspec 13 which not support rails 3 rails3 now i mark the bundle rspec quired version beta 200beta 5 and bundle install again everything is perfect here is my gemfile   bundle gems used only in certain environments gem rspec beta 200beta 5 group test group test do gem webrat gem rspec rails beta 200beta 5 gem cucumber gem capybara git git github com jnicklas capybara git gem database cleaner git git github com bmabey database cleaner git gem cucumber rails git git github com aslakhellesoy cucumber rails git end sorry for that i should google the answer before i created the issue 
not directly but just to let you know in cucumber rails installation it s indicated when using rails 3 before you can use the generator add the necessary gems to your projects gemfile as follows gem capybara gem database cleaner gem cucumber rails gem cucumber gem rspec rails gem spork gem launchy  so you can do then show me the page it was working very well with rails beta 4 beta4 but since upgrading to rails rc 3rc it fails i suppress it from the gemfile and bundle install is running well now i tried to run a gem install launchy in my console and got also an error error error installing launchy invalid gem format 
not more than this sorry 
thanks aslakhellesoy i have no idea why this has been posted here sorry for the inconvenience 
we take the gem install it and run the test suite even though if we would not be using the gem we would be using tarball for example but the issue remains we cannot do checkout from git since the build is done offline

vinoski i have just created a plt file with using the yaws master thank you 
leoliu vinoski thank you i ve read the manual and building web apps with erlang in his book zachary uses exactly the same content mime type mimetype content return value for generating json my example is extremely basic i know but in real world scenario that missing feature might be more meaningful right and as a bonus it would be nice to have a consistent behaviour between out 1 module out 4043 out4043 and our guy 
sorry i see that i have to use check key value not simply key value is this documented somewhere also i would suggest making it the default 
i send a http request and got the body a then i json decode json2decode a and got a error then i write a test to decode it  beacase it is a test so i don t test the range of low surrogate code points

yes i tried database cleaner databasecleaner mongoid strategy truncation it failed now i am using v 052 v052 with config database cleaner databasecleaner orm mongoid database cleaner databasecleaner strategy truncation it works 
yes it would have to take multiple connection hashes but that work work 
i m using ar 3211 option 1 would have a negative impact because every activerecord object that was touched needs to be rolled back if we are using database cleaner for testing chances are that all those objects are going to get thrown away and never used so there s no point in touching them i will try adding rollback transaction records in our tests to estimate the performance impact our tests are not very consistent in run times so an estimate is the best that i can do 
ok

hi happy to help just try struct http parser url u char url test http parser parse url url strlen url 0 u  the problem is that the processor assumes that there is still input available after the state machine changes from schema to next one
its part of a larger library that is mostly header only i m looking to convert the last bits of it that require translation units come to think of it it might not be possible to make the parser header only using only c it would require c so i can see why that might be a non starter i appreciate the response 
i should have included a test case in the first case i cannot reproduce it either at this time the next time i encounter this behaviour i ll make a test case 
thanks for looking into it i can t reproduce it today using firefox v 39 i don t know what version i was using when i noticed the problem unfortunately so possibly a firefox update fixed it i ll re open if i see the problem again

i found a fix apple fiscal calendar applefiscalcalendar m line 35 while period 100 replace 100 number of month since 2008 with a larger figure eg 120
convenience so i only need to load one package
the same as grepl return true if the string is a character or even always true 
reinstalled r devel for windows removed 35 library installed stringr and the same issue r crashes  second try created a virtual machine with debian 9 compiled r devel from sources installed stringr and it works without any issue note i ve tried the windows version in my pc and my notebook both failed note 2 note2 it is not only an issue with stringr for example shiny also crashes shiny run example runexample reactivity 03reactivity also crashes under debian 9 it runs perfect so i guess there is something wrong with the windows release of r devel that affects several packages

hi the issue can be seen on this demo http consumer easyxdm net current example upload html if you look at in safari 5 on the mac make sur that your status bar is visible at the bottom and you ll see that it hangs on x 1 of x resources loaded i have tracked down the issue to the test for name property bug testfornamepropertybug function the problem is that safari sees sourceless iframe and tries to load about blank as resource this load never finishes and thus it hangs forever stupid not sure how you d want to fix this i will just throw in a check for safari and not run the routine in that case safari doesn t have the name issue so it shouldn t need the check

hi herxox in fact is just a cosmetic issue the data is correct but maybe as a matter of convention you did not include the code for other countries so maybe the se yaml file could follow the same convention as others it currently looks like ab name stockholms ln se 01 names stockholms ln se 01 and should probably be ab name stockholms ln names stockholms ln as is the case for other countries like fr de us 
it seems that it works today  it was maybe the order of mongoid gem and your gem many thanks for your time 
hm it seems countries gem had some progress in the last years i am using a custom branch with some subdivisions added by myself in order to switch to the actual hexorx version all of these subdivisions should be merged into the original one yours is that possible to make a pull request all my added stuff is conform to the one of hexorx 
i found that changing type country to type iso country iso3166country helps i suppose it is all about namespace and it is not a bug at all but reqiures some changes in models code to be compactable with new version of the gem

beyond some of the basic benefits of docker repeatable installations and deployment isolation from other processes i ve found it most useful if you want to use roundhous e roundhouse within a larger docker deployment for example within a docker compose  note that this doesn t mean that installation of roundhous e roundhouse in the docker image couldn t leverage the net core tools installation option i built my image before that option was available

i was not able to reproduce the issue myself either i tried send multiple update event one after another but that always results in 400 or s 404s i m not really sure when or why s 204s are happening my assumption is that it could be a race condition where the server accepts the update event and verifies that that task is updatable but when it comes time to update it cannot be updated because something moved it to a delete or a un updatable state since s 204s are returned for deletes if you can help look into when and why s 204s are being return that would be great does your api team have an idea why this is happening

emcrisostomo i use fsw monitor type system default monitor type you re correct in the sequence you mentioned above hence i d assume the lower latency set via set latency function would reduce the time spent in while active monitor is running loop after issuing active monitor stop this is not the case as i mentioned above in my previous comment even if i reduce the latency from f 01f to f 0001f i see no significant difference it still roughly ends up spending 400 600 ms in the loop

from a linux distribution packaging point of view we always encourage upstream vendors to include a copy of the license that their software is licensed under the lack of a license isn t a dealbreaker so it s completely up to you alternatively you could put the license text at the bottom of the readme it s only 15 lines or so

just like this 
the text says to create a class  you can add methods and attributes to this class when you create it and you can perform introspection on the class with the metaclass the object which represents that class returned from the create constructor similarly you can create and manipulate and introspect attributes and methods with class mop attribute and class mop method  the example could be extended with the creation of one method and one attribute and the usage of the new monkey wrench class it should be a working boot strap to motivate to learn more from the class mop documentation which seams overwhelming at a first read

the closest i could find is http bugs python org issue 5573 issue5573 which you even commented on notice in that case poll returns true because there s data to read but in my example it never returns true because no data has been sent so if you don t ever call recv you don t get the eof error eoferror an if you do call recv it just hangs i worked around this by patching the pipe to check for a parent pid change in poll and raise an eof error eoferror in that case but a proper fix might be needed so that poll detects that the other end of the pipe is closed couldn t find anything in the documentation for pipes on linux that would suggest this is possible though

compctl is a zsh builtin so bash doesn t find it  compctl bash compctl command not found echo 127 i am guessing that bash is failing because it wants good bash syntax when it tries to parse the false if block after it executes the first compctl even though it doesn t intend to run the block if you don t have an old bash can you try changing it so it s a syntax error for new bash like precmd functions z precmd and try running that in a new bash that fails in my recent linux bash release 42251release even though it s in the zsh side of the if compctl

thanks phillbaker we re running ruby on rails with unicorn yes each process has its own database connection they are pooled sequentially using pgbouncer in front of postgres but this shouldn t matter for concurrent queries we have our own back end asynchronous system https github com stangel sweatshop but moving the track call to those back end servers won t make a difference if the waiting locks are causing the connection pool to be exhausted after some consideration i think i ll monkey patch l 139 l139 to only update the timestamp if more than a minute has passed i e  this preserves the functionality more or less while avoiding the concurrency problem

the old lib plugins discussion version indicates it is 20090822 edit which doesn t seem to be the best way to check for the version because the version file in the updated plugin also has the same date the info button on the plugin management page indicates that the plugin has been installed fri 08 oct 2010 and this is the first time for me to update the plugin so i guess whatever version has been around at that time is what has been installed edit 2 edit2 it appears to me that the threads that have disappeared from the page are those that have identical timestamps with other threads

i like the idea of defining the gc settings in the environment but it turns out that this really isn t achievable after some trial and error i started searching and came across this post http blog phusion nl passing 20081216passing environment variables to ruby from phusion passenger given the wrapper seems necessary there are two features that moonshine would need to support to automate this 1 make passenger ruby passengerruby in passenger conf erb a configurable variable default can still be usr bin ruby 2 add a recipe to create the wrapper script with settings that could be provided in moonshine yml or the app manifest it seems like item 1 would be best to change in moonshine itself and it would be backwards compatible item 2 i m not sure if it s better off as a plugin or part of moonshine i guess it depends on how many people would want to customize these gc settings i see it as critical given the huge performance boost i received by tweaking the gc settings but perhaps that s just me

thank you for the comments differences encountered up to now are  skipping the autoreconf step in traditional build since make dist produces a tar with the configure script while a checkout from git does not but this is mainly to speedup the build and avoid extra dependencies  difference in the setup macro something like setup q n lowercasename version vs setup q because the ant tweak bar anttweakbar package has uppercase letters in the name not my choice and autoconf lowercases the directory in the tar file while tito keeps the full original name dgoodwin i ll propose a patch thanks 
have you tried emacs for mac os x http emacsformacosx com 
i ve played around with this quite a bit but it doesn t seem to work here s what i tried 1 m x set variable ret package check signatures ret allow unsigned 2 m x package refresh contents it still tries to check signatures on the gnu archive i m not sure if that s a bug then i tried manually importing the gnu elpa keyring updated package but this didn t help either 
well the thinking was simply to be able to override the defproc on attributes which we are doing currently for lazy bulk load or also perhaps have this be something other than a hash in any case it s just a good practice to allow the client to create the container also i was eyeing how to implement serialized without overriding or replacing ohm model attribute declarator since you call cast this is sufficient if cast is a proc or convertible to a proc thus we could parameterize the serializer per attribute as currently suggest you add args as a third parameter to the attribute declarator and also use class eval to define the accessors rather than define method since class eval called methods benchmark much faster 
that worked i also tried installing ruby preview 1 ruby260preview1 which worked too 
using responders 110
good catch lucasmazza looks like that resolved the problem thanks for looking further i hadn t had a chance to chase it down yet 
yes i tried it but the behavior was same
sorry about no error was just completely tired out anyway based on your note i tried again and discovered that due to some other issues i was actually running with ocra 120 even though the gem list said i had 130 now that i am really running with 130 all seems well

i m sorry if i ve confused you i must admit that i did some edits to my original comments posted above as and when i found out new things the real issue turned out to be with inner html innerhtml replaces in ie if the html is malformed such as nested form tags etc http jadendreamer wordpress com internet 20090602internet explorer fix unknown runtime error using innerhtml ajax then the behavior is unpredictable in ie in my case i was using lab right after doing an inner html innerhtml replace a lot of things were unpredictable after doing that replace such as console statements not showing up alerts not showing up but surprisingly the subsequent js code lab was being executed albiet in an unpredictable fashion

i simply followed the instructions in vim dispatch help let g nremap  and the vim dispatch mappings were gone it was only a little later that i noticed the vim unimpaired mappings were also gone i don t use vim dispatch directly but i keep it around for vim fugitive as of about three weeks ago it added a normal mode mapping for d and movements like space and enter which i happen to use for now i ve forked vim dispatch and added a g dispatch default mappings option which will disable all mappings without messing with g nremap

thanks for the quick response i wasn t aware that this is expected behaviour so basically you rename the todo txt file to todo txt bak and create a new todo txt file linking the directory would be a possibility which i will try out i just would have preferred linking the individual files since i ve other stuff in there too i find the way it works counter intuitive but maybe i m alone there

i have found the file you mentioned i have removed the file it starts to index and when it s busy it gives the lock error again when it s almost done it also says it can t open data access log a file from the logstats plugin right after that it gives the error that tagindexer is locked edit it seems an incompatability when the plugin searchstats is installed as well i have disabled that plugin and the indexing went fine now 
ok so dw pdf dw2pdf worked i actually tried that before but it appears unless you update the file on the server changes magically don t show we want to use the html export to embed the contents and formatting into semi static html pages with a completely different style this is very hacky at the moment and is based on a previous implementation with jsp wiki jspwiki which is ugly as hell i think i can live without suppressing the tags in the html for now thanks for your quick response

the image extractor rb uses graphics magick which indeed supports specified page extraction unfortunately the page extractor rb or the corresponding docsplit pages docsplit extract pages command uses pdftk which does not support specified page extraction it really isn t that high of a concern as i believe i have an extremely unique scenario but the online documentation http documentcloud github com docsplit claims that it does support specifying a page range if you d like i could write a test that fails but i m still researching the best way to include support for this

sure look at this gist http gist github com 343796 the flow is like this 1 you access users controller userscontroller login 2 it calls authenticate and calls failure app with form containing openid url field 3 you fill it with foo and submits 4 rack open id openid calls next app warden 5 warden s openid strategy kicks in and returns 401 6 rack open id openid tries to contact given invalid url but it gets exception so it sets env rack openid response to missing reponse object and calls next app which is warden again 7 warden sees that it was called previously and thinks there are cascaded wardens so it just calls its next app which is rails action containing authenticate 8 authenticate throws halt which is not caught anymore and i get 500 i hope that helps

hey arsandov we already had a custom deploy strategy inheriting from heroku san herokusan deploy base so we ve opted to replace our calls to heroku san herokusan api methods that at the moment rely on method missing with calls to heroku san herokusan api sh method and directly use the heroku cli in the deployment machine for example replacing api post app maintenance app 1 with api sh app maintenance on our strategy did not have much exposure to the broad api so this was a fairly quick task i think we ll stick to this as long as the future of heroku san remains unclear 
the sanitize api works fine it didn t seem very dry to me at first but the more i think it through the more i appreciate the choices they made

no it seems to work under nginx native i suspect it has something to do with the modified headers module used by tengine that allows you to set expires by type that is just a guess of course but it has similar functionality in that it changes the expires headers based upon mime type i will open an issue there since they strive to be 100 nginx compatible which in this case does not appear to be true 
it appears that turning on ngx pagespeed directly attributes to the server header being shown without it the header does not show with it turned on the header does show

my data is not incompressible i just used random data for benchmark purposes we used lzo to compress huge hbase table but one day i compared table compaction speed with the same data but without compression lzo was significantly slower 45 times iirc as a workaround we migrated to snappy but i still curious why lzo gives such large overhead on random data i expect to get max 1020 slowdown but not 300

we re running rails 32 i get the can t mass assign protected attributes var target error i was looking at this commit specifically settings object rb https github com ledermann rails settings commit fd dffca f e c b c cfa fb f 18fd6dffca3f6e191c8b6c19657cfa14fb55670f in the prior version the check for the rails version would have executed that condition now since it was replaced with the check for protected attributes protectedattributes which we re not using it no longer executes that may not be relevant but at a glance it was the first thing that stood out 
i really can t tell if it is counter intuitive i did expect the hooks to run but maybe just because i had really simple app with no first time setup and would have been surprised if it were the other way around the problem is that if setting up a new server and there will not be any commits e g to the release branch soon enough i would need a way to run the hooks on first deploy maybe a git deploy run hooks r production action to the binary

hi tim sorry if i wasn t clear it doesn t relate to the cause of the error but does relate to the reporting of the error in the script s exit code i tried changing the two exit code exitcode occurrences to exit code which appears 10 times in the code and the script now returns an error code of 1 when there is an error response from aws

hi martijn i have to confess that i have not tried to use it i think at very minimum it would need a nuget package that targets dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 the new small cross platform framework when you create an asp net 5 project in vs 2015 rc the new project types target dnx 451 dnx451 which is equivalent to desktop framework and dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 which is the new small cross platform framework as soon as you try to use something not supported in dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 you get errors but you could solve them by only targeting dnx 451 dnx451 i think people can still use mvc 5 and mvc paging mvcpaging with dnx 451 dnx451 but they cannot target dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 with mvc 5 so i suspect the same for mvc paging mvc 6 can run on either dnx 451 dnx451 or dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 but i think the cool kids are going to want to use dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 to target dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 some big pieces are gone or changed if mvc paging mvcpaging uses anything from system web or system configuration those do not exist in dnxcore 50 dnxcore50 but there are new more flexible config classes in microsoft framework configuration model configurationmodel namespace mvc 6 is in the new microsoft asp net aspnet mvc namespace and is integrated fully so web api controllers are the same as mvc controllers so far in my own project i have found i needed to make minor changes in all of my html helper htmlhelper extensions now there is a new thing called tag helpers that are much cleaner to use than html helpers htmlhelpers for most things for example this html helper htmlhelper type razor syntax  i think this is the biggest and best transition in the history of asp net i am really liking the new framework we will even be able to use it on mac and linux there is even a new code editor visual studio code that can work on mac or linux as well and you can run the app from the command line etc exciting times i think best regards joe

thanks for looking into it it looks like it s not quite a simple as i first thought the issue arose within a rails project don t ask why we re wanting to access d bus dbus from there so there s autoloading magic making the matter a bit confusing the issue appears to be if active support activesupport is loaded around dbus with the class attribute patch being loaded before dbus and callbacks being loaded after dbus as in the following example  it feels a little contrived but i guess that s autoloading in practice

yeah historically it s a mess i don t know what s the best way to fix it if it was me i d 1 check the sendmail env var 2 check for msmtp in path 3 check for sendmail in path 4 check for msmtp in known locations usr bin usr sbin usr local bin usr local sbin 5 check for sendmail in known locations the reason i d prefer to look for msmtp first is that if someone has msmtp installed he s more likely to use it for outgoing mail but then again there can easily be multi user servers which have both installed and users might prefer to use one over another checking the env var would allow them to fairly easily set what they want to use hence the top priority but this may be far from ideal

thanks for the help it go gets now at least the sample code didn t work initially but after some minor fiddling it builds i m trying to learn go and thought an irc bot would be good to play with so i don t entirely know what i m doing yet

i m just using the web interface clicking the contact in the global address book and dragging into the private address book this moves it to the private one removing it from the public one i m not using any additional plugin like a customized version of additional addressbook i know from former testing that copy contacts between addressbooks is possible the carddav plugin allows this therefore i assumed that it s just a matter of the plugin code config thanks for giving me some idea i still have not checked what will happen if the global address book is readonly and the user tries to drag a contact into his own private address book

repo is private so i can t share but i m not doing anything out of the ordinary it s a gem that requires colorize as a runtime dependency and simply binding pry foo red at application entry point will cause the bug the bug appeared at one point without update to gem and changing version does not help  when i have time later i ll try to get to the root cause and report back for now will remove dependency

beberlei sorry for long answer my patches are in my fork https github com validname xhprof commit ede b c d f b b e f 678 0ede447b38c9d8f842b90426b225768e7248f678 and https github com validname xhprof commit c d fdb e bdf ceac ae 64 c50540d7337fdb3e7bdf015679701ceac350ae64 they both are concerned with php extension performance that was primary goal to improve it but i m not an experienced developer and hadn t dealt with cross platform code compiling so my patches will probably work only with my couple of linux glibc and kernel but we are using patched xh prof xhprof extension in our company now and have no problem except overhead about 810 of average cpu usage with 50 of total cpu usage that gives about 20 of overhead but original extension works with 2025 of overhead

are you referring to the bpfilter parameter in prads conf in our security onion distro we have a single central bpf conf that multiple processes read snort suricata daemonlogger bro the use case is that the user just has one place to modify the bpf for their sensor and they don t have to go digging through a bunch of individual config files snort suricata daemonlogger and bro all support reading a bpf from an external bpf conf some examples snort f etc nsm rules bpf conf daemonlogger f etc nsm rules bpf conf it would be a nice enhancement for prads to be able to do likewise prads b etc nsm rules bpf conf thanks for your consideration

so i experimented a little bit this post will have two small sections one answering your question and one summarising what i found section a i am not certain about how matpower does it i know what it says in the manual and what it should be doing according to theory but i have not gone through the code line by line here is what should be happening i will be very explicit just in case someone does not know electrical power system stuff the voltage get points of the generator should control the voltage amplitude at the bus the generator is connected at this quantity could be given either in volts or per units the matpower manual says that they are using per units which makes much more sense in other words the optimum vector of voltage amplitudes produced by the opf should be used to fill in the voltage set points of the generators specifically the bus id to which the generator is connected should have the same voltage amplitude as the generator setpoint section b i found a way to not have the pf solver iterate i do not know if it is the proper solution but it seems to be closer right now it is very late where i am and i do not have the time but tomorrow i will edit this post and include a minimal ingredients solution this is the first time i am using a platform like this i do not know what i am saying is good etiquette to give a small peak i addressed the voltage stepping issue just to be sure and made sure that the voltage angles and power generation va in bus and pg qg in gen are in degrees and mvw m var mvar respectively some of the three steps might be redundant i will check tomorrow

i apologize i didn t realize that i could configure two maven executions of the same plugin with different config my aim is to generate both java and c source from my thrift idl i updated my pom to run the plugin twice like so  looking at the code the thrift class assumes that the generated source is placed in gen java can i suggest that the output directory outputdirectory be made configurable and passed to the thrift compiler 
that snippet was taken from an after plugin that i created which i called perl omni as is suggested in the docs to do an extension i used neobundle to install the plugin directing it to this github site i was able to modify the vim file file you created in your plugin and that took but i didn t want to add my changes directly to plugin 
thks for your answer i did bundle install again restarted fork and rails server and somehow it is working now 
i use version 058 the latest installed with on the command line cpan www you tube youtube download

hmm that s unfortunate i set up a vm and installed centos 7 with perl 5163 and python 279 i wanted a clean environment to try and reproduce this the gcc version is 482 i received the same core dump with the sample program in it i thought maybe there was some odd library that i had installed into python that might have been the culprit but this was a near vanilla install one note i had to modify the makefile of python to include f pic fpic or inline python would not accept it and i installed to usr local prefix any ideas on a good way to troubleshoot this 
maybe setting back to us ascii would be a better solution then rather than using new string encoding stuff in 19 i did a quick sed on the source files to insert the encoding comment the only issue i had was with the ebcdic encoding in the test suite i checked our protocol and everything s in ascii which i m guessing is probably the most common use case 
beginner i have installed ssl crypto sslcrypto and i used the file named install as my reference for packages honestly my friend refernced the library in order to utilize the freedisk setup i just learned about the many more features that comes with the package and i have to give some credit great stuff life changing capabilities for sure i was wondering if we needed to change line 1675 in lib py freenet pyfreenet fcp freenetfs py does it have to do with the use of import fuse  end

thanks i did the change and it now works i would like to point out that the project readme txt file was a bit confusing in this regard and i should have checked the code instead would it be ok the update the readme txt file to correct this misunderstanding and include a small usage example

i think glibtoolize should be first as it will afaik always refer to the right thing even on hypothetical systems where glibtoolize libtoolize 
hi i also run chuck this way tmux or screen window but was thinking it would be useful to have some kind of utils or libs incl lick in an external folder this way i can refer to some of them from any working directory so i don t have to copy duplicate those files nor have everything i m working on at the same place or even navigate directories it just seemed more natural to me to do imports this way but indeed i can do the opposite and run chuck from that lib utils folder then manage paths within my ck files 
it s work thx 
in rails the getters are used too so far we ve only stumbled across level and formatter being used but there s no reason progname or sev threshold couldn t be used either it s not clear to me what sev threshold is all about for the getters seems like the most correct answer might be returning whatever ruby s logger does by default i played around a bit in irb  it doesn t seem like there s a great solution but that s the best i m coming up with 
oops my bad seems to work fine from git looking forward to the next release roger

i am not sure if we should call it a bug it s just a different implementation of the feature the issue is that without the plugin i am able to highlight the text by mouse copy and than paste by middle button it in many different places i am not able to do the same with the plugin activated to reproduce this issue please try to do the same mouse cope paste with and without the plugin and you would see what i mean yes i am pasting the same text over multiple places in gedit s editor i used to do it and need to do it quite often 
elpaso will try and thanks for looking into this you can reproduce it if you replace in your url items html with items if i add the html part it works for me also

yes i have activated the options do not solve the type for unrestricted geometries geometry and use the estimated metadata table i think the solution mentioned in 19639 would be a nice solution tables and views should only be read if the schema is selected but only the name of the table or view when the table or view is selected the additional information must be read

alexbruy when setting an input as optional and then running processing tools if no input is set the processing tools throw back errors the execution of the model will then be cancelled e g if you run refactor fields and its input layer is optional with no input layer set you will get an error and the execution of the entire model will be cancelled 
in that sense the rd 3rd proposal is better there is no magic and a click on the button is required but clear enough for running an algorithm twice

yeah but if sync all just pulled down some new grains then the grains should be reloaded i bring it up because this happened to me and i had to run state highstate twice any time i messed with a custom grain i imagine this is the case for any of the extensions that don t get reloaded during module refresh in my case it was custom grains so either module refresh should expand its role or load dynamic should call an additional function that also reloads the extensions not caught by module refresh

damon atkins i don t know a heck of a lot about windows it just seemed that use of delayed start was solving a problem that i think others might have and by looking at the types of services that used delayed start it seemed to be that it would be the most appropriate choice to use if instead it makes more sense to not use delayed start and set up dependencies then i accept that if it s true at any rate could you advise twangboy on what you think the most appropriate choices are for the salt minion standard start with no dependencies or whatever the presente dependencies are doesn t seem right to me and that s my overall point 
i don t think this is the issue i can start salt minion it works just fine but it won t run as a service on the server that s all i ll check that as well you never know

i do have a user group definition in my core state but i did not have problems with it previous to 097 i ve run these states before on my army of jails and they ve been working i can provide you with a copy of the sls files that minion includes if you think that d help 
the state itself is nothing special really 
i haven t been able to test that out since there are no ubuntu packages for 201472 yet perhaps i can add the module and state to the file server for the time being

no that should have failed i just did an code aptitude install ffmpeg code 
i can see advantages on both sides i think modules should override the builtin modules but maybe this could be a etc salt minion configuration option i think using system modules states etc over custom ones should be the default but we should have a way to do that it would make developing extensions to existing system modules much easier 
sorry i mean the syndic could subscribe to pre determined pattern on which a high level master publishes too for data only pertaining to the segment 
oops failed to mention running yum install y nscd works flawlessly so it isn t an issue with the rpm i would think 
yes this happens with master and minion on head
yes my files srv pillar top sls 
frome the following salt vm foo vm01foo bar sys doc ssh set auth key
that s the whole pillar there s nothing in the master logs when generated 
as mentioned in irc this needs to work in a way where the state can say these files notify this state as well as this state is notified by these files kind of like a requisite but one that doesn t modify ordering otherwise you may have a large number of sls files that could change and the state referencing files in them would be invalid by being able to specify this file notifies this state you could even wrap the state in an if that ensures the state exists formulas for instance 
it does thanks 
whoops i mentioned this idea in the channel and sounded like it was novel i didn t bother to look at existing issues 
sorry should have included that line in the bug report since i used it i basically copypasted from the tutorial no it does not work and there was no obvious way to do it and no non obvious way with template hacks either that s why i created this patch it does not work because during the first run the state compiles down to

here is the file abridged  unfortunately i currently cannot reproduce this problem no matter what i do the user is created before the ssh auth state is invoked even without the require statement presumably due to non deterministic dict sorting in python i don t know how to influence that 
i tested on the latest develop branch it does not exhibit this problem it seems to be fixed 
i tripped over this again today on salt 0174 having service enable true breaks things this is the state that i experience problems with today  the service is provided by ubuntu upstart only when removing the enable altogether will it say that the status was changed and that the service is started 
archlinux with salt 0105 according to the state output it doesn t even try to restart the service rather it just confirms that the service is running and moves on 
the actual one 0111
sorry it was because of the different versions it went from how i would like it to work to how it works and the different versions made me think it was going the other direction and then i noticed a contradiction and ya 
will test
given that i m happy to close it i ve got a patch for it in the debian packaging which i ll update for completeness but if it doesn t do anything might as well leave it 
it was discussed here https groups google com d topic salt users ce jo bm jo0bm hw discussion i m trying to deploy out many different projects via salt without having to grant ssh access on the minion to the upstream git repo the collisions in tag names is really the only problem

unfortunately in this version of salt it can not be resolved i had sent the patch that fixed this bug https github com saltstack salt pull 3698 you should change only the one thing with this patch instead of use the use setuptools it will be better determine this method as main and set distutils as optional like you did it in actual version with setuptools 
yes i mean the i m ok with the fact that some commands might cause an error on the minion i just expect the encoding to be right 
no minion installed on the destination host that s the idea of salt ssh isn t it

well it s been fixed since i deleted the keys but i haven t seen this issue since then i ll report back if it does happen again as i mentioned i don t really know what event would have triggered this except for mayyyyybe running out of memory since i haven t fixed the memory leak in our server application yet i expect that situation will come up again p
i can test on 0160 sometime next week 
my bad pip does not treat version postfix as version if you try the command below it should get you beta 3 110beta3
basepi good catch i found a couple of redundant requires in our state tree as a result too so thanks i ve updated the original report with a more correct sls the vm i m testing on started out with git v 17104 v17104 installed running this sls on that results in the error and no change to the git version removing git first resulted in an error and git v rc 3 v184rc3 installed i ran a couple of tests both with the initial install of v 17 v17 present success on salt 0164

salt 201417 with chocolatey 09827
yes it would report cleanly a second time if there s no issue 
yes this is the one that did it https github com saltstack salt commit eeda ffc ea fa fb ec aa d f 9 eeda1698ffc3ea02233fa574fb140ec0aa8d34f9
put the file on the system at the end of the state run after the grains have been set and then ideally i d like to restart a service after that i used to do this with a bunch of watch s but i d like to use listen listen in for better ordering 
yes that would be my favorite option i wasn t sure where to begin so i didn t try to implement specifically i need a config option for pillars not states but it seems they both only target sls files 
whoops here you go 
jgartrel can you confirm you followed the above instructions for certificate generation 
terminalmage ish log server is a key in the pillar dictionary that was missing essentially i had pillar log server  in the jinja template 
the documentation states which doesn t include any information on what the function does when timeout occurs i propose that it states if the timeout is reached it breaks and raises an error like you wrote above 
techhat thanks for the tip https github com saltstack salt pull 7137 will still work with my pull request for fixing this issue since the master still needs to have the key of the alternate minion id to talk to the master 
salt version  there is nothing
i ran it without any trouble and it seems to work thanks for the heads up 
master is 013 
are you asking me to restart the master or the minion i ve already tried restarting the minion without any change there are several other new minions in the past 18 hours which are able to connect to the master 
i apologize i thought i was using 0150 but that s my staging environment that is using that this was on 0132 and this feature was likely not introduced until a later version closing bug x 
fair enough cheers for info 
this make sense to me and it would be very python like on wed may 15 2013 at 553 pm thomas s hatch notifications github comwrote 
i putting my schedule config in the minion config it s work version 0160
techhat i see your point hmmm pip understands comments in requirements txt if so it might be worth adding a comment directing humans to read the packaging page for more information 
sorry forgot to mention master was running 2016113 before after downgrading back to that version we can cloud create again 
i tried with root salt minion service and salt call both using root and i got the same error
yes this is merely a feature request in fact also the documentation mentions nested grains and doesn t give clear examples on how to manipulate these thatch 45 thatch45 yes this would be to use with g 
basepi i am using 0153 on both minion and master what version is this issue fixed in 
thank you basepi this bug is always exist from 016 017 and the current develop 
unfortunately i won t be able to do that on my masterless windows minions without a 2012112 windows install executable i don t have the resources to extract directly from github repo will the windows installation page have the 2012112 version available soon 
i mean there are two ways to run a command the first one via zero mq zeromq means that we must have installed minion with accepted key on the master the second via salt ssh means that we don t need to install a minion we can just use ssh keys but there are many use cases to use salt ssh on hosts with minion installed for example for ease minion upgrades restarts etc in this case before calling salt ssh we already have an accepted minion s key on the master would be awesome that salt ssh will use this accepted key without generation the new one for ssh connection the point is i m not sure whether these keys are compatible or not 
same for the master and a minion 
jfindlay the docs for vmware are showing 201554 might be good to update that as well i m fine with keeping the legacy stuff in but we should try to duplicate the getting started content i think 
works for me i think there s still a chance people will miss it but overall this is an improvement i m going to close this 
cachedout the master s cache directory has k 44k files and k 36k directories basepi i tried a subset of minions and it started working i was indeed using those settings i modified them even further and added additional delays now it looks like this what has changed really is that the number of minions is growing since there s enough free memory available in your opinion more core will help it is not pegging for 3 hours anymore at startup but i suspect it will start happening as the numbers grow further 
version 201411 on master and minion on 13191 the custom grains aren t available until the minion is restarted so it does not appear to be the same bug i see grains available after i sync them but they disappear when i try to deploy a sls file 
cachedout i have 28000 directories and 37000 files 
i m using git develop branch head as of report time sorry with first reports i added specific rev but with bunch i filed that piece got dropped it was a f b a f b be eaf e 661 0a31f3b38a3474f56523b99199be91eaf721e661
hi basepi yes it works all my minions are alive after the week end i think the keepalive mecanism of salt minion zmq is not working well on windows i can do more tests if needed 
i just copied the mine functions inside the minion config and still get nothing back same behavior 
shadowfax chc i ve been trying to reproduce this in my salt sandbox environment to find out if it only happens with multiple remotes but right now i can t reproduce the problem according to the debug log the fileserver backends get updated every s 60s which i think is the default for loop interval then in the salt sandbox environment i have no minions running right now so i am not sure it is a function of load 
should fix it completely for any instances where salt generates the dest file not sure about modules cp get template forcing makedirs false that feels like it should be a parm passed by the caller but i guess thats more of a policy thing 
what basepi said in my initial set up scripts wasn t under salt but parallel to it despite the fact that the master had no idea of the scripts directories existence both the master and the minion went through all the motions even creating tmp files on the minion and returning a positive result to the master 
 verify env true  set the number of hours to keep old job information in the job cache keep jobs 24  set the default timeout for the salt command and api the default is 5  seconds timeout 5 i haven t made any changes regarding house keeping but as for 24 is seems to keep 24 days 
version 0164 epel 6
not sure if this is relevant the whole state highstate is done in salty vagrant using vagrant provision or vagrant up 
yes it now works successfully 
 the problem with cp list states it lists all states not only those assigned to the specific minion  the problem with cp list master it lists just every file provided by the fileserver but then again it would probably make the most sense to add a param like assigned true to cp list states which returns only those states actually assigned to this minion

carlpett right now all runners which execute on the master have the salt dunder available to them and this dunder is populated with the other runners so that functions from one runner can be cross called by another so if you need that functionality rght now it s already there for you the idea here is simply to do some housekeeping by renaming that dunder to runner and then bring in execution modules as salt

thanks that solves part of the issue i have tried the latest tagged version v 0171 v0171 and its summary is what i was thinking of v 0164 v0164 doesn t have the summary and v 0170 v0170 had very unhelpful errors about list and get some questions 1 do all lines tagged as error result in a failed state or does that still need to be checked 2 is it intended that the exit code will reflect if there have been failures for anyone that is curious the summary i get from v 0171 v0171 is 
none of the scheduled functions run i added both of them so i could see there is not somthing specific to the highstate and so i could debug faster on thu feb 20 2014 at 740 pm colton myers notifications github comwrote

hello waynew my feature request is to add merging capabilities to pillars and anything queryable by salt modules config get the same way the pillar specific pillar stack does https docs saltstack com en latest ref pillar all salt pillar stack html merging strategies when writing formulas the author can choose the merging strategy of the salt modules config get https docs saltstack com en latest ref modules all salt modules config html salt modules config get calls but then the user must override some formula files to choose something else i want to be able to define fine grained merging strategies for my config pillars grains  directly in the data not in the code using the merge parameter of salt modules config get for the context in the formulas community we are looking for minimizing the use of pillars https github com saltstack formulas template formula pull 186 since it can be quite costly on the master this is a common complain against the formulas which abuse of pillars this formula proposal use salt slsutil merge to merge the values from different yaml files and it support a per yaml merging strategy with the file top level key strategy to configure salt slsutil merge for example  with more fine grained merging policies i think it s better to implement this in salt utils dictupdate to make it useful to salt slsutil merge too and we could use it in our proposal https github com saltstack formulas template formula pull 186 regards

basically using my example above the dev top sls and the test top sls file change the to role webserver in each and set match grain basically what happens is that i get a collision it tells me that all states have to be globally unique and my minions that have that have the webserver role grain have their environment set to test and dev respectively in their config files 
i don t unfortunately my scrollback doesn t go back far enough anymore if you install 083 of requests and use salt cloud you ll see the errors right away what i do remember is that around like 345 of ec py ec2py with respect to response text text is not an attribute of response object 
i ll push out some patches today that resolve the issues i have with state cloud present and absent other statefullness items like what host folder resource pool the instance is in is out of scope no thanks no time 
as far as i can tell yes the change was incredibly trivial i did notice when looking in the code there is at least one undocumented argument passed to those calls maintenance db or something to that effect i thought about documenting it but after noticing it hadn t been documented anywhere i thought it might have been excluded for a reason and i decided to just leave it as is for now on mon feb 10 2014 at 113 pm colton myers notifications github comwrote   zzzirk zzzirk gmail com

i know but currently the dict is tenant name id  name  so to resolve a tenant id you need something ugly like this  my current code already checks if the returned dict is a one key dict and unwraps it we could add the typical this will change in release so people have some time to update their code and some comments log debug or info stating thes lines are for backwards compatibility with lithium and beryllium i guess 
had to leave just after posting this issue but now got a similiar setup here on my laptop and with a quick s load import and correct json b c it wants s instead of s and lorengordon s suggestion works  awesome this will make managing my pillar so much nicer i ll make a quick pr for the docs in a minute

looks like i installed salt minion before i added the official saltstack repositories and then installed salt minion from the saltstack repos you should maybe depend on versions on python deps so this doesnt happen 
hello cachedout this will be hard to reproduce i bet i installed salt master trough salt bootstrap git develop is there any more information i can give 
201472 but problem already spotted will open a pr in a minute
here s the profile i m using for the clone 
we use this version 201583 beryllium 
thank you for your reply i see a third party library could solve this what do you the salt expert advice to new comers imagine your product supports red hat redhat su se suse and ubuntu each in two versions do you keep six lists of packages to install 
mostafahussein implementing this via pillar looks good i don t understand why you want to get the user who executed a state at least in my environment it will always be root i would like to know the source of this file or snippet file blockreplace 
rhel 5 rhel5 salt version 201410 and as far as i know this is the most recent version available in epel http dl fedoraproject org pub epel x repoview 5x8664repoview salt html
nope but windows 2008 has unicode r in the name can this cause the issue 
sorry should have updated this i ended up just installing the salt minion via cloud init to whatever version it can find then i use salt to install the ppa and upgrade it as the first step solves my problem 
version is 201415
i have indeed one of the formulas i was toying around with is updating a bind zone file i believe the root of the problem could be somewhere in the salt mine though because i have another formula that used to generate etc hosts based on minion s network ip addrs which apparently isn t working anymore either the bind test formula this was running on the minion i reported the problem for  right now this is all running in my lab setup and when i checked today all 21 minions were unresponsive and there were four salt minion processes running on each of them interestingly the error message they are logging in var log salt minion is the same they would be logging when their key hasn t been accepted yet i e salt master has cached etc so i m not sure if the two problems are related or if i ve ran into another bug will have to debug that further 
that s it thank you so much 
the log is from salt minion l debug while it s being debug it turned out to be not so much detailed thanks for your hard work 
just pressing ctrl c in the terminal 
ch ll ch3ll sure that seem to fix it  another issue related hereto is the changing of the osrelease string we could fix it more or less easily interestingly it changed from 114 sp to 114
sorry for the delay looks like we can call powershell with non interactive noninteractive to keep it from expecting input seems as though that s also what puppet does https github com puppetlabs puppetlabs powershell commit a cc bec dfd bcf d a2789412cc972529079bec54466dfd0bcf82080d to solve the same problem 
because i don t want to have to place a script as root somewhere so that salt cloud can access it i did see that you can specify a full path for the script but if i d simply like some 23 commands run in order not necessarily same order or commands on 20 profiles i d have to manage another 20 files instead of 1 file with the 20 profiles i also find it to be more obvious what instance will do once bootstrapped by just looking at the profile if it was anything more complex and across several profiles i d agree a separate bootstrap script would be more useful and have used that previously 
hi techhat i m using the following 
same problem after upgrading 
hi cachedout i can certainly provide a pr but i currently only have a 201417 on windows servers and don t yet have anything setup to run the project tests i just worked around the issue by dropping in a modified file py file which works fine for me in states and from the salt master command line if this is okay i ll clone and submit a pr against 20147 branch 
2014110 original message 
it will be my first time but i will give it a shot this weekend when i actually have free time i would also like to add the info about using saltutil refresh pillar and restarting a minion if it s a minion config 
i don t want to talk to multiple minions just the local one i just want to run states re initializing the loader and renderer in between that way i can have a state that does something then run another state that can render via jinja or whatever objects set by the prior state 
no it doesn t as you note in the first state the newer one i m only passing tar options strip 1 and it s making a tar command that reads tar x strip 1 f when it should be tar x strip 1 f 
hello jfindlay i m using the last version from the repository 
it was probably pulling 2 from my browser history i still have machines on rc something 20152rcsomething fwiw thanks for doing the forwarding rule fixed 
i confirm this issue is still present in the 201550 version 
yes git latest does clone into the correct directory once i escaped the identity 
yes the state file works fine it do everything i want to do some sle file content in https www refheap com 95364
i just do something like this i also put salt master in debug mode but no info report when i execute salt key command 
sure 
cachedout it s not a master it s a minion the server is a lb for an rtb dsp system 
garethgreenaway upgraded from 2016116 restarting salt services doesn t help i ve reverted back to 2016116 and it works again 
then reference the vim new value and vim test value in a state file or template i don t know how to reference the parameters which was partly my question so i m not sure how to write that part 
the one in the current el 6 el6 repository 
here is the full log http pastebin com zr af jxw 0 zrafjxw0 the relevant part should start at line 2172
hi it depends on what i m doing if the command is something like salt test ping then it goes away after a few pings and comes back randomly if the command is the one above it persists with the same set of clients timing out if the command is something like salt i some pillar true state highstate test true gradually they all converge even tough sometimes this takes over 10 triggers of the same command 
how can i distinguish salt master processes 
dmitry kuzmenko dmitrykuzmenko unfortunately yours patch is not working 
whiteinge the difference is that there are no concurrent requests interestingly i switched the salt master to raet transport and was able to successfully login and use the token on a linux system or cygwin curl on a windows gives me an authentication error 
jfindlay archived file sounds like a great solution but i believe not currently available with windows minions 12992
hi guys i ve sent a pull request sorry if i ve done it horribly wrong it s my first interaction with github

thank you rallytime i simplified like this with same behaviour 
here you go 
we are not doing a pillar refresh from within a state all of the examples above are directly from the cli i took the following steps 1 no changes made to p illar pillar data 1 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar item python 2 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar get python both commands retrieve the same data 2 update the pillar data 1 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar item python 2 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct updated data the pillar get retrieves the old data 3 refresh the pillar data 1 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 saltutil refresh pillar 2 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar item python 3 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct updated data the pillar get retrieves the old data 4 restart the salt master 1 service salt master restart 2 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar item python 3 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct updated data the pillar get retrieves the old data 5 restart the salt minion 1 service salt minion restart 2 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar item python 3 salt saltmaster 1 saltmaster1 pillar get python the pillar item gets the correct updated data the pillar get retrieves the correct updated data so it appears that only by restarting the minion does this correct the data what are the circumstances under which pillar get will have different information from pillar item using pillar get in states is desirable for something like  otherwise you end up needing to validate that the pillar exists as you think it does layer by layer 
with redhat lsb core rpm installed  the logic is to try and find those values in etc lsb release if it exists and then try etc centos release if it doesn t with redhat lsb core rpm installed etc lsb release exists but doesn t contain the necessary information it can only be gathered from etc centos release

thanks i ll try that out is there an example that i can look at for an implementation of utils execution module 
sure 
i discovered the root of the problem the library zip salt fileserver directory does not have in it all the files that are in the analogous python lib python27lib site packages salt fileserver directory when salt unity py is run directly does anyone know how those files could be made to be populated in the library zip based directory 
jfindlay i don t even have that file in there and on whole fs and what s interesting when you set locales multiple times with jinja cycle actually would be nice to have names already supported it gives error only once with first locale that strange before that it s been giving around 3 errors regarding some locales not sure what s changed 
maybe twangboy can have a look i have no problem submitting a pr if he also thinks this is the correct solution 
i wrote that all versions should be affected the maintenance process doesn t have anything to do with commands being invoked afaik 
rallytime thanks for the advice the script args git v 201580 v201580 configurable resulted in a bunch of errors and a broken salt minion installation so instead what i decided to do was create an etc apt sources list d saltstack list file on my template which points to repo saltstack com which seemed to help at least 20158 was installed via apt i also used master type standard in my salt cloud profile config and it created etc salt minion with that line in it only now salt minion won t start b c it doesn t like that either is there a way to prevent master type from being included in etc salt minion entirely i think that would at least enable me to provision a bunch of servers with 20158 and get salt minion running successfully fwiw my salt master is running 20158 and is where i m running salt cloud from 
this is not just for test ping i tested it using cmd run as well or are you saying that i should not be running the commands from master of master if i were to run with b option it runs fine but adding b would only applies to minions that are directly connected 
upgrading it today will provide more info as you requested then 
jfindlay  what is the best way to determine the backend from what i can tell i have not installed any of those and salt is using git directly when i review the module s code usr lib python dist python27dist packages salt modules git py on the filesystem i only see the cmd module used to run git directly and the module s virtual does a which git 
tbaker 57 tbaker57 unfortunately it does not 
oddly enough i can t reproduce the issue i ll close the issue for now and re open if i find out what caused it to happen in the first place 
made a virtualenv pip install e i re created the virtualenv from scratch just now and wiped all pyc and pycache files just to be sure 
hi apologies for the late response the salt version for the master is salt 201471 and the minion is salt 201471 we installed salt via yum and we are running oracle linux 6 on both minion and master thanks 
fresh ubuntu 1404 install with a root password set and no other modifications salt ssh fails no matter what command i try as stated at the end of the above comment other means of connecting via ssh w pasword work fine i can do it from command line with ssh and i ve got a node pty js script that spawns a command line process which also works fine 
same happened to official ubuntu build same version 201472
jfindlay 72 version of the test results are correct but with list target execution error like this
rallytime i will try s undt ch s0undt3ch s patch this morning and let give you feedback 
no it returns just fine
yum x or exclude yum is a python application and it is replaced in fedora 22 to dnf i don t know them in that depth as you gentoo on 141015 0818 elias probst wrote 
rallytime absolutely and i ll do ya one better below is the output from our versions report but we also found fixed the salt winrepo issue and submitted a pull request https github com saltstack salt winrepo pull 214 it turns out the issue was just some yaml syntax mistake in a winrepo entry nothing specific to our salt setup as always really appreciate the quick responses 
sorry for being slow to respond jfindlay all systems were installed with salt bootstrap however since it currently doesn t install 20158 i had to use pip to upgrade salt from 20155 to 20158 after the bootstrap systems that had already been configured under 20155 i e already ran the highstate before upgrading to 20158 didn t show the issue systems that applied their first highstate on 20158 did show the problem rallytime pretty sure that is a separate issue the error is different 
rallytime this issue did not occur on the previous installed rpm salt minion 2014751 it appeared when upgrading from 2014751 to 2015501 the strange thing is neither npm nor nodejs are installed on the rhel 5 rhel5 boxes and i can t find any of my states related with these packages but it turns out i have few rhel 5 rhel5 boxes on which the issue does not occur i tried to disable rules specific to the ill nodes without success i m not sure about how to reproduce the problem on the healthy production nodes any hint on what could trigger the call the npm version 
rallytime i ve upgraded the salt master and salt minion to salt minion 201550 lithium this issue still occurs 
201581 on all machines master syndic and minion 
cedwards the output above was from the minion while in debug mode here s versions report for master 
subsequent runs that happen via this configured schedule seem to work fine etc salt minion d schedule conf  the custom returner has some log info messages it always sends that are missing from the output on the initial run and no data appears until subsequent runs so i m pretty sure it isn t being called at all 
techhat done i hope i didn t mess up anything it s been my first pull request ever 
salt version salt master 201550 lithium it is jinja code into config file i want to run the same config file with different parameters for different group nodes 
cachedout sorry maybe this will provide more info when i ran my saltstate stated above this is the error i get  it doesn t seem to accept from port at all although not sure why 
forgot the obvius info 
arroyoc will update the salt versions to that and get back with the results soon 
there is this error in the master log but not explicitly tied to gitfs locking although suspicious enough  unfortunately i don t have an in depth knowledge of how the master handles simultaneous pillar compilation for more minions but my best guess is that some stray checkout doesn t adhere to the lock you mentioned i ll do my best to look into git pillar implementation in the next few days and see if we can easily mimick the behavior of gitfs for state files that is having a separate directory for each dynamic environment thanks for any help until then 
jfindlay there s nothing in the minion log because the schedule is configured in the master config i ve changed the log level to trace but as you mentioned that didn t help much here is the only line that i get regarding the scheduled job 
installed from repo saltstack com i completely purged salt from my system even moved var salt cache but that didn t fix the problem any suggestions on how to further debug this issue could it be related to the python installation itself or a configuration option will try to reproduce this in a container 
this issue does not occur on redhat 7 with python 27
virt what doesn t exist on free bsd freebsd but i ve basically debugged the problem down to a dozen or more cmd run calls the code calls cmd run intead of subprocess call but i cannot see what is happening inside cmd run since the log level is lost and nothing is logged inside there 
cachedout the document looks good and currently waiting for 25908 in order to validate the same 
mgriffin 13 mgriffin13 thanks for the reply unfortunately the suggestion you made is not working the state gets re applied still furthermore by setting 1020 will create a cron entry like 17   script and not like 17   script 
per a comment i made on 35874 could we get this fix backported to 201611 and likely 20163 also there s another issue that i ll open separately if you have multiple interfaces on v 3 v3 they ll keep overwriting themselves the pr mentioned here fixes the region aspect but there s still a problem w the interface i ll look into the keystone py and see if it s readily apparent why interface is being overridden by each subsequent call and submit a pr i should know later today tomorrow if it s going to be a simple fix or not if not unless someone else with my knowledge of this module wants to take a swing at it i ll await the oxygen release and see if that fixes it and in the interim utilize the cmd run unless combination i m using currently 
i think when not in batch mode that it returns 1 i will need to reproduce for certain

the issue pertains to the output not the actual error reported the output of state sls should be state output not a data report 
reactor config is pretty simple etc salt master

i ve set the the masters extension modules setting to srv modules put the python file into srv modules pillar and configured the ext pillar setting i ve tried to reproduce this on a different server today but couldn t reproduce it either 
it seems that winrepo dir is not a required setting and defaults srv salt win repo if i change file roots base to srv salt formulas it silently breaks winrepo functionality imo it would follow rulle of least astonishment to have winrepo default to a location that is relative to file roots base and of course require an absolute path if you point it to some other location if you place it outside of a file roots path it should generate some warning in this same winrepo functionality i ran across another issue that i will create a separate issue for mentioning it here as it is related it seems there is no way to turn off the default repo locations for winrepo remotes as well i m find that if i don t set a remote i get the saltstack salt winrepo git i believe this requires me to rename my fork of the repo and still leaves me vulnerable to issues with the public repo i ll open another issue for this and of course all of this applies to ng variants as well 
jfindlay see below
we are calling it from a external module furthermore it is happening on multiple versions of the windows os although if you look at the the code associated with the call stack it will obviously occur on any version of windows
jfindlay thanks for the prompt triage output as follows 
jfindlay thanks for checking in here s the info 
what do you mean by this the code excerpts above are from my master file below is pretty much the entire master configuration with a bit of redaction 
jfindlay 201581 both master and minion 
here s a pr 39925
python requests version 123 salt cloud l debug list sizes my azure config 
i want a failure in highstate on any minion to execute some reactor on exacty one master node exactly one only once i m not sure if this is achievable via compound matcher modification only i doubt it so to achieve this the following needs to be achievable in the reactor run  execute some shell script doable target only master nodes to make sure that we only run it from known set of nodes doable limit the execution to only 1 this is for me unknown for now as the compound matcher will try to run the reactor on all of the master nodes in parallel the goal is to actually run it in a sequence  try to run on first master if it succeeds stop if master unreachable or command retval 0 continue to the next minion from compound matcher
sorry forgot to mention that 
thanks jfindlay salt version salt 201583 beryllium few details master ip etc are masked but it will not change anything  provider config
if i m on the client via command line i get usr local if i do from the salt master salt hostname cmd run brew prefix i get nothing 
i tried adding the double quotes as suggested and that doesn t seem to make any difference hopefully the output you wanted below thank you etc mtab 
i was upgrade both master and minion now all ok 
regarding the the cpu mem running salt now pings the processors and memory will go from 600 megs to around gb 174gb when running this statement see the picture included this is while running the state listed above selection https 003https user images githubusercontent com ae fa fc 512387931176677ae5fa9fc a e e a b d f f ed a8e111e782a9b1d265f0f1ed jpg additional information this server is only running the salt master it is not being used for anything else 
i m not sure how to get relevant debug output salt minion master l debug gives too much but this issue looks same as this one https github com saltstack salt issues 16709 and same patch fixes issue for me no warnings output order looks right 
it could be an acceptable workaround to achieve the end result that i would like to see but i still believe the initial issue remains
jfindlay oops forgot the version info here it is 
thanks for making that clearer 
ch ll ch3ll the template i am using doesn t have salt installed until it is deployed by salt cloud the key is created on the master just before the vm clone starts i e just before this line on the salt master info creating test 3 test3 from template templ  which is also before the deploy script which installs salt is run 
ssgward here is the produce
the rpm plugin for artifactory appears to be closed source i m not sure how they are doing it by providers i just meant the plugin systems for spm pkgdbs and pkgfiles what i m wanting is for spm update repo to call artifactory which does whatever it wants to return something that spm can consume in other words spm metadata in download repo metadata is just an endpoint and could be replaced with a custom endpoint if needed  clarified is the format of spm metadata specific to the sqlite implementation or is it just a yaml file that contains the latest formula file content from each package could i return json from artifactory instead and have spm parse that the latter would be nice as then in theory anyone could use the open source on premise version of artifactory plugins are only available in the paid versions 
garethgreenaway the internal behavior of salt here was exactly right but we re running in a context where the unix exit status matters given that the failure was expected and handled i m asking for a way where in this scenario the failure of a single state doesn t translate to the failure of the entire salt run one solution would be for salt to return a different exit status if the only states that failed are all onfail in states 
the minions are windows based so i m not sure exactly what user is running them i ve used the windows installer fr salt 201585 i m guessing it s running as some system service with admin rights i can successfully aquire grains from them when authorized using e g salt winminion grains items this warning appears in the salt master even if i don t have any minion keys accepted meaning no connected minions so i was under the impression that it was the salt maser which had issues running dmidecode it s also on the salt master i get dev mem no such file or directory when running dmidecode manually the salt master is being run by root on the host running docker 
oh sorry haven t seen that one will give it a try later today 
hi ch ll ch3ll i want that the minion polls the master for example every 20 minutes to execute a specific state i ve added this configuration in the master config file schedule job 1 job1 function state sls args  update 2 update2 env nacl minutes 20 but this don t execute anything the sentence that i put in the server to execute the state is salt machine 7 machine7 state sls update 2 update2 saltenv nacl what am i doing wrong thanks 
jfindlay we do have a scheduled state highstate that looks like this schedule highstate function state highstate minutes 15 maxrunning 1 a couple suspicious things to note so far i am running a failover master setup and most of the minions only have 1 connection open to port 4505 at time for the minions with this issue they have two connections open to different masters on 4505 this is true for the other issue created as well https github com saltstack salt issues url 31159url if i restart the salt minion i go back to 1 connection to port 4505 and a state highstate will run again all of my minions have this issue but i believe that is covered in https github com saltstack salt issues https 30472https github com saltstack salt issues 30472 20160212 200013662 salt utils schedule info 628 running scheduled job master alive 20160212 200013844 salt utils schedule error 30899 unhandled exception running status master traceback most recent call last file usr lib python site python27site packages salt utils schedule py line 703 in handle func ret retcode  self functions pack context retcode key error keyerror retcode 20160212 200213661 salt utils schedule info 628 running scheduled job master alive 20160212 200213851 salt utils schedule error 32141 unhandled exception running status master traceback most recent call last file usr lib python site python27site packages salt utils schedule py line 703 in handle func ret retcode  self functions pack context retcode key error keyerror retcode 
version is 201585 beryllium need any additional information 
gtmanfred we certainly can but it looks like the current develop branch s docker stuff is very broken it s going to take a bit longer than expected the new docker image present state and dockermod pull pass along a client timeout keyword argument to the docker client dockerclient function the thing is the corresponding docker client dockerclient function does not accept the client timeout option and a exception is thrown once i ve traced down the commit that added it i ll reference this and send along a pull request that patches it up  update i believe i ve found the issue and let the relevant committers know in a comment in 36872
201581 beryllium 
jfindlay here you are  i also just found that someone mentioned https groups google com d msg salt users phu m s nz lae phum1snzlae v d tu ws cg aj dtu5wscgaj something similar on the google group but i didn t see any issues in this repo that looked related 
jfindlay yes i do have a top file in all branches and it is exactly the same everywhere in fact the rendered top file in logs is the right one the question is why my minion does not even try the targetting described in dev environment 
sorry for taking so long to get back 201587 work has been hectic anyway is there a reason the foreman pillar doesn t use the same file that foreman node utilizes rather than accessing the api current method it would be possible to call https foreman salt node minion id format yml which presents all the same information as foreman node retrieves i m not familiar enough with ruby or foreman code base to fix foreman node but i did create a couple replacement python scripts for master tops and ext pillar to get everything running the same way using the above url they won t upload grains but it provides a workaround in case foreman node breaks if you want me to submit a merge request for that i can otherwise the merge request i made a couple days would close this issue 
running salt pillar get key does return the correct secret as i would expect which leads me to believe that the boto elb execution module does not render the pillar in the same way that the pillar execution module does i can t provide an example of the pillar without sending my password however creating any valid credential to aws should be able to reproduce this issue for example in your pillar if you had a keyid gktadjgheiqsxmkkrbj h gktadjgheiqsxmkkrbj08h and key askdjghsdfjkgh wup ujasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs askdjghsdfjkghwupujasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs this would work 
here we go gtmanfred salt master  so it really seems to be an issue with dmidecode rather than salt as such but maybe we can improve the parser in a way that it either ignores such kind of error messages or maybe if applicable just returns the first line of the value what do you think about this approach

setting cachedir to relative path var cache salt master doesn t work in 2015882 and leads to the same exception setting cachedir to absolute path users user salt var cache salt master does work though why this isn t a regression this comment in master config file says it should respect root dir 
twangboy thanks for clarifying i presumed the permissions weren t getting set as any user could read the log files and cache content 
it is likely update specific and order specific  i ve installing the two net updates using win wua get and then applied the uptodate state and didn t get the same problem i ve applied the uptodate state twice in a row and didn t get the problem on the second try so there seems to be a logic problem in the way installation results are processed pre  salt salt test test versions salt test salt version salt 201920 dependency versions cffi 1115 cherrypy 1741 dateutil 275 docker py not installed gitdb 205 gitpython not installed ioflo not installed jinja 2 jinja2 210 libgit 2 libgit2 not installed libnacl 161 m crypto m2crypto not installed mako 107 msgpack pure not installed msgpack python 056 mysql python not installed pycparser 219 pycrypto 261 pycryptodome not installed pygit 2 pygit2 not installed python 2715 v ca a ea 3 v2715ca079a3ea3 apr 30 2018 163026 msc v 1500 64 bit amd 64 amd64 python gnupg 043 py yaml pyyaml 313 py zmq pyzmq 1712 raet not installed smmap 205 timelib 024 tornado 453 zmq 425 system versions dist locale cp 1252 cp1252 machine amd 64 amd64 release 2019 system windows version 2019 10017763 multiprocessor free pre 
it happens about once or twice a day on each of our salt masters the git pull is one of the salt master s own states so this is for the highstate of the master itself but following a suggestion i found elsewhere online i deleted all the pyc files under usr lib python site python27site packages salt first stopping the salt minion and salt master services with the theory that there were stale pyc files left around from before the upgrade i did this yesterday afternoon and have not seen a recurrence of the error i ll keep an eye on it over the next few days 
i assume you mean file  edit i installed the module from os installed it s in dist 
is there an open bug we can track 
ch ll ch3ll this would explain why it s not working on my installation since the version from the repo currently is 201588 thanks for the clarification 1
i checked out gdd fdc 201630589gdd10fdc from git and ran it on saltmaster both as server and client i still end up with an empty result i can t seem to find any debug logs relating to template rendering running commands with salt l debug gives lots of details about network communication but nothing at all about what actually goes on internally my master configuration does not contain anything particularly exotic  and see what results you get 
ch ll ch3ll thanks for looking into it please find the requested info below 1 salt master is ubuntu 14044 lts salt ssh is running from here 2 target systems are rhel 67 rhel67 cent os 67 centos67 3 installed the following salt packages in salt master salt master ds 2015810ds 1 salt ssh ds 2015810ds 1 i have also tried using salt master salt ssh on cent os centos 6 but getting the same issue do we need any specific package on the target system in my case the target systems will be mostly rhel 567 cent os centos 567 
currently we are not setting the update head option the default of true is in line with the expected behavior which is for the code in the git repository to be updated to the specified rev from what the docs say it seems that setting it to false does fetch only instead of fetch and checkout which is the default 
windows 7 64
the minion is installed on windows so i use the available installer on saltstack website it s a bit annoying for debugging stuffs on windows but so far configs are pushed correctly from the master only minion cli seems to cause issues one cannot run any command i use windows 7 pro sp 1 sp1 64 tell me if you need more info
no it does not help at all there is clearly something broken in the db refresh command
ch ll ch3ll yes there is no implementation for install as far as i see the code this must be a documentation error the win certutil py docstring also needs to be corrected 
i found the root cause is that i deployed these v ms vms on google cloud and i specify a startup script which will run everytime when the vm was restarted and in that startup script it will restart salt minion thus causing salt minion start twice ch ll ch3ll thanks anyway for your time on this 1
thanks ch ll ch3ll so the challenge i have is trying to figure out how to upgrade my master and minion to a later version of salt after pretty much an entire afternoon of attempting to do this i ve basically managed to nuke my salt master and can t go backwards or forwards at this point so yay so i guess maybe if someone else can verify this is working in a later version then we can close this ticket off if it s expected not to work in 201553 and i ll muddle through trying to recover my master back to something that works again 
hi sorry for the delay the issue is not happening on windows r 2 2012r2 i am seeing the issue on windows 2003 both 32 bit and 64 bit hope this helps 
i think this is the package you are refering to 
ch ll ch3ll thanks for your answer did you try it with the cloud init file etc network interfaces d cloud 50cloud init cfg it only happens to me when that file is present even if that file is not sourced in etc network interfaces
oops pasted the wrong command i did run salt call c etc salt local config get sock dir as well and even salt call c etc salt local config get sock dir too without the those gave the result as in the original message with the trailing minion the output actaully included warning config etc salt minion directory does not exist 
just retried it no it returns  there are 88 states applied to this system at once when i run state apply and i m not sure what can interfere here how can i debug that 
yes it seems like a duplicate i m happy to close the issue 
ch ll ch3ll it seems to be broken as far back as v 201832 v201832 the version we are currently running but i haven t tested anything before that my suspicion is that this has never worked correctly 
sorry didn t explain terribly well on a systemd server it appears etc sysconfig network is no longer used for setting hostname therefore i propose that the state module check for the presence of systemd then update the hostname via hostnamectl rather than continue to modify the etc sysconfig network file which no longer provides that functionality 
hello thanks for looking at it by the code of grains core py salt fetches that piece of information from etc lsb release in my case that file is missing the required info  so the question is who is responsible for maintaining etc lsb release  interestingly no deb package is responsible for that in my installation dlocate s etc lsb release  nothing  apt file etc lsb release gives package debian edu config doesn t look right either so i m not really sure that fetching information from etc lsb release is a realiable way on debian using the command usr bin lsb release would be reliable but that command is not always available on debian servers depends on optional package lsb release etc os release would be a much better candidate as it is maintained by package base files and contains all the information you need please note the situation is different for ubuntu systems in ubuntu etc lsb release is indeed maintained by package base files so it should be always correct hope it helps 
ch ll ch3ll gave a shot that piece of code resolves the issue on my end need to see how to write tests for it

hey sorry for the long absence we had to switch from open ldap openldap to free ipa freeipa but the issue still persists i m sending requests for generating keys for minions i m using a batch script together with salt bootstrap to install salt minion on servers part of the installation process is to generate keys using salt api so we have a group for approved administrators that should be able to generate keys but this doesn t work with salt api for some reason here s what i know so far sudo curl s sk ssk https saltmaster keys 8000keys d mid testminion 1 testminion1 d username user d password pass d eauth pam returns  also not sure if it s relevant but when i call sudo curl s sk ssk https saltmaster keys 8000keys d username user d password pass d eauth pam to get a list of current minions it return the same html as above but if i login sudo curl s sk ssk https saltmaster login 8000login d username user d password pass d eauth pam and then use that token to list minions it works however this method doesn t work if i try to create a key 
thank you for looking into this  30604 is the latest i found where jacksontj explains this feature was added to avoid loops  have a reactor that runs on every event you will infinitely recurse  we could look into some other mechanism to not fire events from the reactor i have to respectfully disagree with the presumed necessity to block firing events from the reactor what i refer to as first level events in my comment to my argument for loops are not banned from languages just because they can become infinite under poor coding techniques by adding a simple check into the reaction sls i can easily avoid recursivity e g  a web hook triggers a reaction that fires runner state orchestrate directly from its sls another reactor is set to watch for salt run ret events and its reaction launches a different type of runner not runner state orchestrate  this code is commented out in salt utils reactor py  skip all events fired by ourselves if data data get user  self wrap event user continue  the system keeps on executing events and reactions indefinitely till the service is killed confirms the recursivity problem when the above safety code is removed however if i put this into salt run ret event s reaction to bypass any processing unless the event was fired for runner state orchestrate if data fun runner state orchestrate  the process exits gracefully after processing the final condition for the runner state orchestrate event i m interested in back to the feature request if i can control whether or not the reaction fired event is put back into the reactor s loop i can carefully build reactions to interrogate all events i m interested in or exit otherwise 
gtmanfred do you have any idea why this could be failing i ve used the nova driver settings that are required but i still can t authenticate is there a guide or correct document i should be looking at update using identity url http server ip serverip v 20 5000v20 auth version 2 worked for me perhaps keystone api v 3 is not supported yet 
hi gtmanfred an upgrade on my minion solved this issue salt call 2014113 hydrogen to salt call 2016115 carbon my full state is here if you want to take a look http paste debian net 952528 thanks best regards rmy
starting at line 822 in the win service py there is the def create about 200 lines under that at line 1011 is the code i am speaking of it tests if the service already exists if it does it returns an exception it in the salt modules folder
ch ll ch3ll yes it s fixed in 201634 thank you
i used to dynamically load the icinga server adress in my states files with  set server addrs salt mine get services icinga network ip addrs tgt type grain items  first  used this since 2017 but somehow when i made the last highstate the above command failed stating that the list was empty so i tried to make this work on the command line and failed at it 
complete sls file is it comes from saltstack formulas collectd formula
seems to work thank you

is user data more cloud provider specific in the spinning windows minion documentation it say that to open ports 445 and 5986 we can use user data for passing script which will get executed and open the ports but if the ports itself is not open then how will salt communicate with target so i wanted to know how exactly user data would work there are more parameter called script and file map what is difference between these 3

our company has almost no linux so we only have tested the deployment for windows and haven t setup tested the bootstrap for linux so unfortunately i haven t tested if this is only windows or also is a problem in linux but i believe this will be specific to the salt cloud vmware provider

just to be sure i m going to rebuild my test environment and retry each of these question tests will have an update for later in the day

i ve just started the vagrant machines this time it looks even worse the processes seem to be started only once 
hi gtmanfred no i didn t setting that option to true or false makes no difference 
hi garethgreenaway its all on the same host i think the following is the offending code https github com saltstack salt blob cb cfcc cc c e b dde eedd d cb6cfcc5945cc66c9e675b2777dde8591eedd20d salt client ssh init py l l 410 l408l410 i m guessing if i target an ip address and ptr points to hostname that points to a different ip i would connect to that second ip that is frankly a terrible behavior

this is blocked until 201832 is actually released 
in my experience using the file server to ship modules to override the built in ones is not consistent especially when saltenvs are mixed in 
yes i want my ec 2 ec2 instance to terminate on shutdown so then i can schedule shutdown on my instances at a particular time and they will terminate automatically aws gives an option to set it while launching a new ec 2 ec2 so i was wondering if i can do it while launching an ec 2 ec2 from saltstack

i ve basically followed this tutorial to get things up and running https docs saltstack com en latest topics tutorials cloud controller html cloud controller the only differences here are that i m using a custom kvm qcow 2 qcow2 image located on the hypervisor filesystem which uses our internal yum repos and already has the salt minion installed in the image also i m not using the capabilities of virt keys as per tutorial but i m using certs on the kvm services signed by our internal ca instead this all works as the virt query function is working as expected 
maybe my system was slow but if changed close fds to true in cmdmod py it returns in 4 seconds which is much faster comparing to 13 seconds i tried changing the value of maxfiles in the kernel parameter and the result was the same

honestly i ve never tried doing that creating a pull request and making integration unit tests check me on this to see if i ve got it right 1 create fork of the development tree or 20183 on github 2 make changes in the fork 3 make a pull request from the fork to the source repository second item is the easiest part for me right now 
i don t know i ve found some old issue that seems to be fixed 31210 because 38996 and 33669 was linked to this one
it is running under the local administrator account 
my server doesn t use git for certain reasons i could do manual few file diff fix but the link provides fix for 2017 not 201830 so i guess i have to wait for the release of 201831 into repositories https repo saltstack com ubuntu thanks though good to know it s already fixed in upcoming upgrade

hi gtmanfred unfortunately that doesn t work the output is  thanks hanna
as far as i know no manual activity caused this this looks like the beginning there don t seem to be any earlier messages  sorry i could ve added that right at the start hope this helps 
hi thanks very much for the details i am still working to isolate the issue further imho it would indeed help to have the refresh pillar synchronously available it s a bit challenging due to the amount of available saltenv high amount of calls and number of minions we have here to find the relevant logs one piece i still don t get is e g which component is finally really processing rendering the pillar is it the master and the minion and both ideally compute the eventually same data is it the minion which than sends the pillar to the master for further reuse is it the master using data from the minion i am asking this to get a better catch on what to look for we are only at the beginning of our analysis at the moment basically the issue is that from time to time we see that minions either lack pillar information at the same time we also see that the minion synchronizes environments it should not know about at all that may be a different issue or not most of the time everything works as expected sometimes not i know i am very unspecific at the moment sorry for that 
hi i am not sure i understand the question i am talking about this feature https docs saltstack com en latest ref states requisites html retrying states to my understanding the retry feature is implemented in the code calling the state functions but not directly within the state functions that s visible in those log lines  also it obviously does a retry but the retry in this case is only related to the checksum verification but not the download this makes the feature pointless somehow

dwoz sure 
this is for salt modules nxos py not salt proxy fx py fx2py what i am saying is the patch for the fx py fx2py resolved the issue with the salt cisco nx os bug that i opened this issue about 
same problem as i can see this code was not touched for 2 years and was not working from start i can provide small pr with fix

not just an n but usershow instead of user show also just makes things a little cleaner but that is just cosmetics because for example showuser usershow show user and user show all mean the same thing 
it turns out we were mistaken something else is overwhelming the master closing this issue as invalid 
sorry my bad i put the wrong cobbler url on conf file 
yes i have custom grains which is what am trying to sync across the fleet though we have 8 syndic masters which manage all the minions and all syndics masters are connected with multi master fyi i have running sync command from multi master

i m afraid this is not the only package affected i searched the saltstack ubuntu repository for more duplicates and found the following conflicts only precise trusty xenial bionic latest paths md sum md5sum os packagename  on reverse dependend packages which themselves probably must also increase in version then but it would be nice if someone with more debian packaging knowledge could verify this 
dwoz not sure if this answers your question or not but i definitely have to use a different set of keys for each zone but those settings are defined in the profile file for the instances individually and not configured in the provider file where i consider those values to be global parameter values that are defined across any profile i use when i indicate the value for the provider attribute in

hi here is the state 
it kept printing every few seconds i had a backup of my old config and and diff showed only one difference which was max threads commenting it out and restart fixed it the only special point in my config is external pillars 
with the default cache system we can only retrieve mine data for minions attached to the same master my need is to retrieve mine data attached to other syndics that why i use a minion data cache nevertheless i can reproduce the issue with etcd cache on a single master deployment and only with etcd cache i have no issue with default cache system 
garethgreenaway in this case these are proxy minions
