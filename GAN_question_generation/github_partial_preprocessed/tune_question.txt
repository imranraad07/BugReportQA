shouldn t you have to write do bar testing opt   seems like an argument mode checking error 
would this approach concatenating all doc comments be ok 
can you give some more information please this builds and runs just fine for me i m on linux using both 13 stable and the nightly from 917
wouldve been fixed ish by https github com rust lang rust pull 29848
could you also put those last two sections in code formatting to help us read it more easily 
could you gist the commands you re using to reproduce also what target are you using for this 
could you write it in llvm bitcode instead i think we re hoping to use as little assembly as possible in order to make supporting different processor types easy 
how are you testing this when i try it the compiler just straight up rejects the program 
what commit version are you using 
would they remain uncapitalized if so they would be a very big exception to our naming conventions 
does it really make sense to pass option int to a generic math function making use of add mul 
can you provide a testcase showing that occurring it should not do so 
can we support just enough to do this in the most palatable way possible 
do you mean if if is some returns true option mutate returns true if else does it return false 
does use self extra json work imports are relative to the top of the crate not the current mod 
would you review my pr 
would a crater run be sufficient to evaluate the impact 
can you try f f fe e f a c a e cdc 653 3038f30f96fe366e910f9a02521c5a06e5cdc653 the commit before alexcrichton s larger rollup 
where does the macro definition above introduce a token interpolated 
should we add this to perf seems like maybe yes
can you point out examples where this is happening just curious which instances you re referring to 
would using changing transaction scan to pub fn scan a mut self https play rust lang org version nightly mode debug edition gist 2018gist dbf ebb c ce e ba e b c c f 2dbf8ebb9c30ce5e81ba2e1b6c50c42f work for you 
do you know where it gets included from i have libunwind installed as a dependency of perf but i haven t run into this 
should this be in rust lang rfcs 
do you have a test that shows the behavior you re describing 
what is the signature of bytes vec mut 
what s the error that you re seeing when running the test 
what are the differences between android and linux gdb 
what system are you running on and can you provide the exact invocations of rustc i m unable to reproduce this on osx and linux so far 
could you provide some code that reproduces the ice 
what happens if you remove mod protobuf 
can you expand on this 
what happens if you do a make clean and rebuild 
maybe something travis specific can you try to upgrade to the latest 1360 and see if it still happens 
why not have rust resurrected as a separate project 
what s the output you get with rust log rustc metadata loader 
don t we already get an expression id in trans intrinsic ref id iirc 
should only one be printed 
what about define to parallel c 
maybe a dup of https github com rust lang rust issues 19035 seems similar 
why not split unused variables and unused parameters 
do you know of a way to minimize to something other than rust postgres 
does that resolve the ambiguity here 
which target is this for there are multiple calling conventions across operating systems and architectures after all 
can you paste the output of rustc emit ir foo rs 
can you describe how you compiled this code and how you compiled the compiler 
could you try running make distclean in the repo this is normally indicative of an outdated crate 
could you provide a contained example to test this out on this block https github com rust lang rust blob master src librustc driver driver rs l l 249 l242l249 looks suspiciously out of date but i m not sure if uncommenting it would actually work 
does it render correctly if not it may be a bug in the mardown parser 
would you mind gisting an entire transcript of the make configure logs 
couldn t you split it 
could you point me at the documentation which says that this should be allowed 
how would this work the backing storage for arc t and rc t is two usize s bigger than that of box t or would this not be a free conversion 
what does this have to do with env var it doesn t seem to be mentioned in that output 
do you have a link to the code that causes this we re working on making a auto reducer and we re curious what happens to this 
can you report this bug at bugs llvm org 
can you provide the exact rustc invocation you were using i m unable to reproduce this locally 
what version of rustc did you execute this with i think this should have been fixed by 11525
what happens if you remove the rust undefined behavior namely writing to null 
maybe we should do some messaging to alert people optimally rustc could simply deny compilation if the abi doesn t match 
could you give a few cases where you think this might be useful 
what needs to be done to fix this 
what do you think arielb 1 arielb1 i imagine this will cause more backwards incompatibility on the various corner cases that ast borrow check gets wrong is one concern 
do you have an example of a code snippet to reproduce this ice 
did you come up with any good workaround for this issue 
can this be closed 
would you mind giving it another try 
how would that interact with rustc test and cargo test 
can you give me an example 
what s the motivation 
could you clarify 
maybe i should rather attach this post to the error message 
can you provide a stack trace of the crash when using gcc 48
does building tensile also result in unresolved external symbols linker errors 
what happens if you do rustflags ccodegen units 1 cargo incremental 0 cargo bench cc alexcrichton
does rustdoc produce anything for this 
does that suffice for your use case 
can you reproduce this with a more recent rustc build nightly somehow it errors properly without an ice for me 
doesn t char is alphabetic https doc rust lang org beta std primitive char html method is alphabetic fulfill this need after cursory look at the code it seems to be doing exactly what you d want https github com rust lang rust blob a dd src 13a2dd9src librustc unicode char rs l l 552 l530l552
can you please paste the output of gcc version please note that if mingw is on the path it takes precedence over the packaged version 
could someone post a stack trace with debuginfo 
did you import the end of file endoffile variant 
do you remember how recently aiui i think this should ve been fixed by https github com rust lang rust pull 15597
can you still reproduce on a recent nigthly 
can you provide a smaller example and a more detailed description about how to reproduce 
which version of rustdoc are you using it works fine for me using 127 stable and newer image https user images githubusercontent com b b ed e b acfee e e b 718941842661299b2b21ed2862511e888b8acfee8e81e3b png 
can you provide the code that causes the ice as well 
what is the shared ownership guide i think this text is from the api docs of rc yes 
do you have a generated wayland c interfaces rs at hand if not i ll have a look tomorrow
why this should be moved into rustc 
how would they interact with os str osstr os string osstring from std 
why can t the parser unambiguously detect that denotes a range in that context 
what does rustc version output 
does it still ice 
what should it be equivalent to 
could you check the output of rustc v verbose the host part indicates whether it is win 32 win32 i 686 i686 or win 64 win64 x 8664 x8664
do you have an example of code that produces this crash 
could you please help with this problem thanks a lot 
does this issue have something to do with the performance problem described in 37939
did you ever investigate further 
maybe the travis machines were just getting unlucky 
could you include the implementations of the traits just so it s easy to reproduce test 
what to do with it 
do we get any benefits from this if we still support older llvm versions cc alexcrichton badboy
did you see this not as the behavior though 
can you provide more assistance in debugging as well for example what was at line 896 of lib rs what configuration did you provide etc 
do you have an example of code that behaves differently on windows than other targets 
what s the benefit of the proxy type over just using an fn trait object directly 
maybe a duplicate of 45689 
can you edit your first message and add triple backticks graves 
can you please clarify that this is a tracking issue you can take https github com rust lang rust issues 63569 as an example or anything else with the c tracking issue https github com rust lang rust labels c tracking issue label 
can you expand on why we should link to to string tostring from these pages we link to display which is necessary to implement format 
do you propose to remove that linker option may seem obvious but you didn t state that 
could you try again with today s nightly please i think you need rustc th 9th june
can you share the code please 
do these tests pass with a stage 1 stage1 compiler that doesn t include the llvm change ime stage 1 stage1 test suite almost never suceeds 
maybe double check to make sure you aren t specifying bin i just tried again and it works fine for me i am also on the latest nightly 
what n did you use also it would be convenient if you could paste the log of the compilation to make diagnosing the problem easier thanks 
how is this different from the never type https doc rust lang org nightly std primitive never html in fact that page mentions infallible errors https doc rust lang org nightly std primitive never html infallible errors with the same wording 
what are the contents of those files 
did you get any warnings foo err bar ought to know that foo is dead there 
why not fix that instead of regressing compile times of almost every crate ever written even the inline always on the from impls seems to much a normal inline should suffice 
could i make a const array that usize long 
how did you compile the rust code it looks like you passed emit obj but that isn t pulling in upstream dependencies so you may want to consider using crate type staticlib instead 
can you elaborate on this it does say the word prelude and links to the module documentation for it which covers it further 
would you be ok reopening the issue over there thanks 
which compiler version are you using 
does that make sense 
what s your rust version 
do the fix steps there work 
how about posting the code to see what causes the error 
how should this be fixed 
can you run du on the d sym dsym file if you get a chance 
did you set in your cargo toml 
does this reproduce on 120 or nightly if not could you provide us the source 
does rebuilding libcore via xargo or cargo z build std help 
maybe a lint which warns when this impl method https github com rust lang rust blob master src libcore clone rs l 54 l54 is invoked could help because i don t think this is ever intended when someone explicitly uses clone 
maybe a problem in llvm the rust side doesn t do anything architecture specific as far as i know 
can you be a bit more specific what exactly is the error you re getting 
can you provide the entirety of the code that you tried to compile 
could you provide some more information or some example code steps to reproduce this 
why should it error 
may i take this issue 
what this suggests to me is that there are no unit tests for e 0463 e0463 how should i proceed 
why isn t the same argument true for repeat isn t the size available via layout size 
where is that quote from exactly not in the top level readme md 
can this be a memory safety issue 
could you elaborate on the rationale for this do other compilers do this e g msvc or clang 
maybe as name would be better to just match the other tabs 
does that make sense 
does that solve what you re thinking of here 
does the section in the book answer these questions should we model it after that or just have it refer to the book 
does power pc powerpc do something different that means it matters more here 
how can one reproduce this 
do you have some more info is this something users experience or is it mostly custom drivers running into problems 
could you provide a snippet to reproduce the problem 
maybe related to https github com rust lang rust issues 51130 
does cargo clean fix it from the backtrace it seems like yet another instance of 33778 this issue is really hitting a lot of people 
how would you improve it it seems pretty clear for me 
why are you relying on unstable features for umm stable tooling pretty et al by now are only used for debugging purposes and wont be stabilised 
should this be closed in favor of https github com rust lang rust issues 43081
would it also be possible to move delim span delimspan inside delimited or would that not help 
can you provide a small example to reproduce the ice with the custom types you used it s difficult for us to bisect reproduce ourself 
do you use any unstable features might be existential type related
would you mind re filing at rust lang cargo 
does it happen for you outside of mingw 
should we audit libstd for other types that don t need to be there 
how does pthread once t deal with this issue we ve been thinking a bit about switching to the system primitives instead of rolling our own 
can you elaborate on why nonoverlapping is useful to you in volatile much of its advantage over regular copy is in optimizations many of which are turned off for volatile 
can you upload or post the file somewhere 
maybe you should rename your issue with x py check fails for everything except core and std 
what s the stderr output 
would that work 
could this possibly be a bug with futures or tokio 
might be 40593 a fix for that has been merged about a week ago can you try to reproduce on a current nightly 
could you give an example i m not sure i understand why there is expected to be a difference between a lambda and a function 
can you use strace to figure out which system call is failing 
do you mind 
can we see the rest of the code especially around line 46
could you show your config toml otherwise i don t think this is really actionable not sure what ignores stuff means either what do you expect to happen that didn t 
could you re file this against https github com rust lang rust www please thanks 
however a bit more explanations could be useful any idea quiet misdreavus quietmisdreavus 
does it happen after x py clean as well 
how many total threads are you spawning what kind of platform are you running on 
what s the exact issue on nightly this is expected not to work on stable beta
does running cmake from the console work 
could you check wether this ice is present in stable or beta 
should it lower to some architecture specific abort instruction sequence should we document what that sequence looks like or would eg an infinite loop also be a correct implementation 
what s the use of such an api that isn t covered by with capacity already 
maybe it would be possible to have a codegen test to make sure 
what results do you get with ccodegen units 1
can you post here the code that crashes the compiler 
couldn t rustfix interpret them that way 
which tool are you using to generate that code and where are you specifying the export include 
could you confirm that 
what os are you using this might be a case of https github com rust lang rust issues 49438
does that also happen on nightly do you have a small codeexample that does trigger that error 
can you attempt to obtain a backtrace or coredump 
could you provide the codebase which caused this error otherwise i think we ll have to close this as it s not actionable without a test case 
maybe it was just accepted because it was just a move 
can you verify wether you hit the same output on 127
why does clippy depend on rustfmt we only have it in our travis tests and even then a test fail shouldn t cause an unshipped tool
what if you have multible structs rc when to print which 
what s your rustc nightly version 
does the ropi rwpi relocation model work 
do you have a screenshot please also on a precise page would be useful it s very likely a css issue 
do you have a code sample which triggers this it might be fixed by https github com rust lang rust pull 55487
could you re file this against https github com rust lang nursery mdbook please thank you 
can you please re file this against https github com rust lang book thank you 
can you provide an example of this is this due to debuginfo included in the binary 
what file system are you using for the project directory 
can you provide an example or playground https play rust lang org that causes this error 
which version of git are you using the progress flag has been added recently and possibly your version of git doesn t support it 
how would the default impl work if the type doesn t implement partial eq partialeq 
would it be possible to get the sample file that is referenced in the error message use csave temps and ccodegen units 1
what is your filesystem for home is this local or remote location 
maybe we should take the old contents https web archive org web https 20180924035000https buildbot rust buildbot2rust lang org homu and throw it in a markdown file in the repo https github com rust lang homu and link to that 
can you post the output i cannot reproduce this in the playground for any release https play rust lang org version nightly mode debug edition gist 2018gist edac d e e aecc a 6 1280559edac71d09e31e3aecc32201a6
can you run this with strace to find out whether this is due to statx 
can you please rust backtrace full cargo doc and post the result here 
could you set the rust backtrace 1 environment variable so we can get the full backtrace 
why is there even an element to do spacing of all things 
can you run with emit llvm ir and provide the ll file 
can you provide the source code needed to reproduce this 
can you produce a backtrace for the crash i m assuming it happens somewhere in the panic implementation 
what distro and hardware are you building on can you post the output of uname a 
how did you try to use drop 
which version of python are you using 
could you provide the code that caused this ideally a minimal example would be best 
can you please explain what kind of bug you are talking about and how this might be incorrect 
can you try the code with a recent nightly and see if it reproduces 
wouldn t a refresh of the index right before the search solve this 
do you recreate it each time i ran it on a 3 node cluster and the last stats returns fine running on master which i believe you are as well 
what is the expected output of the search at the end of the script 
maybe its a race condition issue if you create the elastic searchable index first wait a bit and then index with percolation does that work well then 
maybe we can implement an expliciit lucene filter for double metaphone that generates both tokens 
can you give it a go maybe it also fixes the other issue 
can t you just use the weight attribute of a function instead of influence score influencescore 20 you do weight 02
may i ask what you are missing from the default one maybe we could just improve it 
what is the aim performance improvements immutability for the sake of a cleaner system or better security 
which version of es did you use when this problem occurred 
how do you execute the build maybe you have another gradle version installed based on this issue http issues gradle org browse gradle 324 we should get more output since gradle version 07
why it will be written to a field minimum should write and what is the default behaviour now 
did you see a case where you needed a different execution mode 
did logstash that you started had an elasticsearch version x 018x was it on the same box as elasticsearch 
why don t you wanna wrap it isn t that good enough 
does that resolve your issue if so can you please close the issue 
how about simply calling to string tostring on the object you get back it should work well for everything except binary ones base 64 base64 shenanigans 
can you confirm that what are you trying to do  build from sources  play with elasticsearch beta snapshot 0210beta1snapshot  just want to play with elasticsearch latest stable release 
which version of elasticsearch are you using did you change anything in elasticsearch configuration 
how much memory does the id cache take are you running low on jvm memory how much of the heap used 
could this be because of the stop word no 
when does it make sense to round up instead of down 
where did you get theses instructions 
wouldn t it be easier to build a terms query instead of a match if you already know which terms you would like to query 
would that be all that useful though i mean if this is a common idiom then yeah but it doesn t strike me as common 
can you provide a full gist that reproduces this problem 
do the queries vary that much a sample one would be a great start i wonder specifically if you list fields to be returned as part of the search request 
can it be made to say coming in 0906
can you retry and report back i just tested with a fresh ubuntu vm and it worked on that one 
can you make sure that both java applications are using the same version of the jvm even minor version and retry 
which version are you using 
can i see how many shards are per node for these indices can you provide your setting too like concurrent rebalance etc 
do you perform terms aggregations on your string fields if yes then this memory usage is due to global ordinals that elasticsearch builds on top of doc values 
can you expand a bit on what you did and what would help in your case 
could you please open it in https github com elasticsearch elasticsearch lang groovy project 
could you describe your use case 
do we need action level granularity or would it be enough in most cases to just be able to specify which cluster to use when there is ambiguity 
can you give a concrete example using documents and queries i think it will help understanding the need for the request perhaps offer an alternative 
does curl localhost stats 9200stats help here maybe 
does that help 
do you have a full stacktrace where the excception occurs 
can you give examples 
maybe it is worth adapting to make this api work with java api too 
does anyone who knows more want to take a look 
do you see it differently markwalkom 
did you install java without using yum rpm if so that is the problem if you do have java installed via rpm who produced the package what does the package provide 
why not using nodes info api you will have a cluster wide overview http www elasticsearch org guide en elasticsearch reference current cluster nodes info html cluster nodes info
could you give beta 1 200beta1 a go and let us know if it has addressed your needs 
which version of elasticsearch are you running 
what kind of errors are you getting from the reindex api 
can you share curl call instead of code samples this makes it easier to see what your doing i m unfamiliar with the api calls code that you re sharing 
why on earth would you want to add this complexity to elasticsearch honestly i d prefer to remove the source transform script altogether 
could you explain a bit more why you would like to have this pickypg 
can i work on this 
what version is this on 
do you know how deep these mappings went could we reasonably pick 100 as the limit for nesting 
which plugins and versions are you using 
did you install icu plugin version 220
maybe x content query builder xcontentquerybuilder or something along those lines 
would it work for you if we allowed to configure a maximum size 
may be we can close this one 
could you talk about your use case s 
what version of es is this this issue should already have been fixed can you try this on 131
why are you trying to use pagination with scroll 
can you elaborate a bit more 
can we close this one 
what does the query agg look like 
could you be more explicit about exactly what requests you are running on which nodes 
can you reproduce the issue are there any errors in the logs i m looking for something like concurrent modification exception concurrentmodificationexception but it may be something else 
can you give an example where it does not 
can we just make geo point geopoint immutable without adding another class 
could you check that again 
how big is your cluster node count index count shards and replicas total data size heap size es version what is your config 
why are you logging to a unc path anyway 
can you set the discovery logger to trace that we show use more about the individual pings that go out 
could it explain your issue 
how much heap space have you allocated to es 
could you open an issue in rss river project 
could you give details on what you exactly did and versions 
what version of es are you using and do the hot nodes have more primary shards than others also how many shards per node in total 
what kind of store do you use are you using index store type memory by any chance 
how many shards how many repl what is your index status of these 4 shards 
would you like to send a pr to update the docs 
what is the actual error you are getting also how did you install elasticsearch on your system 
does that get you what you re looking for 
maybe we could simply add the node uuid and the cluster uuid to the shard key cc polyfractal
would you mind trying again 
do you use the delete by query or bulk ap is apis are you aware of any issues you had with nodes falling over 
do you have any custom config your config elasticsearch yml file 
what happens in the new suggester areek 
what gives bin elasticsearch plugin list 
how many master eligible nodes do you have and what is the value of discovery zen minimum master nodes 
did you set minimum master nodes can you check the current master for all nodes during such an event by calling get cat master 
what are permissions of home user can you do something like where elasticsearch is the user name that you run elasticsearch under 
can you reproduce this problem and if so can you switch on debug logging so we can see what s going on 
what is your maven version 
can you take a look drewr 
did you add the path repo setting to all data and master nodes and did you restart these nodes after making the change 
can t we just do this by default 
can you try arc distance in miles arcdistanceinmiles instead in the script and see if results are as expected 
does it work when you replace query string with a match all query and or when you remove the range filter 
what is the reason that makes you want this feature 
do you mean this https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current docs index html timeout 
did you see that somewhere in docs you should do that on the client side may be using an alias would help you 
did you confirm this on 17
maybe we should simply fail or document the fact that scroll and rescore don t play well together 
how about using des path conf in the meanwhile 
can you add the full query here i cannot reproduce this 
which version of elasticsearch and which version of ubuntu 
what is the use case 
should we move forward on this it looks like a low hanging fruit that has the potential to make things significantly better for most users 
do you see any odd behavior due to those primaries 
can you share your elasticsearch yml file you can anonymize it 
can you print the result of get cat plugins v please 
did you mean to post this in https github com elastic kibana 
could you check whether you can reproduce the bug with a more recent version of elasticsearch 
can you reproduce consistently with the java api if so can you provide an example snippet in a gist or the like 
do you have a stack trace in the logs below the null pointer exception nullpointerexception 
what happens if you don t install your plugin are you using the official distribution or are you building your own elasticsearch version 
could you reduce your recreation to something simple and point out exactly what problem i should look for 
could you give us some examples 
why not changing the level to debug for org elasticsearch cluster metadata meta data delete index service metadatadeleteindexservice in your log j log4j file instead 
will this be sufficient just set it when you create the index 
would you be able to share a heap dump of the node upon oome or if that is too sensitive screenshots of a heap analysis tool showing the top consumers 
could you rerun your tests and ensure that the template exists in elasticsearch before you index any docs 
what does it give in elasticsearch 22 in term of response time did you try it 
could you confirm that please for the record we have a test which tries settings with 2 zones https github com elastic elasticsearch blob plugins 21plugins cloud gce src test java org elasticsearch discovery gce gce discovery settings tests gcediscoverysettingstests java l 72 l72
does that help please note though that elastic reserves git hub github for bug reports and feature requests but provides a discourse forum https discuss elastic co and irc channels https www elastic co community for general questions 
can you provide thread dumps of the nodes that are stuck what happens if you delete the snapshot that is stuck does that unblock the nodes 
maybe just the hot threads api though it might not work because of the breaker 
can you be more specific about what does not work 
do you mean symlinked that s probably your problem 
do you mean transaction logs or files in the logs directory 
why are you setting index version created 
can you please do an ls in usr share elasticsearch lib and past the output here it seems like the upgrade did not remove all previously installed files 
how many nodes do you have in this cluster 
do you have multiple nodes and you unmount the share only on some of them 
what version are you using 
can you clarify one thing it seems that you are using your own docker image and not the official docker image provided by elastic is that correct 
would you like to send a pr 
how big of an overhead would be for you to use a specific client instance for long running operations do you have an example of requests that would need that 
can you please specify the os version 
do you have an example log it would seem more appropriate to modify the haproxytcp to allow unix int unix socket id instead of the ip port haproxy patterns ref https github com elastic elasticsearch blob modules 52modules ingest common src main resources patterns haproxy l 39 l39
could you try to get a heap dump when the memory is full 
do you agree with this if so i would like to close this feature request as a duplicate of 20640
what would be the benefits of using a different encoding 
maybe we should update the docs to mention that both content types are supported or do we plan to only support ndjson in the future for bulk and msearch 
do you have any logs you can share from the node that dies due to oom 
do you have a lot of these search requests or just a few 
do you have a special custom version of java maybe pasting the output of usr java jdk bin jdk18073bin java version sheds some light
can you please provide the version of elasticsearch and the mappings 
would that work for you you could parse the string back into a number if you expect a number for a particular script 
maybe you have a lot of snapshots on the azure repository 
can you share a recreation of this issue 
can you please provide a sample of documents aggregation and output you d like that would help to understand your request thanks
would you like to work on a fix 
did you by chance also use a gui tool instead of curl before can you please retry with curl 
would you please reopen this issue on the kibana https github com elastic kibana repository 
however what error do you get when using the above it looks to me like the indentation is off path type etc should be indented one more level 
what have you configured the heap size to 
can you try 654 and tell if this still happens for you thanks a lot 
what would you expect in this case a percolate query is used to matched stored percolator queries and not meant to be used inside a percolator query 
what do you mean by that are you deleting the folder on disk as i suggested above or are you issuing a delete command on the index 
where are the steps to reliably reproduce this 
do you have anything here what happens if you send the request without get instead of head 
would that work for your use case i might me missing something though 
how are you going to use keep types token filter to exclude specific token types 
whats the actual failure here it would be helpful to include that in these ci reports since the logs get swept away over time 
maybe the keep filter https www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current analysis keep words tokenfilter html
can you explain that one 
can you please detail your reproduction 
do you have the full stack trace for the class cast exception classcastexception from your server logs 
do you want to submit a pull request otherwise ill push a fix for this on monday 
what should this endpoint handle 
would that work 
can you also share a copy of your elasticsearch configuration 
can you please attach that 
could you elaborate 
what is the use case for this beyond what monitoring already provides 
do you wanna open a pr for this 
can you share the full log file 
can i work on this 
would you mind configuring a shard size and retrying your tests i believe that will fix the issue you are seeing and make the results more deterministic 
do you mind taking a look i only pushed a doc change so probably not but i will take a look nevertheless

can you check if you have a maybe empty py qt 4 pyqt4 directory in your site packages removing that should fix it 
can you provide a copy pastable example 
could you try this in a more recent pandas it seems to work for me in 0202
can you provide an example 
do you see another table added somewhere 
would setting that to 0 be equivalent to bias true 
could you do the same thing for what you re currently seeing that would be equally beneficial cc tom augspurger tomaugspurger
could you also post the actual output that you re seeing and the output that you expect 
what version of pandas are you using some things were fixed only in 0202
what exactly are you trying to accomplish here 
would you be able to test that with the 0210 release candidate published a few days ago see https groups google com forum topic pydata kx vdd z hjv i kxvdd6zhjvi 
would it be possible to provide the visual that you re seeing now and if possible what you would expect cc tom augspurger tomaugspurger
can you show pd show versions how d you install pandas 
could you do some profiling to look where times differ 
could you provide a reproducible example by creating a small table in memory using python s sqlite library that will cause this error to surface 
do you have an example where this is incorrect 
do you have any interest in writing a pr to fix it 
could you give an example you re already allowed to add arbitrary attributes to a data frame dataframe so you could add a dict and put stuff in there 
can you run the code in https github com pandas dev pandas issues 19340 issuecomment 359416261 and check if that fails 
can you provide a sample excel file for this 
wouldn t df iloc 3 always achieve the same thing then 
could you provide us a reproducible code example 
why do you think it should and did this cause an issue for you it doesn t recognize none type nonetype as null either 
would this be in addition to or in place of the usual pandas metadata 
what is the expected result of your code samples 
did this behavior work in a previous version of pandas 
can you installing the master branch an re running your code 
what exactly resulting in a error what environment 
does anyone know what it s supposed to do beyond the one sentence description in the docstring 
can you try making a simple reproducible example that demonstrates the issue http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports we can t use pickle files for a unit test 
what do you mean by an implicit way  cc jreback
why would you need this you d be much better off just assigning those scalar values as individual columns this seems rather hacky
can you try constructing the series and dataframe outside the timed loop i doubt that is the issue but itd be good to rule out 
what s your expected output here you can t have non datetime 64 datetime64 values inside a datetime 64 datetime64 column 
can you clarify your confusion about isin that returns a boolean array of values that are or aren t in the passed values what s your expected output for isin 
can you try on master 
can you double check your pandas version 
can i work on this issue 
can you create a minimal sample to recreate the issue this is a rather large one so harder to reason about than it needs to be
could you please post a copy pasteable example your example is not reproducible http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports
can you provide a minimal code example to reproduce the issue there are way too many moving parts here to effectively isolate the issue
why not use use pathlib 
can you step through the traceback and check where things break it may be difficult for someone other than yourself to debug 
what makes you think this issue is with pandas and not spark 
can you try on master rc 1 0240rc1 and see if it s still an issue i get a different output from you 
can you post the full traceback 
how would you get this to work irrespective of pandas 
how d you install pandas 0240 hasn t been pushed anywhere yet 
what output are you hoping to see here still an empty data frame dataframe 
do you get this if you just use the label instead of df columns 0 on the left hand side of the expression 
can you double check your install and your script 
maybe we can just dispatch the complex formatting to the float array formatter floatarrayformatter pandas only somewhat supports numpy s complex dtypes which are all float based afaict 
does 27972 help on that front might need to be extended to cover this in particular
can you show the expected output you re masking a series with a boolean series so you should get back a series with the true rows 
do you mind simplifying your example to a minimal set of operations http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports
can you try running this code against master https github com pandas dev pandas commit bb c d e b c ee ddc ee d bb0376c209d97e49b9c94038926ee62ddc0ee84d  i tried it there and i don t see any noticeable leak 
can your bug report be simplified 
do you have any way of profiling 
can you profile the two using snakeviz and or line profiler 
can you create a minimal example http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports and fill out the issue template 
can you post pd show versions i think this raises on master
can you fill out the issue template with a minimal example http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports
can you provide a minimal example and delete the issue template stuff from your post http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports
can you provide self contained code samples to reproduce unfortunately screenshots are not very helpful
can you check the pr where this was implemented to see if this case was discussed 
can you not use charted or another library for this 
what does it fail with an import error importerror most likely needs an importorskip on html lib html5lib and or beautiful soup 
can you try on master looks ok for me 
can you try with a fresh environment rather than installing into an existing one conda create n pandas rc 0 100rc0 c conda forge label rc c conda forge pandas rc 0 100rc0
could you try it on master branch or rc 100rc pandas general py indicates this might be an old version
can you try this with master pandas rc 0 100rc0 i think this is fixed 
what version of pandas do you use eventually released version 0251 can t solve this bug but the current development version dev g b 31 110dev0419g625441b31 has solved this problem i hope it helps you 
does the original datetime string include year month and day information 
can you provide a reproducible example http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports
can you check that 
can you import just num py numpy can you try out an environment with just conda forge and just defaults packages rather than a mix 
can you post the full traceback and investigate where things are going wrong 
can you provide a minimal example http matthewrocklin com blog work minimal 20180228minimal bug reports

does this have something to do with pandoc if so how are you running pandoc what is the input etc

do you encounter the same issue with the edge version on github master 
what happens if you do active admin activeadmin register page as fancy page 
does it work outside of activeadmin 
did you find a work around i m experiencing the same behaviour using master 
did you ever figure this out 
can you show the register block that generated this stack trace 
what is there in your activeadmin tags resource file 2 did you try disabling that get tags before filter 
can you try the workaround described in 2225 and see if that works for you 
can you please explain a little bit more i m having the same issue what is the dependency fix 
what version of bundler are you using have you tried upgrading it 
which version are you using 
could you explain your situation 
did you ever figure a way around it if possible i d like to also have the same datepicker throughout 
can you put a stack trace of the error in a gist https gist github com 
can you create a pull request 
could you add it to the wiki section of active admin activeadmin 
did you still have an admin interface a fresh installation a problem following the documentation 
does this work for you 
what is the code you have tried using to load in the helpers provided by these gems might work 
could you elaborate 
what exactly is the typo 
what do you mean by adding comments what are you trying to accomplish 
when you say 060 do you mean the official gem release or the newer code on git hub github what version did you upgrade from 
could you give the specific line in lib active admin resource controller actions rb that causes this error what is it you re trying to accomplish what s the use case 
what do you mean the generator inserted the routes in the wrong place 
what version of rails and aa are you running 3 are you able to successfully register other models in your app 
how do you deploy it does it work on local machine in production mode 
maybe that s the problem 
do you have aa installed in the admin namespace 
do you want a filter that is only visible for admin users or do you want the dropdown to only contain admin users 
what version of aa and rails are you using and what does your active admin css scss file look like is this happening both in development and production 
can you provide the stack trace what version of active admin are you using 
can you give more context for example what version of aa are you using and what browser version are you using do different browsers also do this 
can you confirm that you development log shows a query with the given scope but not the filter 
can you post your gemfile lock 
can you provide an example 
where in devise is timedout being used i searched through the codebase and couldn t find any reference to it 
which version of active admin activeadmin do you use 
do you see a admin user adminuser on http admin localhost com admin 3000admin admin users as which admin user adminuser are you logged in as a admin true or false 
when does that happen if you add a filter or if you use a filter can you post you filter setup 
what do you suggest i don t think adding a migration helps because migrations are only run once when you install aa right 
do you have a different user model for the backend 
do you have updated from 06 remove this folder from your app app views active admin 
what kind of class is the related resource 
does your app starts in the developer mode have you tried to start your app in the production env local 
can you post a screenshot with a arrow where do you want that button 
did you have installed and setup devise please post you routes rb and user model
can you provide the stack trace for this error 
why du you list the variants tow times 
did the same happen if you don t overwrite scoped collection 
which inherited resources do you use 
can you take a look at the spec https github com activeadmin activeadmin blob master spec unit pretty format spec rb and let us know if we are missing something steps to reproduce would be great 
can you let me know where to look for fixing the issue thanks 
can you post your gemfile maybe one of your dependencies uses coffe script but was relying on activeadmin to provide the dependency 
whats the admin user adminuser model look like how do you configure devise are you using a friendly url gem 
what s rake routes returning 
can you provide specifics around the actual metrics data size and queries you re running 
did this happen after upgrading to activeadmin 250
could you inform us which ruby and rails version you re using 
what s best practices for these numbers 
when you have downlaoded your version of pyro cms pyrocms 
which version are you using 
when does this happen an error by itself makes it hard to reproduce 
could you elaborate on this a bit 
what are the specific actions you are taking the url is fine 
can you in any way provide the string that was passed to the parser and made this error pop up 
what is your cms version 
can anyone of the core team comment on this please maybe that would solve remedy better the issue a lot of people have with the files module 
can you give us any more info i m unable to replicate this issue
what part of the example you posted is incorrect if the robot visits site com blog sitemap xml it then generates the sitemap for that module 
maybe you can get them to enable it if not you can always wait until a pyro cms pyrocms maintainer actually deals with this 
maybe you have disabled in the settings the bottom options in admin settings http pic webas lt c bt t qxq b cbtt3qxq7b png good luck
what sort of interfact do you see this having similar to the navigation items with a multi select auto complete box 
what process are you using to create this duplicate user

how does craft store their layout information serialized 
what back end software do you use 
can you pull develop and try again 
what version are you referring to on this one page chunks was removed in 2 i believe 
maybe just a cache issue couldn t track it down as it disappeared 
could something outside the rails environments like ha proxy haproxy be stripping away the parameters 
did you see any problem in production log 
why don t you just rewrite the up to be inert and print a warning 
can you post a failing application on github i will look into it asap 
maybe this is due to local cache https github com rails rails blob c ed a a cab d c a a ca e activesupport 83c1ed9a1a11196cab66d9c44a56a902ca0710e4activesupport lib active support cache mem cache store rb l 31 l31 used for repeatable read s

can you provide some examples of where this might be useful one i can think of is project project action project 
would you interested in providing a pull request for this feature 
does the issue also expose itself in a single project build i am assuming you are talking about this code https github com nebula plugins gradle extra configurations plugin blob master src main groovy nebula plugin extraconfigurations provided base plugin providedbaseplugin groovy l 165 l165 not working 
could you please provide a reproducible sample instead of just saying create any test classes which fail 
could you confirm 
can you confirm what os and gradle version you re using please an example would be helpful here if you have one 
should i create a separate ticket 
can you try this with gradle rc 33rc https 1https gradle org release candidate i had a very similar issue and it was fixed for me by the 933 fix 
would you be interested in contributing it 
could you please open a separate issue for it including a reproducible example 
can you comment on the request 
could you please provide a sample and detailed steps 
what is your use case for using a provider file collection filecollection 
would you be interested in providing a pull request to fix the issue 
could you submit a build scan https gradle com scans get started for your scenario 
does this duplicate https github com gradle gradle issues 10708 
why do you depend on maven local mavenlocal gradle uses its own cache 
why do you want to add something manually you can define everything you need in your build script 
which os and which version of gradle are you using 
can you confirm this was working previously gradle 34 and was broken with gradle 35 rc 1 rc1

do you have a little more detail on where how extension target tests targettests get or else get getorelseget extension target classes targetclasses is used 
why do you need that as part of the inputs 
can you give an example of how this workaround actually works this issue i m having is getting changes in b to see the changes made in c is that possible 
did the test pass for you yes 
what about the following 
would you mind pushing a sample repo to github and sharing it perhaps two build files working gradle and broken gradle to illustrate the problem 
could you consider sending a build scan https gradle com build scans 
would you mind providing a sample project also which java 10 version are you using 
can you clarify where the annotation log j 2 log4j2 is coming from a reproducible example would be helpful 
can you please include the error you are seeing 
what jdk are you using 
would you be interested in providing a pull request for this 
could you please attach a zipped up example project including gradle wrapper sample files so we can reproduce this as quickly as possible 
could you please paste the detailed stack trace you can get it by command line option stacktrace 
what do you mean by substitution 
could you please provide a sample project on git hub github that can directly execute 
what would be your expectation what should happen if a symlink is added to the build cache 
what are you trying to do 
what other information would you expect 
could you provide an example build script where this problem appears could you point me to the xml beans xmlbeans plugin you are using 
which type of console output are you using verbose 
might there be something else in your actual project causing this is there maybe something else named parent in you build script that could cause the unexpected behavior 
can you please add the gradle version and whether this is transient or permanent also what you would expect gradle to do 
can you try 61 rc 1 rc1 and confirm that it fixes the issue for you 
could you try a nightly https gradle org nightly and see if that fixes your problem the issue would be the same as https github com gradle gradle native issues 281 i suppose 
did you try the https github com etiennestuder gradle credentials plugin yet 
can you confirm that the issue already occurs with gradle 40
could you describe more detail 
do you have the java library or java plugins applied across all of your projects what are you running when you see that failure i m assuming gradle okbuck 
can you change your wrapper url to use https 
do they happen with 44 too could you provide a reproducible example do these exceptions go away if you disable configure on demand 
do you mean that when you put provided resolution strategy resolutionstrategy cache dynamic versions for cachedynamicversionsfor 0 time unit timeunit seconds and other lines in the build gradle things work from buildship 
did you find a better alternative 
what part of that advice is incorrect was that not enough what does eol lf do 
what s your use case for publishing properties in the pom unless it s a parent pom i don t see how they could be consumed by a downstream project 
can you elaborate on the use case why would want some dependencies to remain unlocked what s the benefit for the build authors developers working with the code 
could you run with stacktrace or share a build scan please 
could you share the build you re seeing this in marcphilipp oehme anything obvious to check 
can you try upgrading to the latest version of the artifactory plugin you are using 481 and 410 is available 
what makes you think gradle 5 is responsible here does it work without gradle 
can you provide a bit more detail on how you think you d use this do you have any examples you can share 
could you expand on the use case these hooks solve the issue with such hooks is the inability to cache or compute the up to date check 
which version of gradle are you seeing this with and which version did it work halower
can you try running your build with no daemon and see what happens could you be affected by 3117 or 7448
can you please add a readme to the reproducer that shows what works 
do you use the services gradle org url to download the gradle distribution is it possible a previous build step or a periodic clean up job is partially deleting the distribution 
could you describe what you are trying to achieve this would allow to see if what s already available or the in progress things would fulfill that use case 
why you re sure it s gradle issue 
did you look into creating a java platform and using that as the source of version removing versions from build scripts 
did you by any chance configure something that could explain that 
does your project contain source code if not there s nothing to build so nothing to publish 
does nix store kq w v amzgqyflfjh jls zxm f 95kq9w15v4amzgqyflfjh5jls0zxm91f openjdk u ga 8u222ga lib openjdk bin symlink to nix store fgnr fw zy gvg l qhapxhrmqm z 7fgnr4fw1zy3gvg6l09qhapxhrmqm06z openjdk u ga 8u222ga jre lib openjdk bin if so i don t think this will work either 
would that work for you 
what is the solution i have the exact same error 
what modifications did you do to the script that caused the accessors to change 
could you share the exact error message you are getting 
why do you need to add the sources as resources in your project unless you have a particular use case this should not be needed at all 
do you happen to have the environment variable gradle user home set to anything or are you passing g

when you subsequently run say make s are there any build problems or does it compile cleanly 
does iostat mx of the host show the disk to be saturated is the system cpu bound etc 
does it work correctly for primary pool log and cache vdevs 
did you bond the needed dev sys and proc before chroot 
does calling drop caches release the memory echo 3 proc sys vm drop caches 
can the pool now be correctly imported under linux again or do you always see the failure on import 
should it is there supposed to be a offline in one of these 
why do you need to do this 
does everything work properly for a clean shutdown 
what does output 
could you propose a patch for this i m happy to review it 
can you reference an open issue 
can you successfully export zfs via i pv 6 ipv6 is you do it the usual way in linux and not via the sharenfs property 
do you have that one disabled also can you show more of the build log that you re getting 
could it be related to https github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs issues 108 i m not really sure what you re proposing so could you create a pull request against https github com zfsonlinux pkg zfs tag snapshot debian wheezy e e 063015e2282e wheezy which is the latest

which field do you need to focus out of to cause the issue can you attach your metadata xml config file please its in the athlete config folder 
what is your java version hopefully this is not an issue for java 10 but for java 69 pretty much it is 
could you also reproduce this in a non enum type 
how self evident is it  how much effort is it to add this to lombok and this one seems to miss the requisite numbers by a large margin 
maybe we should try to improve the builder code to support such behavior without tolerate 
what compiler do you use eclipse or javac or mvn 
can you please continue this conversation in the previous issue 1139 
can you also find the stacktrace that s printed to the error stderr 
maybe throwables or exceptions i don t like any of those if no good ideas forthcoming by 20181201 close issue 
do you really mean to string tostring exclude my property 1 myproperty1 my property 2 myproperty2 or is it a mental typo and you mean to string tostring exclude my property 1 myproperty1 my property 2 myproperty2 the former is wrong 
what s your java lombok and and ide versions 
can you please try to use an edge release https projectlombok org download edge to check if the problem still exists 
can you test this using the edge release https projectlombok org download edge although not mentioned in the changelog we did improve gradle support 
which lombok version which java version are you using something like gradle could you put a full class including package and imports statements and everything else 
can you tell me the name of the executable and of the ini file 
could you elaborate 
how would you solve this 
why would you want this to what would you change that 
do i understand that this is a regression what version of lombok or jdk did it work last 
why not taking the opposite direction define your fields in the class and the use field name constants fieldnameconstants as enum asenum true to generate your enum 
do you have a specific case that does not work with that 
does file process entity fileprocessentity also has super builder superbuilder if not add it otherwise please post the compiler error also give details and versions of your setup lombok version maven gradle eclipse intellij 
does it act differently for example throw an exception when you do not use j query jquery and instead use direct dom operations 
can you put a complete test case in jsfiddle com or jsbin net 
can you test with http code jquery com jquery git js git2js and see if that fixes the problem we ve switched to using request animation frame requestanimationframe for the next release and that may affect improve the results 
would you like to send us pr for both 
what s the difference between reattach and appending other than remembering the parent 
why do you think that is it documented in http api jquery com each for example 
can t you update to 1112 instead we don t encourage to use out of date versions and migrating from 110 to 111 should be simple 
can you please provide us more details about the code that is causing the issue for example can you reproduce it using js fiddle jsfiddle http jsfiddle net or js bin http jsbin com html css output 
can you provide a test case please 
would you like to submit a pr to take the credit for the perf fix 
what would that value be if no elements were animated if you need a completion for the entire animation look into promise http jsbin com kevorosapu edit html js output
why can t you use require an environment that has module exports but that doesn t allow you to use require sounds broken to me 
do we want to patch it 
would hardcoding the path to sizzle prevent users from re setting it to something else 
could you create a test case at https jsfiddle net or https jsbin com that we could reproduce 
would you like to submit a pr jtrumbull 
can you post a simplified test that doesn t include so much code 
can you provide a test case 
what result do you want to achieve 
could you make sure it s correct and or provide more info 
did you only test chrome what does it do on firefox edge or safari 
could you be more precise in your request 
could you create a test case without external libraries on https jsfiddle net or https jsbin com 
does it only occur when j query jquery manipulates the page or does it happen with standard dom calls as well 
did you just happen to pick that name because it was short and meaningful for your custom need 
can you provide a test case 
can you create a jsfiddle that shows what a bare xhr does 
what file specifically doesn t load for you 
can you provide a test case on js bin https jsbin com qawicop edit html css js output as the issue template requested thanks 
can you post a jsbin or jsfiddle test case 
can you provide a test case on js bin https jsbin com qawicop edit html css js output as the issue template requested thanks the smaller the better 
would you like to try to submit a pr for that 
can you provide a test case on js bin https jsbin com qawicop edit html css js output as the issue template requested thanks 
would you have a simple way to reproduce this 
do you have a stack trace 
does the auto completion works in xcode 
why would it be more efficient please elaborate 
how to you import the library 
did you use the new framework 
what is the problem exactly 
could you past the property definition for your operation property please 
maybe the images are getting invalidated afterwards 
could you please provide a stack trace also try using the zombies instrument to determine the object that is causing the crash and why
could you create a pull request with a fix 
does self executing work for you executing is only visible in the sd web image downloader operation sdwebimagedownloaderoperation class and not in its subclasses
does it work now 
what do you mean by spanning image 
how large are the images you load to your cells if you are using the latest build there some new options to avoid the memory decompression issue check this https github com rs sd web image sdwebimage issues 538 issuecomment 67892084
can you reproduce it all the time 
can you please try with the latest build and report back if the same error occurs 
why dont you reload that request again to show the complete image i will close this as it does not seem to be a problem with the library 
how did you install the files did you just copy them to your project whats the error you are getting exactly 
what s the issue then 
can you replicate using the sample project 
can you share an image url 401 means unauthorized and this indicates an issue with the service providing the images might require an authentication 
what version of cocoa pods cocoapods does it help if you upgrade to the latest one 039
can you try it in the demo project and report back 
can you reproduce it on the demo project 
can you reproduce it on the demo project 
does this make sense 
did you try to load this url in the demo project of 381 version 
can you provide an example that reproduces this 
can you try with the latest one please reopen if you still face issues
can you please conform to the issue template blob master github issue template md on this project 
how did you install the library 
how big are the images you are using 
how did you install sd webimage sdwebimage did you check this https github com rs sd web image sdwebimage animated images gif support 
whats the size a the gif files you are trying to open can you replicate the issue in the demo project also read this https github com rs sd web image sdwebimage issues 1901
could you please attach some stack trace for us to analysis maybe from your app s crash log or some third party services like fabric 
could you please provide a demo that can trigger this crash 
which version of the library are you using 
can you try your demo with the latest x 5x branch ps using retry failed retryfailed doesn t make a difference here as the url is not added to the failed ur ls failedurls array
do you have a url of a webp image you can share that is good to reproduce this issue 
would you try to use sd web image scale down large images sdwebimagescaledownlargeimages option to load this it also crashed 
did you try the 446 version 
can you translate the issue into english if not maybe dreampiggy can take a look 
does it work if you just call clojure core compile manually 
can you be more specific what are you trying to do 
what do you get when setting the env variable debug as in debug 1 lein help debug 1 lein your task 
can you provide a reproduction case where this doesn t happen 
what if we set up o as an alias for with profile offline dev user default that way you could do lein o test or the like which mirrors the way maven works 
what version of leiningen 
do you have rlwrap installed 
doesn t it already support setting uber jar name 
why do you need to know where exactly does user profile come from 
maybe self install placed it in the wrong place 
could you try snapshot 171snapshot on the x 1x branch 
can you try reproducing on the latest from git i would love to see the error message improved but that s a pomegranate issue rather than leiningen i believe 
would there be any adverse effects of not declaring a direct dependency on reply other than causing one more thing to have to be downloaded at runtime 
can you try the servlet api from other sources instead 
can you post automation core are you sure that running the app with lein run does not exhibit the same behavior also leiningen 2 is currently at preview 10 preview10 please upgrade 
can you provide a slimmed down version of your application that shows the issue 
can you provide a repro case outside docker 
what was the line you were trying to use windows xp looks like this should occur only on older systems 
shouldn t that solve the issue in most cases you d like to do some initialization from the application s entrypoint so it is convenient to start in the main namespace 
does the wiki page on proxies have the answer https github com technomancy leiningen wiki http proxies
what would be the correct action here give a more descriptive error message both are expected to be clojure maps if the files exists 
what version of leiningen are you using 
does lein with profile uberjar compile also hang usually this means you re doing something at the top level that should be inside main 
maybe this has changed 
maybe we should wait as long as win xp winxp is supported by oracle jdk oraclejdk clojure leiningen 
could you provide a minimal reproducible example 
what happens if you unset the lein java cmd or set it to d programs java jdk bin jdk17025bin java

can you send me an example script i am not familiar with this functionality 
do you think it s important for them to be lowercase 
what do you think 
does it also happen if you initialize metropolis with mu from advi maybe it matters if the start value contains un transformed keys 
can you confirm which variable this is failing for you can narrow it down by specifying a vars argument for sample ppc 
do you have mkl installed 
where did you get your gfortran from it looks like it may be incompatible with your gcc version 
can you try building from the current 23 branch 
how did you install it 
can you replicate this behavior on another machine 
can you confirm that the model works when you set njobs 1 if so you can try updating theano to the master branch 
what is the error you are getting here 
can you re install and post the log 
can you post a sample just glancing at the code on master i can t spot where that would happen 
would pm density dist densitydist work here see https github com pymc devs pymc blob pymc3blob master pymc examples pymc3examples custom dists py for an example also looks like there s a problem with your code above 
would you be interested in making a pull request to fix this 
can you ask the same question on the theano issue list 
how do you run the nuts sampler have you tried auto init by just calling pm sample n iter 
can you try discarding the theano subdirectory in your home folder and try again sometimes theano gets confused 
can you try with this pr from austin rochford austinrochford https github com pymc devs pymc pull pymc3pull 1459
can you try adding git to the end of the install command so  i wonder if leaving it off installs the release 
did you try the loo in pm stats there is an example here https github com pymc devs pymc blob pymc3blob master docs source notebooks model comparison 20comparison ipynb also could you please move this to our dicourse forum https discourse pymc io thanks 
could you please try updating to master and try again 
can you try upgrading pygpu and libgpuarray it might be related to 2138
will need more details did you install pymc 3 pymc3 conda install c conda forge pymc 3 pymc3 what is the full stack trace 
did you build theano yourself or install it via conda 
could you update to 32 and see if that fixes this the docstring of tree extend is wrong in master as well though i ll submit a fix for that 
did you try to run the test locally to see if the change pass the test 
what do people think about adding this as a kwarg 
do they stall as well if so this may be an issue with pip rather than py mc 3 pymc3 if not though i m not quite sure how to debug this 
do you want to do a pull request to fix this typo 
do you want to submit a pr 
would that suffice or did you have something else in mind 
can you be a little more specific than fields do you mean observation fields i e the more fields section at the bottom of the observation form 
does it look ok to you 
what s the observation url 
would that satisfy you and jakob

maybe a speech bubble would be more appropriate 
can you provide an example of such a kml file 
does this sound at all familiar pleary 
can you still replicate it 
what is your timeline for launching the site 
maybe that s what the issue is 
maybe libc dev libc6dev simply needs to be installed on the system maybe also check out other debian dependencies to see what else should be installed https packages debian org sid rakudo
can you retest now on head there were some related improvements 
maybe something like this 
do the https ur ls urls work if yes i d suggest using them as a first step will look into a proper solution later 
can someone else try 
can you i suspect that f f b c af e 355 090f3f1b45c1af1e355 fixed this also 
can you do that and try again

when do you have this error message can you give us a small template to reproduce this thanks 
maybe you can describe a bit more what you want to do 
whats bom 
can you add a ticket on symfony trac thanks 
maybe you forgot to specify an isset method or maybe your get returns null 
don t you mean tags instead of blocks otherwise i m curious about what blocks you re talking about 
why not just create an instance of the class and pass it as a global calling a static method on an object works perfectly fine 
what is the problem you are trying to solve 
might be a regression introduced with the new embed tag stuff heckur can you provide a quick couple of templates which reproduces this

could it be that your own template is overwriting fos user bundle fosuserbundle layout html twig meaning that it would then actually extend itself 
can you give me a small script that reproduces the issue i must be missing something here 
can you provide a minimal test that fails i ve just tried and using an integer on php 7 works for me

did this occur with dp 3 dp3
what version of quicksilver are you running 
could you try temporarily disabling removing that plug in to see if it makes any difference 
which interface are you using 
do any messages relating to quicksilver show up in console app 
do you have this enabled 
do you have the dock icon visible or hidden 
maybe that should go into b 70 b70

which backend are you using if it s the simple backend like your other issue your search index searchindex subclass doesn t do anything since the simple backend won t modify the database 
can you please format the json for readability and use
does this patch work for your project https github com acdha django haystack commit c a bff b fce fd d b f d 77416c0a402bff06591b9fce4fd75d3946b02f6d

can you test this with the latest haystack release which search engine backend are you using do you have a reproducible test case 
did you not see http github com robey paramiko issues issue 3
could you provide a minimal code example that causes the problem and describe what happens when you use normal open ssh i suspect you need a try except block 
can you please try recreating this on paramiko x 115x a lot has changed since x 110x 
can you clarify the exact issue you re having maybe no valid connections error novalidconnectionserror being raised is a red herring 
do those connections work ok prior to packaging via py exe py2exe what are the nature of the keys and ciphers involved etc more info needed 
maybe this should be an option 
what was the code that used paramiko what were the arguments to the ssh process which worked etc 
what s not working 
maybe we should just document the process somewhere would that suffice
