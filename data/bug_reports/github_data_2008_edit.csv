rails/rails,https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/33091,rails_rails_issues_33091,"JSON serialization behaves incorrectly when a column alias has the same name as an instance method

### Steps to reproduce 1. Have an ApplicationRecord with a function that takes no parameters, named my_name(). 2. On a Relation of that class, have a select statement that aliases a column to my_name, for instance: MyModel.where(some_condition).select(""field1 AS my_name""). 3. Render this relation to JSON. ### Expected behavior The JSON generated should simply be a hash of the results of the select query. ### Actual behavior The JSON generated overwrites the value of the my_name entries with the results of calling the my_name() function for each record in the relation. ### System configuration **Rails version**: 5.1.6 **Ruby version**: 2.5.0 ## Example Here's a simplified version of the code in my project that caused the problem. I'm using PostgreSQL; time is stored in the database as an integer representing a number of seconds; this is more suitable for my purposes than an interval column.  ## Workaround This can be worked around by overriding read_attribute_for_serialization, with something like the following:  (Note: you may wonder why one would want to have a column alias that is the same as a method name. The reason is that you may want to perform some post-processing of the stored data before rendering it to JSON. When doing this for a single Record, it's simplest to have a method with that name, and then pass methods: :my_name. When rendering a group of records to JSON, however, it's more efficient to have that processing done by the database itself, as part of the select query. Whichever way we do the processing, we want it to have the same key in the generated JSON.)",Can you please provide a sample application that reproduces the issue?,"## Example Here's a simplified version of the code in my project that caused the problem.

rails/rails,https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/33460,rails_rails_issues_33460,"Writing a link_to method in helper and a URL with request parameter under certain ""if else"" statement crashes Rails sever with Abort trap: 6

This is a very **very** specific bug and should not be much of a problem when using Rails normally, but I have encountered this problem somehow, and narrowed down the problem a bit, so I will give some examples and the outcome of it. Hope this helps fix some weird bugs out there maybe. ### Steps to reproduce In any rails application, 1. create any helper method that satisfies the following conditions under app/helpers. - Write a condition with if true ... else ... OR if false ... else ... - Write the process under the statement that will never be used. For example, if you write it with if true then you must write your process under the else statement and vice versa. - Write a path using the link_to helper and a url_helper which contains a request parameter. For example I will create a helper method like below.  OR you can write it like this.  2. use the helper method inside any view files under app/views/.... Create a controller and route it if necessary. For this example I will create some_view erb template and a WebPagesController, and route it accordingly.    3. start your rails server. 4. Access the view. For this instance, localhost:3000/web_pages/some_view ### Expected behavior It should not crash, but instead, should render the process under either if or else depending on the true or false condition that you have specified. ### Actual behavior The server will crash with a log similar to the one below.  ### System configuration **Rails version**: Rails 5.2.0 **Ruby version**: ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-darwin14] ### Side Note This bug will not occur in the following conditions. So the following program will work correctly. 1. Write the true false condition statement in any variable like the following.  2. Do not write the process under the statement that will never be used.  3. Do not give the url_helper with a request parameter.  4. Writing the method's process directly in the view template.  ### Status update - 7/31/2018 21:00 JST It seems that when you start up the server (which loads the helper method), and this specific method is not commented out, it will crash the server when you try to render any views. Even if that view does not invoke the said method. On the other hand, if you write the helper method after you have started up your server(like you would normally when developing the application), it is possible to explore other pages, until you try to access the said method in a view, causing it to reload the helper, thus wiping the application.",Can you create a reproduce application your issue?,"#### Update 7/31/2018 21:00 JST It seems that when the server loads the helper method, and this specific method is not commented out, it will crash the server when you try to render any views.

Page 2 and Page 3 do still have the same cache_key. The workaround I used to fix this in our project is by removing the scope, calculating the cache_key and appending the scope-values to that key:  This way every page still has its own cache-entry, but when any product is changed, all the pages are invalidated.

One example is on https://openlibrary.org/search/authors?q=john+o%27reilly where if I click on https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL7317095A it shows 1 work. There are so many like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55302685/71531571-20e75300-28a4-11ea-9660-ad7d3c2e0a5b.png) So I'm proposing a reword from ""**0 books**, including"") to say instead: ""**# Ebooks**, # Works, # Editions"". Then the number will show the true number of works for books, followed by the sum total of editions for all the works combined. I understand now that 'books' meant 'ebooks' - and since there's an ambiguity between the cataloged works in the OL and the actual scans in the IA - using 'ebooks' would discern that it's about the IA availability, not the OL records. I mean, better yet would be: ""**# Ebooks Available**, # Ebooks, # Works, # Editions""",What value would it add to the user?,"Works, # I understand now that 'books' meant 'ebooks' - and since there's an ambiguity between the cataloged works in the OL and the actual scans in the IA - using 'ebooks' would discern that it's about the IA availability, not the OL records."
internetarchive/openlibrary,https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/2671,internetarchive_openlibrary_issues_2671,"Update issue triage definition and Wiki

### Describe the solution you'd like <!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --> Redefine the repo's definition of triage to make the process more streamline and time-efficient. Related: #2672 ### Philosophy As Open Library grows, the amount of work that needs to be done is _much larger_ than the amount of time the developers have. There are two ways to combat this: 1. Increase the amount of developers 1. Streamline the workflow for completing issues and merging pull requests. This issue and associated pull requests are designed to: 1. Decrease the barrier of entry for new collaborators to contribute to the project. 1. Minimize the amount of time developers spend handling issues and pull requests. 1. Wrangle issues that are irrelevant, solved, or contain useful information for current ongoing projects. ### Proposal <!-- What is the proposed solution / implementation? Is there a precedent of this approach succeeding elsewhere? --> - [ ] An issue is triaged when we can answer the following two questions: 1. _Is this a legitimate issue_? - I.e: Is this actually a bug? Do we actually want to implement this feature? 1. _How urgent is this issue_? - Is this issue related to an open Epic/milestone/project? 1. Practical changes - We don't necessarily need to know how to resolve an issue for it to be triaged. The underlying problem of a bug or code needed to create a feature can be a mystery. - Triaged ~labels~ issues do not need an assignee. As long as the issue has a Type, State, and Priority it is considered triaged. - If an issue is legitimate but not considered urgent, a contributor can leave the labeled issue in the backlog without further investigation and still be compliant with this triaging process. - It is encouraged for contributors to provide relevant files or information that would make resolving the issue easier for new contributors to the project. - [x] Rename Needs: Assessment to Needs: Triage and add the label Needs: Investigation to the set of available labels. - _Rationale_: Needs: Assessment has been used for marking an untriaged issue and marking an issue as needing more investigation. - [x] Add a Type: Question label and corresponding issue template #2753 ~- [ ] Add Needs: Triage~ - [ ] Add State: Backlogged to all issue templates EDIT: the usefulness of the State label is being contested besides Blocked - [ ] Rephrase the issue template from ""Describe the solution you'd like,"" it says something more along the lines of ""Describe the problem that you'd like solved."" per https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/2671#issuecomment-561401800 #2753 - [x] Rename css to Module: CSS and make it a managed label - [x] Rename publicapis to Theme: Public APIs and make it a managed label - [x] Rename Editing to Theme: Editing and make it a managed label _Added from 2019-12-17 Community Call_ - [ ] Change Priority label formatting. I.e Priority 2: High to Priority: 2 assigned to @tfmorris - [ ] Triaged labels need a Module? - [ ] Triaged labels need a Theme? <!-- Which suggestions or requirements should be considered for how feature needs to appear or be implemented? --> ### Constraints 1. This process is dependent on a triager or triagers labeling incoming issues. It also requires contributors complying to the labeling Wiki. 1. Determining the ""urgency"" of a project is dependent on Open Library managing issues in milestones/project or some other type of public-facing road map. 1. It is still possible for issues ""lost"". I.e issues that were a work-in-progress, but were abandoned by the assignee for technical problems or other reasons. Example: #333 . 1. Some devs have requested a way to ""score"" issues so that it was easier to decide which were first on the todo list. The above changes don't provide a scoring system. 1. The proposed changes don't set expectations for triaged issues.. We many need to publicly state somewhere that large significant features can be triaged, but may not be implemented as the issue author requested. ### Stakeholders <!-- @ tag stakeholders of this bug --> @brad2014 @mekarpeles","What if people self-assign some of the lower ones and get offered higher privileges, in which they accept or not?",1. Rename Editing to Theme: Editing and make it a managed label
