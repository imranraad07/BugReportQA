JuliaLang/julia,https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/25904,JuliaLang_julia_issues_25904,"Julep: broadcast with dictionaries

### Current behavior I just learned that apparently broadcast doesn't work as I expected on dictionaries:  AFAICT it seems broadcast is working on dictionaries like they are scalars or something. Someone correct me if I'm wrong - but maybe we never added any broadcast methods for dictionaries? ### Proposal Make broadcast work with dictionaries. I can see two possibilities, of which I favor option 2: 1. broadcast for 1D indexable containers generally works like map, so we can extend this to AbstractDict and have broadcast map the key-value pairs 2. broadcast deals with matching indices and performing some operation on *values*. So broadcast(f, dict) could be a bit like map(f, values(dict)) except the dictionary structure and it's indices are preserved in the output. It seems to me that map deals with the iteration protocol and broadcast is more about matching indices and mapping those values. Using option 2 would give:  IMO this kind of syntax could help a lot with manipulating dictionaries (one example is using AbstractDict for output of groupby-style operations, and then acting on the groups) while making no breaking changes to dictionary iteration or map. To me it also dovetails with the ""getindices julep"" via this comment https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/24019#issuecomment-363253768 which basically suggests we can get multi-valued getindex between different indexable container types including dictionaries via the lowering transformation:  ### EDIT: Addendum (27/07/2019) I forgot to mention a crucial use case of broadcasting over dictionaries where you have two or more dictionaries with the same keys and you want to match up the values based on the keys. For example dict1 .+ dict2. For our hash-based Dict, the user can't really predict the iteration order and they may actually differ between dict1 and dict2 even if the user can guarantee that they share the same *set* of keys (for example, dict2 might have been rehashed and dict1 not, but IMO this implementation detail shouldn't affect the semantics of the broadcast operation).",Do you mind if we try to keep all the discussion consolidated there?,"### EDIT: Addendum (27/07/2019) I forgot to mention a crucial use case of broadcasting over dictionaries where you have two or more dictionaries with the same keys and you want to match up the values based on the keys.

### Current behavior I just learned that apparently broadcast doesn't work as I expected on dictionaries:  AFAICT it seems broadcast is working on dictionaries like they are scalars or something. Someone correct me if I'm wrong - but maybe we never added any broadcast methods for dictionaries? ### Proposal Make broadcast work with dictionaries. I can see two possibilities, of which I favor option 2: 1. broadcast for 1D indexable containers generally works like map, so we can extend this to AbstractDict and have broadcast map the key-value pairs 2. broadcast deals with matching indices and performing some operation on *values*. So broadcast(f, dict) could be a bit like map(f, values(dict)) except the dictionary structure and it's indices are preserved in the output. It seems to me that map deals with the iteration protocol and broadcast is more about matching indices and mapping those values. Using option 2 would give:  IMO this kind of syntax could help a lot with manipulating dictionaries (one example is using AbstractDict for output of groupby-style operations, and then acting on the groups) while making no breaking changes to dictionary iteration or map. To me it also dovetails with the ""getindices julep"" via this comment https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/24019#issuecomment-363253768 which basically suggests we can get multi-valued getindex between different indexable container types including dictionaries via the lowering transformation:  ### EDIT: Addendum (27/07/2019) I forgot to mention a crucial use case of broadcasting over dictionaries where you have two or more dictionaries with the same keys and you want to match up the values based on the keys. For example dict1 .+ dict2. For our hash-based Dict, the user can't really predict the iteration order and they may actually differ between dict1 and dict2 even if the user can guarantee that they share the same *set* of keys (for example, dict2 might have been rehashed and dict1 not, but IMO this implementation detail shouldn't affect the semantics of the broadcast operation).",Do you mind if we try to keep all the discussion consolidated there?,"### EDIT: Addendum (27/07/2019) I forgot to mention a crucial use case of broadcasting over dictionaries where you have two or more dictionaries with the same keys and you want to match up the values based on the keys.

The rationale is that it pushes package authors to use AbstractSparseMatrixCSC interface so that subtypes of it other than SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC would work for their code. <strike>This is technically OK since those fields are not a part of the public API.</strike> (Edit: It may not be considered completely private.

PROBLEM SOLVED TEMPORARILY (WORK AROUND) BY: .is-active > .accordion-title {background-color:#CC000 !important;} and removing the colors from global .accordian-title.

CONTAINERS > ACCORDIAN The basics right off the 6.5.3 DOCS https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/accordion.html I've used a bare bones Foundation 6.5.3 XY GRID set up downloaded directly from the latest build on github.

We should be able to change the background color of an .accordian-title when it is is-active Currently it is easy to set :hover and :focus - why not is-active - This is important for usability. I looked at the javascript files and while I can see hooks for hover and focus, I don't see it for is-active. We should be able to set is-active background-color and is-active font color. While the PLUS and MINUS Icons are important as well (they activate on .accordian-title is-active ::before and ::after) as they do not rely on color - being able to change color as well is imperative for usability and accessibility. This should apply to both parent and child (nested) acordian titles without losing the ability to manipulate the color of the + - symbols as well. ... What happens instead?

However, dSYMs are not currently supported. At PSPDFKit, we currently bundle the CocoaPods artifact as the old fat .frameworks, and we plan on distributing XCFrameworks as soon as CocoaPods supports dSYMs in its latest stable version, as dSYM support is crucial for our customers. ## How the Manual Integration with dSYM supports works: You can manually integrate XCFrameworks into your project and add the dSYMs using an .xcfilelist, as described in the second step of this guide here: https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/getting-started/integrating-pspdfkit/#integrating-the-xcframework ## How to Test: ### Create the Local PSPDFKit CocoaPods Artifacts: 1. If you’re an existing customer, download PSPDFKit for iOS from the [customer portal](https://customers.pspdfkit.com/). Otherwise, if you don’t already have PSPDFKit, [sign up for our 60-day trial](https://pspdfkit.com/try/) and you will receive an email with the download instructions. 2. Copy PSPDFKit.xcframework, PSPDFKitUI.xcframework, PSPDFKit-dSYMs, and PSPDFKitUI-dSYMs in a writable location. 3. Remove strip-bitcode.sh and strip-framework.sh from PSPDFKit.xcframework/*/PSPDFKit.framework:  4. Rename the PSPDFKit-dSYMs and PSPDFKitUI-dSYMs foldersto PSPDFKit.dSYMs, and PSPDFKitUI.dSYMs respectively. 5. Create an archive (.zip file) by compressing PSPDFKit.xcframework, PSPDFKitUI.xcframework, PSPDFKit.dSYMs, and PSPDFKitUI.dSYMs into PSPDFKit.zip. 6. Rename the resulting Archive.zip to PSPDFKit.zip. ### Integrate PSPDFKit using CocoaPods Beta in a Sample Project: - Install CocoaPods beta on your Mac: sudo gem install cocoapods --pre. In my tests, I used 1.9.3.beta.3 in my tests - Download the attached sample project ([CocoaPods-dSYM-Support.zip](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/files/4187431/CocoaPods-dSYM-Support.zip)) and unzip it. - cd into the project directory: cd CocoaPods-dSYM-Support/SwiftExample - Copy the CocoaPods artifacts (PSPDFKit.zip) in the root folder (CocoaPods-dSYM-Support). - run pod install. - Open the sample project in Xcode 11.3.1: open SwiftExample/SwiftExample.xcworkspace. - Create an archive: In Xcode UI go to Product > Archive. - Inspect the dSYMs in the archive an notice that the PSPDFKit dSYMs are not present. <img width=""405"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-02-11 at 9 29 35 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7443038/74246207-282aba80-4cb2-11ea-9444-67a746b9d739.png""> ## Proposed Outcome: - dSYMs should be automatically added when using XCFrameworks, just like when using fat .frameworks.","Did you try that and, if so, did it not work correctly?","UI.xcframework, PSPDFKit.dSYMs, and PSPDFKitUI.dSYMs into PSPDFKit.zip. 6.

linuxmint/cinnamon,https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/8345,linuxmint_cinnamon_issues_8345,"grouped-window-list: Closing window by middle mouse button makes all panels stuck

* Cinnamon version: Cinnamon 4.0.9 * Distribution: Mint 19.1 * Graphics hardware *and* driver used: NVIDIA Quadro K2000M / Nvidia Driver 390.77 * 64 bit * [xsession-errors-copy.log](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/files/2800331/xsession-errors-copy.log) **-Issue-** I use an automatically hiding panel with the new _grouped-window-list_ applet introduced in Mint 19.1 Tessa Cinnamon Edition. When I close any window with my middle mouse button in the list, the given panel stucks and does not auto-hide anymore. If you have more than one auto-hiding panel, hovering above them and back makes them appear and stuck also. Only restarting Cinnamon session can solve the problem for me. The other window-closing alternatives does not do the same to the panel (using ""x"" button on its header / closing from window icon's right-click ""Close"" button on the panel / closing from the thumbnail view of the hovered window icon on the panel). _UPDATE 1:_ Another strange behaviour: In one case I CAN close the window with the middle button without stucking the panels in place - if the mouse is not above the panel in the moment of the window closing. I did find an application which responds on the close command slower than others, also I was fast enough to drag the mouse away after middle clicking. In this situation panels keep working on as it is expected. **-Steps to reproduce-** 1. Put the new grouped-window-list applet on an auto-hiding panel (right click on the panel -> Panel Settings -> Hide panel automatically, if it's not done before). 2. After adding it to the panel, open the applet's settings window, and make sure that the ""Middle mouse button function"" is set to ""Close lastly focused window in the group"" (or something like this... I don't know... my system is Hungarian... :stuck_out_tongue: ) 3. Close any of your opened windows with the middle mouse button 4. Be angry... or not... **-Expected behaviour-** The clicked window is closing, and all panels continue to auto-hide. **-Other information-** Most of the time I have only one display with one window-listing panel, but I often use two more displays, and one more panel on each one with one more window lists on each one. By this, I can see on the gven screen only the windows which are on that screen. Even when these window lists are not used, the system can see them, and window list settings are available for them. The problem occures in both situations: one display / three displays. I can see this issue from the day I've updated from Mint 19 to 19.1, but the part of the middle mouse button was discovered by me only today... at last... :smile:",Does this occur if you remove any non-cinnamon applets/desklets/extensions?,"UPDATE 1:** Another strange behaviour: In one case I CAN close the window with the middle button without stucking the panels in place - if the mouse is not above the panel in the moment of the window closing.

The position changes with different _factor_ s, e.g. try 0.02 for some other position. So, apparently there are two bugs here: 1. the obvious one is in **tight_layout.py** line 361: _auto_adjust_subplotpars()_ may return None as a result, but the result (_kwargs_) is then accessed with _kwargs[""left""]_ on line 379 ...

Hello, I am sure this has been brought up before but I am not quite sure where specifically to look. I am trying to run SLSQP method on a highly non-linear objective function with non-linear inequality constraints for an engineering project that I am working on. I have 100+ variables I am considering. When I first ran this code my end solution vector consisted of ""nan's"". I assumed that the reason for this was because the 'eps' value resulted in numerical instability with respect to calculating the Jacobian, so I set 'eps': 0.0001 and ended with a result that was not 'nan's' but violated the pre-specified constraints. In particular, many of the resulting coordinate points were stacked on top of each other. Any ideas on how to circumvent this issue or why it is happening? My only guess is that given this new 'eps' value I have established, the estimation for the constraints are less precise and result in constraint violations. How can I manage constraint violations while at the same time preserve numerical stability? I should also mention that I have tried to run COBYLA and Trust-const as well, but they are unfortunately computationally slow with respect to this particular problem.

I have a complex case that probably is an edge bug. If it is not I also appreciate some directions on how to proceed.

We have a directory in our main git repo that contains a composer project ""core"" this project is our monolith application. In the core we also use a parent folder with thrift definitions that are shared among many projects, this folder is included as a namespace in the core (not as dependency). And in the monolith it works perfectly. Now we are trying to use the core folder as a library (as well as an application on itself) to other projects. Since the shared folder is included as part of source for the core project the expectation is that the shared folder would be included as well. The problem is that the shared folder is not being included. My guess is that the problem is because the source path is a relative one inside a dependency and references a outside folder, seems like composer somehow cannot distinguish between the dependency relative path and the current project relative path.

composer/composer,https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/8381,composer_composer_issues_8381,"Question: How to semver patch a patch? e.g. use a specific tag

## Problem / Motivation This issues is to help everyone understand what to do when you need to ""patch a patch,"" i.e. insert a tag between two PATCH versions. Imagine you have a project that has the following versions as tags in the repository: * 1.0.59 - Includes Features A and B * 1.0.60 - Includes Features A, B, C, D, E, and F The 1.0.59 version is deployed to production. The 1.0.60 version is not schedule to go to production for another 5 days and you need a hotfix deployed today. You can't release 1.0.60 because there are features that haven't been QA'd yet, some of them may have bugs. We need to move more quickly. **How do I tag a release in such a way that composer will accept it and it complies with [semver](https://semver.org/)?** ## Options to Consider It sounds like there are a few paths that could be taken in theory, let's make the assumption they all require *telling* anyone using the 1.0.59 version to use a specific other version, i.e. no one can just do a composer update to pull in the hotfix in the scenario outlined above. Also, we'll assume you can't simply re-create the tags. ### Option 1: Claim it's a release management issue. You could argue that the issue is with the release management process or correct use of version numbers. If 1.0.59 and 1.0.60 are releases of features, why didn't the *MINOR* version increase? Why are you not tagging a release candidate or pre-release version instead of an actual patch since QA hasn't been completed? This is a long term solution, it doesn't solve the immediate problem of needing to patch a patch. ### Option 2: Use a 4 digit version. [violates Semver] Semver supports only 3 digits, X.y.z, but composer supports 4 digits. This is a viable option as long as you have nothing preventing you from creating a 4 digit version and you're OK with violating semver. For example, use 1.0.59.1 as the hotfix version. ### Option 3: Use composer patches. Release a patch file to the 1.0.59 version. Have everyone using the 1.0.59 version to add this patch to their composer.json file using [composer patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches). ### Option 4: Composer to support specifying a tag name. [theoretical] Composer supports pinning to a specific commit hash or a branch name. It does not support pinning to a tag name. This scenario would require composer changing to support specifying a specific tag name. Perhaps this could be achieved by composer mapping an arbitrary tag to a commit hash and pinning against that commit hash. In turn, this would allow support for semver build metadata, e.g. 1.0.59+hotfix. ### Option 5: Use a branch instead of a tag. Create a branch off 1.0.59 like so:  Add changes to this branch. Have everyone using the 1.0.59 version to use the hotfix/foo branch with composer require vendor/package:dev-hotfix/foo. Never delete the branch. ### Option 6: Use a pre-release tag. [violates Semver] Use a tag like 1.0.59-patch1. While this does work with composer it violates Semver, which states that a tag with a hyphen - is a pre-release and has ""a lower precedence than the associated normal version."" So, 1.0.59-patch1 should come *before* 1.0.59 in your version history, which would not be the case here. ### Option 7: Reference the commit of a build tag. [requires disclaimer] While composer doesn't support referencing a tag name such as a build tag (i.e. a tag that has build information), you can reference the commit hash a tag points to. This solution would involve creating a branch from the tag:  Add changes to this branch. Tag the branch with 1.0.59+patch1. Have everyone using the 1.0.59 version to use the 1.0.59+patch1 tag by referencing the commit the tag points to like so: composer require vendor/package:dev-master#d3f9f1b. You can now delete the hotfix/foo branch, but you must keep the master branch. Please read the [disclaimer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#i-have-locked-a-dependency-to-a-specific-commit-but-get-unexpected-results-) if using this. The composer.json metadata will be read from the master branch, so for example if a additional dependency gets added to the master composer.json anyone using the 1.0.59+patch1 will also read that additional dependency. ## Proposed Resolution The long term resolution would be Option 1: Claim it's a release management issue. In the short term, these options are all viable: * Option 2: Use a 4 digit version. [violates Semver] * Option 3: Use composer patches. * Option 5: Use a branch instead of a tag. * Option 6: Use a pre-release tag. [violates Semver] * Option 7: Reference the commit of a build tag. [requires disclaimer] Composer has made it clear that Option 4: Composer to support specifying a tag name is not going to happen. ### Commentary / Opinion Option 1 is clearly the ""right"" answer, but given what I've seen in my research there is a need for a short term solution. Here's my opinion about those: Option 3 requires too much effort and coordination compared to the alternatives. I would throw this out. Option 4 is a non starter. So, we are left with 2, 5, 6, and 7. Options 2 and 6 are the best fit if you do not need to comply with Semver. Option 2 is logical: the 4th digit is a sequence of changes to the 3rd digit. Option 6 at least is formatted like Semver but those familiar with Semver might be confused why a pre-release happened after a release. Options 5 and 7 are the best fit for complying with Semver and also have composer support. Option 5 has the downside of needing to keep a branch. Option 7 has the serious downside of the [disclaimer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#i-have-locked-a-dependency-to-a-specific-commit-but-get-unexpected-results-) that composer will read the metdata from the specified branch. **Which option is the best choice is contextual. If I had to pick one, I would go with Option 2: Use a 4 digit version. While it violates Semver it has the least risk, least effort, and least confusion.** ## Related Information * [Support letters in version strings #4330](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4330) - Makes the point Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence. from semver docs, and that build metadata shouldn't be *silently* ignored. * [Refactoring #13](https://github.com/composer/semver/pull/13#discussion-diff-36172250) - Point that build metadata should be ignored * [Validate schema name, type and version #8262 ](https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/8262) - Discussion about how 4 digit version numbers are allowed * [SemverTest.php#L100](https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/master/tests/SemverTest.php#L100) - Shows there are tests for build meta, but no tests for 4 digit version numbers * [VersionParserTest.php#L56](https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/master/tests/VersionParserTest.php#L56) - Shows normalized versions are parsed to 4 digit versions * [Allow arbitrary tag names #8071](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/8071#issuecomment-480192641) - Talks about composer supporting arbitrary patch names, but how determining priority would be unpredictable * [Possible to reference branch#tag in github? #6206](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/6206) - You cannot reference a specific tag; and the fact you can reference a specific commit hash is a legacy hack, see [this issue](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#i-have-locked-a-dependency-to-a-specific-commit-but-get-unexpected-results-) * [Handling hotfix versions #241](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/241) - Discussion about using version suffixes to handle the ""patch to a patch"" case * [Supporting multiple versions and backporting fixes that introduce features or break things #532](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/532) - A conversation about the difficulties of managing multiple versions you need to patch while complying with semver. * [Discussion: pre-release versioning and PEP440 cross-compatibility #483](https://github.com/semver/semver/issues/483) - A discussion comparing semver with PEP440 which brings up some interesting challenges with versioning to consider","How introducing features C, D, E, and F in a *PATCH* version is intended to be compatible with the semantic versioning spec?","of an actual patch This is a long term solution, it doesn't solve the immediate problem of needing to patch a patch."

emscripten-core/emscripten,https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9837,emscripten-core_emscripten_issues_9837,"Invalid URLs (absolute paths) in source maps in some cases

## Summary Source maps are supposed to contain only valid URLs in the sources array (either relative, or absolute with scheme). Emscripten sometimes emits absolute paths into that array instead, making them impossible to load by a browser. ## Examples For a file C:\Users\rreverser\Projects\temp-wasm\temp.c with arbitary content in a folder temp-wasm, I'm trying different formats for the filename. Note that this is not a Windows-specific issue, and you'll get same results with Unix filepaths. 1. Running emcc ./temp.c -g4 -o temp.wasm (relative filename in the same folder):  2. Running emcc temp.c -g4 -o temp.wasm (same relative filename, but without explicit ./):  3. Running emcc ../temp-wasm/temp.c (relative filename with a folder):  4. Running emcc C:\Users\rreverser\Projects\temp-wasm\temp.c -g4 -o temp.wasm (absolute filename):  ## Results When a filename is relative but without a leading ./ or is specified as absolute, Emscripten outputs an absolute filename in sources, which is not a valid URL and can't be handled by DevTools. It could be valid if prefixed with file:/// specifier, but that's not an ideal solution. The only case where Emscripten sources ends up being valid URL is when a filename is specified as explicitly relative (cases 1 and 3). Then, Emscripten outputs a relative URL as well, which can be handled well by DevTools both in case of loading from filesystem as well as a static HTTP server. More so, even though case 3 outputs a relative filename, it's not ideal. ## Suggested solution Emscripten should always compute relative URL out of the source map filename and the actual sources, and emit that in sources array.",Maybe related to https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/7481/files ?,"./temp.c""],""names"":[],... js {""version"":3,""sources"":[""../temp-wasm/temp.c (relative filename with a folder):  4.

emscripten-core/emscripten,https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/7649,emscripten-core_emscripten_issues_7649,"Improvements to the Emscripten / WebAssembly API

Proposed Emscripten / WebAssembly API Changes ===================================== Since late September 2018, I've been implementing a straightforward translation layer from host calls from Emscripten-generated WebAssembly to the C library of the underlying host. The result today is a WebAssembly runtime that fully implements all the required functionality to run an unmodified version of [Nginx compiled with Emscripten](https://www.wasmjit.org/blog/nginx-on-wasmjit.html). While it works, there were a few modifications I would make to the existing Emscripten<->WebAssembly API to correct some inadequacies, simplify the translation logic, and optimize the translation logic. These changes are proposed as minor edits to the existing API but long term it would be good if we could fully document the existing API with the intention of publishing it as a POSIX API standard for WebAssembly. I'm looking for feedback on these proposals before I potentially start working on a patch for Emscripten. ## 1. Include memory layout information in WASM binary (Critical) (DONE 0d835468332186ede066ab8b529c0d0a4870cb03) The WASM module produced by Emscripten requires a few exports from the host to run successfully: * memoryBase / __memory_base * __table_base * tempDouble * DYNAMICTOP_PTR * STACKTOP * STACK_MAX The value of these exports depend on the target STATIC_BUMP value. This value is not encoded in the generated WASM file itself, and must be parsed out from the accompanying .js file. I propose the STATIC_BUMP value be encoded in a custom ""Emscripten Metadata"" section in the generated WASM file. ## 2. Compiling with -O3 shouldn't minify WebAssembly import names (critical) (DONE 28522838619d45f508b2e9ed1f7b9aa4d3cad9aa) This was recently changed in Emscripten. -O3 now by default mangles import names. I propose the default -O3 doesn't mangle the import names, and an extra option be added to do that extra minification if desired. Alternatively maintaining the current behavior and adding an option to disable the name mangling is another options. ## 3. Compile straight to .wasm file (recommended) (DONE 28522838619d45f508b2e9ed1f7b9aa4d3cad9aa) It should be possible to specify a .wasm file as the output file. Right now you must specify a file ending in .js, when the .js file isn't always necessary. ## 4. Include table layout information in WASM binary (Critical) (DONE 0d835468332186ede066ab8b529c0d0a4870cb03) The WASM module generated by Emscripten imports its index-zero table from the host. The expected size of this table is not generic and must be parsed out from the accompanying .js file as well. I propose either: * that the import parameters for the table allow a generically sized table * the table size is encoded in a custom ""Emscripten Metadata"" similar section in the generated WASM file. ## 5. off_t and ino_t should be 64-bits (Critical) (DONE 4e4a7946964cb3d45cd2f1af4bcee38e585318c4) Most file systems support 64-bit off_t and ino_t. The WASM generated by Emscripten expects a 32-bit off_t and ino_t. This is a problem when delegating the host functions required by the generated WASM file directly to the host's C library since it's not possible to return the full value produced by the host to the hosted WASM. I propose we convert off_t and ino_t to 64-bits. ## 6. More POSIX types should be 64-bits (Recommended) Emscripten ends up using 32-bit versions of many POSIX structures, whereas the host implementation usually uses 64-bit values in its corresponding structures. While pointers might always necessarily be 32-bits in value and don't make sense in host context without conversion to host pointers first anyway, there are a few POSIX structures that in theory could be directly forwarded to the host implementation. Examples include struct timespec, struct stat, struct tm, and more. If Emscripten encoded these using 64-bit integer values, then no conversion step would be required on the most popular data model on POSIX systems for the foreseeable future, LP64. ## 7. POSIX API, not System Call API (Recommended) At first, it seemed like the API between Emscripten-generated WebAssembly and the Emscripten host should be based on system calls implied by POSIX. This doesn't work in the case of higher-level APIs that have implementation-defined behavior. Examples include: readdir() and friends, getgrent and friends, getpwent and friends, sem_post() and friends, and more. Emscripten currently uses musl library code to implement readdir() and requires the host to implement the getdents64() system call. Only Linux provides an API that has getdents64() semantics, other POSIX systems like OpenBSD and macOS provide slightly similar but incompatible APIs and furthermore those APIs are unsupported. POSIX only requires that implementations provide readdir() and friends. It would be better for Emscripten-generated WebAssembly to generate calls to host-defined readdir() and friends instead of getdents64() to more easily implement the API on all POSIX systems. This requires some modification to the Emscripten's version of musl which adds extra complexity but I think is overall worth it. ## 8. Better function signatures for system calls (Recommended) This is related to the previous recommendation: right now the system call API names the system call by number (e.g. _syscall220). Also the arguments to the system calls are passed in a buffer instead of as WebAssembly function arguments, this requires extra work on the host implement to decode the arguments. I propose all APIs use descriptive names and pass arguments normally instead of in an indirect buffer. ## 9. API function calls are responsible for setting Errno (Recommended) Right now some Emscripten APIs expect the system call to return a negative errno number to signal error, and some return the error in the errno value. I think all APIs should behave similarly for consistency.",Do we not follow the POSIX or other relevant APIs when doing so? Maybe we have some bugs there.,1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

This works well, not only presenting the QPMID in the post but also filtering properly if used in the shortcode: [pods name=project template=MyProjects where = ""project_creator.QPMID.meta_value='654bc438-eee8-409c-b855-b15500764116'""] Here is the post list, which in effect **simulates the #Expected Behavior**: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58439210/80548266-88afc680-8988-11ea-8f66-fc22b47a0a0b.png) The MyProjects pods template is: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58439210/80550750-18587380-898f-11ea-8901-ba3324ec8293.png) Thus the first value, project_creator.QPMID.meta_value, seems to work well. The value to compare it with is the QPMID of the current user. This is returned by {@user.id,get_QPMID}. get_QPMID() is a simple snippet to get any user's QPMID, and was used in the above template to display the post author's QPMID. Here is the Code Snippets entry: function get_QPMID($user_id) { $key = 'QPMID'; $single = true; $user_QP = get_user_meta( $user_id, $key, $single ); return $user_QP; } To find out if a pods shortcode can use the function above to return the QPMID of the current user, I ran the following shortcode: [pods name=project where = ""post_author={@user.id}""] <p> {@post_title}, Company: {@post_author,get_company}<br> {@post_author,get_QPMID}</p>[/pods] The where clause gets all the posts I authored (3) and the display code shows what that same id gets from the company and QPMID fields. All are as expected. What it cannot show is the particular combination of {@user.id,get_QPMID} because {@user.id} seems to work only in the where clause . Here is the result: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58439210/80550345-d2e77680-898d-11ea-8c29-58b7ab6a08b1.png) The Joes New Page project was posted by me but credited to Joe as Project Creator, thus its inclusion in this where clause result. ## Current Behavior No posts are listed when using the shortcode **[pods name=project template=MyProjects where = ""project_creator.QPMID.meta_value={@user.id,get_QPMID}""]** Since checking the QPMID.meta_value already worked inside the where clause, the problem seems to be passing the user id to the function. This is confirmed by using the literal test again, but this time with user id: [pods name=project template=MyProjects where = ""{@user.id,get_QPMID}='654bc438-eee8-409c-b855-b15500764116'""] This shortcode returned no posts. ## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs) <!-- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to --> <!-- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant --> 1.Use the code snippet above to get a user meta field of your choice by changing the $key from 'QPMID' to your field name.

After some tracking, I was able to come up the code (listed below) to demonstrate the bug. In short, SkyOffsetFrame is implemented as a factory, which means classes like SkyOffsetFrameICRS, SkyOffsetFrameAltAz, etc. are created on the fly. One issue with this is that both these classes have a CoordinateAttribute named origin, and this is registered into the global frame_transform_graph (an instance of TransformGraph) though the frame_attrs_from_set convenient function, which does an iterative dict update according to the classes listed in frame_transform_graph.frame_set. When both SkyOffsetFrameICRS and SkyOffsetFrameAltaz are present in this set, the order of dict update is undetermined. As a consequence, the frame_transform_graph.frame_attributes sometimes contain origin object from the former, sometimes the latter. ### Expected behavior <!-- What did you expect to happen. --> ### Actual behavior <!-- What actually happened. --> <!-- Was the output confusing or poorly described? --> ### Steps to Reproduce <!-- Ideally a code example could be provided so we can run it ourselves. --> <!-- If you are pasting code, use triple backticks () around your code snippet. --> <!-- If necessary, sanitize your screen output to be pasted so you do not reveal secrets like tokens and passwords. --> The code that demonstrate the problem:  ### Version info Darwin-19.3.0-x86_64-i386-64bit Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 10 2020, 15:43:33) [Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17)] Numpy 1.18.2 astropy 4.1.dev964+g6ea3035e5) around your code snippet. --> <!-- If necessary, sanitize your screen output to be pasted so you do not reveal secrets like tokens and passwords. --> The code that demonstrate the problem:  ### Version info Darwin-19.3.0-x86_64-i386-64bit Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 10 2020, 15:43:33) [Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17)] Numpy 1.18.2 astropy 4.1.dev964+g6ea3035e5",Can you please post the version info as requested by the bug report template?

mavlink/qgroundcontrol,https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/7471,mavlink_qgroundcontrol_issues_7471,"Camera Manager: Collection of behaviors to imporve

I've made much progress with implementing a CameraManager support into the STorM32 gimbal controller to the point that it is practically usable, and in the practical tests I start to observe various behaviors of the camera manager GUI implementation which - IMHO - could be improved for better user friendliness. Instead of raising an issue for each, I thought I rather collect them here (pl tell if you prefer single issues for each). <strike>**1) Stream Selector field shown even if no STREAM capability** See #7450.</strike> EDIT: resolved **2) In photo mode single shot or interval mode should be indicated.** It's easy to forget what the last setting for the photo mode (single or interval) was, and not remembering it can lead to unexpected behavior. I thus suggest to have a graphical element on the GUI's ""frontpage"" showing this. E..g. this often seen ""multiple-clocks"" graphics. I would suggest to extend this to a ""submode"" concept. Cameras like the GoPro e.g. support several submodes for each video and photo, single or interval would then be seen as submodes. For the same reasons it would be highly useful if the camera's submode would be easily visible to the user. This may cause an issue for submodes for which the GUI/GCS doesn't have a graphics to represent, but this should be solvable, and be it that in this case the GUI doesn't show a graphics. <strike>**3) Don't allow changes of camera mode (photo vs video) while a video is recording or a a photo interval is running.** Currently that's possible, and results in strange states for the red button.</strike> EDIT: done <strike>**4) In photo mode provide a graphical feedback when the next photo can be taken.** In photo mode with single shots the response is very slow, i.e. it takes few seconds before the next photo can be taken. If a hit on the red button was successful currently can only be inferred indirectly through an increasing number of photos. I suggest to provide some graphical mechanism to show to the user when it is ready for the next shot. E.g., the red button could get square, and round again when ready for the next shot.</strike> EDIT: resolved **5) Clarify the behavior and relationship as regards CAM_MODE and CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS.** Depending on the capability flags and the existence of a CAM_MODE parameter various GUI configurations result. However, not all combinations lead to what I would consider the expected configuration and behavior of the GUI. E.g. from the description for the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_MODES flag I would have expected that with CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_VIDEO + CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_IMAGE but no CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_MODES and no CAM_MODE parameter the GUI would still show video and photo modes, which is not the case. <strike>**6) Display available capacity with space between value and unit.** Don't display '5.7GB' but '5.7 GB'. Or even better display '5.71 GB'. Also, values in the MB range are cut to integer, e.g. a value of 7.8xxx is displayed as 7.0MB.</strike> EDIT: done **7) Don't request parameters twice.** Upon connection and startup of the camera manager the parameters are requested twice. It seems once when the component is detected and then a second time when the camera manager starts. **8) Don't give up with requesting CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS during video.** When recording a video is on, QGC requests CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS every 5 secs, but stops with doing so if a response is not received. I suggest to keep on, to allow for responses to be missed every once in a while. **9) Behave gracefully if camera isn't in a ""I'm OK"" state** It can happen that a camera experiences an issue, the GUI should behave gracefully then. The heartbeat's system_status field would be the canonical source of information for this, and the camera GUI should at least to some extend adjust its behavior to that. For instance, the critical/emergency states could be reasonable states for a camera to indicate issues. To give a specific practical example: A camera may miss a SD card or low battery and thus couldn't record, take photos, report memory size, and so on. The camera may then not be able to fill it's mavlink parameters with reasonable values, etc.. **10) Separate GUI for Camera Manager** It is somewhat annoying, and often leads to practical issues, that telemetry and camera can't be seen/accessed simultaneously. It would be highly useful if the camera manager GUI would be it's own GUI element. I mention #7540, which goes along similar lines. **11) Ensure that ""fields"" are consistent on init** It can happen that things are out of sync at init. For instance: I have a camera definition file now which makes use of excludes to select out parameters depending on CAM_MODE being video or photo. The GUI starts with the button in Video, according to the CAM_MODE parameter, but when looking at the parameters those for photo are selected. When I change the mode to photo and back to video, all is OK. This sort of startup inconsistencies I've observed in more instances, but can remember all. **12) Timing of initial param read and camera requests very harsh** Located in extra issue. **Miscellaneous** * when changing from photo to video the displayed available memory is shown as 0, not the actual value Thx for all your work on this, the CameraManager is really super cool.",Could you share your configuration xml file so that we see how you're using it?,6) Display available capacity with space between value and unit. Don't display '5.7GB' but '5.7 GB' 7) Don't request parameters twice Upon connection and startup of the camera manager the parameters are requested twice. It seems once when the component is detected and then a second time when the camera manager starts.

### Environment  I'm using latest openSUSE Tumbleweed for x64 CPU with KDE/Plasma 5 desktop. ### Current behavior Hi, today I found something really weird. In __using__/1 macro I was generating module String. Of course such name is not good and instead of MyLib.String there should be for example MyLib.StringUtils, but name was only temporary. In such generated module I placed function/macro (does not matter), added docs and typespecs. That macro was really short, so I immediately started to work on another part without compiling it. Later I noticed really weird error:  This does not give me any hint, so I was confused for a longer time. Without any idea what's happening I decided for desperate move i.e. comment all of my code part by part and see if something has changed and that's how I found it. :smile: Here is an example code:  Of course that was mainly my bad.

So to summarize three issues here: 1) Spurious error in the logs related to a missing index that is not missing at all, and 2) A faulty execution plan for a graph traversal query resulting in seemingly infinite runtime, and the spurious error already mentioned. 3) Somehow this (or something else?) corrupted the db server, causing the same error even on other queries, until the db server was restarted. __Expected result__: ArangoDB should always be aware of the existing indexes and not suddenly report one as missing.","Can you please update it with more information about your environment, configuration and query?","WITH f, d, s FOR v, e IN 0..100 ANY @id GRAPH g RETURN KEEP(v, '_id', '_key')le: true): WITH f, d, s FOR v, e IN 0..100 ANY @id GRAPH 'c' RETURN KEEP(v, '_id', '_ke % [ _to ] base INBOUND 2 edge edge d_edges false false 99.94 % [ _from ] base OUTBOUND 2 edge edge s_edges false false 34.5 % [ _to ] base INBOUND 2 edge edge s_edges false false 00.00 % [ _from ] base OUTBOUND Functions used: Name Deterministic Cacheable Uses V8 KEEP true true false Traversals on graphs: Id Depth Vertex collections Edge collections Options Filter / Prune Conditions 2 0..100 d, f, s d_edges, s_edges uniqueVertices: none, uniqueEdges: path Optimization rules applied: Id RuleName 1 optimizeWhen here is the plan: , d, s FOR v, e IN 0..100 INBOUND @id GRAPH 'c' RETURN KEEP(v, '_id', '_key') Execution plan: Id NodeType Site Est.

The following 'socket hang up' error occurs on different steps starting on the 8th to 11th scenario in a given feature file, where the previous scenarios, usually with the same sequence of steps as the failing one, run fine. Up until last November, all were running fine and passing, for ~1yr. The subsequent 4 tests also fail with 'socket hang up', while the following few tests will fail with error 'A session id is required for this command but wasn't found in the response payload', and then will start passing again. A new session is started with each scenario, as browser.reload() gets called on starting a scenario. The initial 'socket hang up' error occurs usually 4-5 steps into the scenario, while subsequent ones occur on the first step of the scenario. This is on Chrome, and was working perfectly until ~last November. Similar intermittent 'A session id is required for this command but wasn't found in the response payload' errors had always occurred on IE10 and IE11 (with no 'socket hang up'). Concurrent with the error, a browser window gets opened but doesn't get resized or attempt to navigate to the application url, and stays open while new windows get generated for new scenarios.

"" And the test run fails. ## Environment * Windows 10 or Mac OSX 10.12.6 * WebdriverIO version: 4.10.2 and 4.12.0 * Node.js version: 8.11.2 * Appium version 1.8.1 * WinAppDriver version 1.0 * on Mac using AppiumForMac version beta3 * I see this both in wdio testrunner synchronous and standalone. ## Details I am trying to use webdriverIO with Appium to control native windows and mac applications. On windows I am using WinAppDriver (version 1.0) and on Mac I am using AppiumForMac (beta3) as the OS level drivers. If I use a method like browser.isVisible('~accessibleID') I get a correct ""true"" response. I have also tried this with wdio version 4.12.0 and have the same problem. I am currently using wdio version 4.10.2 due to https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/2624 causing problems for me in gitbash. I have also tried this with numerous versions of Appium from 1.6 up to 1.8.1 and always have this same issue. ## Log files https://gist.github.com/pwarwick/b7a68a895c2d6bab09afa2913edd3686 ## Code To Reproduce Issue Example code that uses windows 10 calculator app as the example var webdriverio = require('webdriverio'); var options = { desiredCapabilities: { platformName: 'Windows', automationName: 'Appium', deviceName: 'WindowsPC', app: 'Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App' }, host: 'localhost', // localhost port: 4723 // port for appium }; var client = webdriverio.remote(options); describe('Simple cases', function () { this.timeout(300000); before(function () { return client.init(); }); describe(""Test native App"", function () { it(""test-function"", function () { return client.click('~NavButton') .then(()=> {return client.pause(2000);}); }); }); after(function() { return client.end(); }); });",Can you please provide Appium logs?,Log files https://gist.github.com/pwarwick/b7a68a895c2d6bab09afa2913edd3686 ##

I haven't been able to reproduce this in the demo account yet, so I don't know if it's been fixed in v8.4?

The second parameter of the | Attribute filter appears to be ignored entirely. ### Steps to Reproduce (example 1) 1. Create a Global Attribute, with field type Attribute. Specify Person as the entity type. For this example, I used ""Current Opt in Attribute"" as the name. 1. Edit the value - it's essentially an attribute picker. Choose ""Currently An eRA"" or another attribute with spaces in the name. Save 1. Run the following Lava:  This returns ""Currently An eRA"" (the name) rather than ""CurrentlyAneRA"" (the key, as requested) Likewise,  returns ""Currently An eRA"" ### Steps to Reproduce (example 2) 1. Create a Person Attribute, with field type Attribute. Specify Person as the entity type. For this example, I used ""Favorite Attribute"" as the name. Assign it to a category, such as ""Membership"" 1. Visit a person's profile and on the Extended Attributes tab, edit Favorite Attribute by selecting ""Baptized Here"" or another attribute with spaces in the name. Save. 1. On their profile page, provide a block with the following Lava:  This returns rather than the Key (BaptizedHere) or the object properties enumerated in JSON. ### Additional notes: Other attributes, when provided with a bad value for the second attribute filter parameter, will return an empty string. For instance, assume you created a Person type Global attribute: {{ 'Global' | Attribute:'SeniorPastor','NotAValidProperty' }} returns """".

I have noticed that audio playback is sometimes glitching in a WindowsDX mode. It seems that GC is blocking XAudio2 thread. Which is a problem, if there is any audio playing during level loading or screen transitions when a new content is being loaded and a new objects are being created. I have narrowed the problem down to SharpDX wrapper. I have also tried the new [Vortice](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows) wrapper, but it also glitches. Both are using [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools) so this may be the source of the issue. I couldn't test this more as I can't get SharpGenTools to run under VS2019. I did create a simple custom wrapper that shows XAudio2 can run with managed wrapper without being affected by GC. The source for all tests is here: https://github.com/Jure-BB/XAudio2_GlitchTest What would be the preferred way to fix this issue in MonoGame? Fixing the discontinued SharpDX or fixing and the new Vortice wrapper and replacing SharpDX in MG or creating a custom wrapper just for the specific XAudio2 features that MonoGame needs? UPDATE: This is caused because MG/SharpDX registers for callbacks in XAudio engine. Check [this post](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/issues/7000#issuecomment-578434940) for details.",Where are the issues?

emberjs/data,https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/5506,emberjs_data_issues_5506,"Waiting for Model.hasMany('relationship').value() to not be null

Hey Ember Data folks, Currently on Ember 2.17 and I'm running into an issue where I've made a call using Ember Data to fetch a model with an include for relationships. For example, if I had a model Employee with a relationship hasMany to other employees in a property called directReports and using the data method to cache relationships  Then when I try to access the direct reports relationship through reference  It's null, which I think is weird because the relationship should have already been included in the response for the query above. I'm suspecting because the relation models are loaded asynchronously even if they have been side loaded with an include. However, if I do something like create a delayed function and set it for something like 200ms later, then employee.hasMany('directReports').value() will return the directReports. However, at that point my route's model hook would have already resolved. Another option I tried was to use  But this seems to make an additional api call. My question has two parts: 1. Should the reference really need to be loading if it was already included in the api response that returned the query for the employee 2. Is there a way to wait for the reference to stop loading and get the value in some kind of promise without using .load() since that seems to make an additional api request?",Why not await employee.get('directReports') ?,"I'm suspecting because the relation models are loaded asynchronously even if they have been side loaded with an include.

mawww/kakoune,https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/2777,mawww_kakoune_issues_2777,"[Feature Request] Add conditional control statements to kakscript

I think some more control statments should be added to kakscript. In particular, I see a use case for conditionals, such as if; elif; else. This isn't terribly important, but I think it would be useful. #### Rationale In some pluggins I have seen, there are shell expansions solely for the purpose of a conditional operation, which is a performance drop over a native kakscript if statement. For operations that are run infrequently (which are most), the performance cost of calling the shell isn't a problem. But for some things, such as RawKey hooks, there is a noticeable performance impact if shell expansions are involved. ##### Admissions I'll admit, many things in in kakscript won't need native conditional logic, since they'll be calling the shell anyway for some other purpose. That, and the performance impact is small enough (order of 1ms) that in most situations this is a non-issue. But for situations where conditional logic is all that is needed -- such as settings in plugins -- it seems like a waste to call the shell just for that. #### Proposal Add bash-style conditional statments as kakscript commands: if, then, elif, else, and fi. Each would accept one argument (except fi accepts no args): if and elif would accept an expansion that evaluates to true or false. then and else would accept an expansion of commands to evaluate. if and elif would do nothing if true (allowing the following then statement to execute), and if false raise a flag that the next then statement would do nothing. This skip_then flag would be set by if/elif, and reset by then. Another skip_conditional flag would be set by if/elif, and if true would cause any elif, then, or else statment to do nothing. This would be reset by the fi statment.",How noticable in the performance impact of using a shell on RawKey hooks? Is it in ms? tens of ms? or even hundreds?,"##### Admissions e.

xbmc/xbmc,https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/14833,xbmc_xbmc_issues_14833,"Power Save display sleep (no signal) does not work if screensaver is also used, it used to work.

## Bug report ### Describe the bug First goto settings / interface / screensaver / set screensaver mode dim, wait time 1 minute. Next go to settings / system / power saving / set put display to sleep when idle, set to 5 minutes. ## Expected Behavior The screensaver should dim at 1minute, then at 5 minutes the display should go into ""no signal mode"" allowing the tv to power off according to your tv ""no signal"" settings (mine is set to turn off after 15 minutes of no signal.) ## Actual Behavior The screen does not go into ""no signal mode"" at the 5 minute mark, instead it goes blank for a second, like it tried, but then goes back to the dim screensaver, and stays on indefinitely. ## Possible Fix Currently if you set Screensaver to ""none"" instead of dim, the power saving feature will work. So I believe the Screensaver may be the culprit. Furthermore this worked properly under Kodi 17. ### Your Environment Used Operating system: - Linux, Ubuntu 18.04 with Kde Plasma - Kodi version: 18 beta5 / latest ### Debug log [https://paste.kodi.tv/zuxahinoni.kodi](https://paste.kodi.tv/zuxahinoni.kodi)",Why did you remove the debug log part from the issue template?

PDAL/PDAL,https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2545,PDAL_PDAL_issues_2545,"Interpolating points to grid with writers.gdal IDW produced unexpected results

While using writers.gdal to interpolate a raster from four points, we encountered some unexpected behaviour. Together, these issues cause IDW in writers.gdal to function very differently to IDW implemented in other geospatial software (e.g. ArcGIS, QGIS, Surfer). 1. Values were only returned for cells in columns or rows containing at least one point, resulting in holes in the raster. We expected a continuous surface across the entire area, bounded by Xmax/Xmin and Ymax/Ymin. This behaviour appears to be independent of the radius argument, as this parameter was set much higher (~10) than the actual distance between points (~1). This issue probably only appears when resolution is lower than point spacing. 2. Interpolation only actually happened for cells lying on an intersection of rows or columns containing two or more points. In columns or rows containing a single point, all cells have the exactly the same value as the point. This is not how spatial interpolation should work, and results in artificial striping of the resultant raster. 3. Implementations of IDW normally take a ‘power’ argument, to control the distance weighting. There does not appear to be an argument for power in writers.gdal. This restricts the way in which this points-to-grid function can be employed and tuned to specific applications. _Example output raster, with four point locations shown as black dots._ ![screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25197948/58557512-74ae9280-8216-11e9-89fb-6a71c03225cc.png) _Code used:_ (tested on Windows, PDAL v1.9.0) dtm_pipeline = { ""pipeline"": [ { ""type"": ""readers.text"", ""filename"": input_file, ""skip"": 1, ""spatialreference"": EPSG }, { ""type"": ""writers.gdal"", ""dimension"": ""Z"", ""resolution"": 0.1, ""radius"": 10, ""output_type"": ""idw"", ""gdaldriver"": ""GTiff"", ""filename"": dtm_outfile } ] }",Can you please provide the input file?,.

When using the ""hbm2ddl.auto"" property in a Configuration and then calling Configuration.BuildSessionFactory(), SessionFactoryImpl creates and invokes a SchemaExport. Problem is, any errors/exceptions that come from that SchemaExport execution are ignored by SessionFactoryImpl. There should be a way for them to be exposed to calling code so the application can decide what to do. In fact it seems very _unlikely_ to me that any application that's using auto-update would ever want such errors to be ignored. Perhaps a property on Configuration to at least fail fast if the SchemaExport has anything in its Exceptions property. I can think of more flexible/extensible options, but the ability to make schema update errors a fatal situation would be helpful.

Hello, and sorry if I am filing this in the wrong place. Certum provides Microsoft Authenticode Code Signing certificates (for signing Microsoft Windows executables and installation packages) to open-source developers at a reduced price. As far as I know, this service is the most affordable way for open-source developers to sign their Windows release binaries. As of a few years ago, due to changes in Microsoft Authenticode policies, Certum only issues code signing certificates on hardware tokens (they sell a bundle which includes a token and a certificate which can be activated online). The token seems to be a ACS ACR101 ICC Reader (USB ID 072f:1204). I am trying to get code signing working on Linux, as it is my main development platform and I can perform all aspects of the Windows builds on it, except for code signing. As I understand, the process would be as follows: 1. A PC/SC driver for the token is needed. I see that the [ACSCCID project](http://acsccid.sourceforge.net/) provides a driver for this token; the manufacturer also seems to [provide some open-source drivers for download](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/141/acr101i-simicro-ccid/#downloads). 2. A PC/SC implementation makes the device available to applications using the installed driver. For Linux, that would be pcsclite. 3. OpenSC can talk to the device through the PC/SC daemon, and can export this functionality via an OpenSSL engine. 4. OpenSSL provides the interface for applications wishing to perform cryptographic operations. 5. Finally, the osslsigncode tool [can be used to sign PE files through libp11](https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/issues/34#issuecomment-595688457). (Edit: I have since realized that there are two devices involved, the reader and the card, so the above isn't accurate.) Following the [guide on the wiki](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Quick-Start-with-OpenSC) yields:  and, pkcs11-tool shows:  So, if I understand correctly, the missing link is OpenSC's support for this device.

**Synfig version & platform**: v1.3.13 (Portable) on Win 10 and also found in v1.3.14 (also Portable) that i got from here-> #536 **Issue description**: Note: as far as we can find, this only occurs on unlooped advanced outlines. The looped lines (like from shapes layers) wont have this issue for some reason. (thanks to rodolforg for this finding on this comment -> https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/1401#issuecomment-624841672) To simplify, width points keep glitching out everytime i try to move their positions. How to reproduce: 1. Create an **Unlooped** Advanced Outlines 2. Check ""Show Width Points"" and select the advanced outline layer 3. Try to move its width points' (the center ones) positions Doesn't matter how i do it, whether using mouse-dragging or arrow keys, those points will jump to random positions within their designated line. Though as for the arrow keys one, sometimes it'll nudge properly as they should, but mostly it's the same jumpy glitch thing.

Essentially just make it like 3BLD. This is optimal because pops and parities can very easily ruin an average—not to mention that a world-class solver can lose to a 5-minute solver in the final round all because of a DNF from a slice move. Additionally, big cubes are all about adrenaline, so getting three attempts to get a nice solve is perfect for competitions, and especially for major championships. The luck factor for being a Bo3 shouldn't be problematic since three attempts is plenty to show your skill. I think this is the best way to deal with these issues, because making it an Ao5 would probably take too long for many competitions. If there are any downsides to this, let me know EDIT: Forgot to mention—it should go without saying that cutoffs for these events would be abolished.

I'm using HistoricalRecords with my models and adding fields to excluded_fields. It saves the data as expected in database but while retrieving in model instances, it jumbles up the data i.e. values gets interchanged. Example models --  Now while saving, it saves the data right excluding the mentioned fields (checked the database for respective values) but while performing ChildModel.history.all(), it messes up the order of values and because of that field with foreign key is holding value for other field's values depending on how many fields i have in excluded_fields which leads to exception - - invalid literal for int() with base 10: '<text in field>' if a text field is replacing values - 'ParentModel matching query does not exist' if an integer field is replacing values and not in range of existing values in ParentModel Same is the case with ParentModel.objects.all() and other field values as well for example field1's value gets changed to some other field's value I'm guessing this is because Django Simple History picks the value from database and puts it in model fields in the same order. (Didn't check the source code hence I could be wrong in this) **Context** With the above models when i do ChildModel.objects.first() it returns me following data in queryset  and with ChildModel.history.last()  which is exactly what is expected out of it.

I've created initial implementation for Blackmagic firmware and implemented a basic OpenOCD HLA interface driver for blackmagic probe. On the probe itself, I've extended the remote.c interface with a new class REMOTE_HL_PACKET. It's currently in experimental stage, but seems to pass functional tests: eg. single stepping, flashing, RTOS threads support, openocd built in memory transfer tests.

Fixed by https://github.com/mixonic/ranked-model/pull/160 Waiting for new release superior than v0.4.4 ------------------------ Hello, I'm experiencing an issue when changing the scope and sending to the first position at the same time for 2 rows inside a transaction, and I'm suspecting it's because I'm around MIN_RANK_VALUE. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong of if this is a legitimate bug, here's the information I've gathered so far: ### My situation: #### Table creation: t.bigint :row_order, null: false #### Model  #### All rows with scope_1 = 114  ### What I'm doing: Inside a transaction: - Updating 12459 with scope_2 = 18 and row_order_position = :first - Updating 12462 with scope_2 = 18 and row_order_position = :first #### My Code (renamed):  #### The crash The first update (for id: 12459) seems to go through, but the second one fails here: (And then everything gets rolled back)  ### StackTrace <details> <summary>Click to Reveal StackTrace</summary>  </details> ### Gut feeling: I don't have a good grasp of what the gem is trying to accomplish in that method but, it seems like I'm only getting in that method because: - my first update (for id: 12459) must set row_order to be before element id: 12470 (which has row_order -2147483646), so it must end up being -2147483647 or -2147483648. - But now my second update (for id: 12462) must do the same thing, and would probably need row_order -2147483648 or **below** which is the MIN_RANK_VALUE, which probably triggers the call to rebalance_ranks - current_order does not have the current instance so origin is nil, and we get the crash at the comparison => I feel like the fix might be something along the lines of: - pre-adding the current instance to current_order when the scope is changing at the same time. - adding a check on origin.nil? - casting origin.to_i to get nil => 0, or maybe it should take a higher value than destination then? Not quite sure. Anyways I hope this is clear enough and helpful, let me know if you'd like more information or clarification. Thank you 🙏",Can you try with master and let me know if the issue is fixed for you?,Fixed by https://github.com/mixonic/ranked-model/pull/160 Waiting for new release superior than v0.4.4 ------------------------

<!--- This environment context section helps us quickly review your PR. Please take a minute to fill-out this information. --> ## Environment **Liquibase Version**: 3.8.9 **Liquibase Integration & Version**: gradle, spring boot **Liquibase Extension(s) & Version**: N/A **Database Vendor & Version**: Firebird - 2.5.9 **Operating System Type & Version**: Windows 10 ## Description In our project we are trying to upgrade liquibase from 3.5.5 to 3.8.9. Firebird is used as database and the version is 2.5.9. While liquibase is trying to apply the change sets it fails with error: liquibase.command.CommandExecutionException: liquibase.exception.DatabaseException: liquibase.exception.LockException: liquibase.exception.DatabaseException: Dynamic SQL Error; SQL error code = -607; Invalid command; Specified domain or source column BOOLEAN does not exist [SQLState:42000, ISC error code:335544641] [Failed SQL: (335544641) CREATE TABLE DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK (ID INT NOT NULL, LOCKED BOOLEAN NOT NULL, LOCKGRANTED TIMESTAMP, LOCKEDBY VARCHAR(255), CONSTRAINT PK_DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK PRIMARY KEY (ID))] ## Root cause When we dig down the issue, we found that a new Database class Firebird3Database is added. The shortName of this instance is ""firebird"" which is same with FirebirdDatabase. Now in BooleanType::toDatabaseDataType it is checking whether current database instance is of Firebird3Database, then using BOOLEAN otherwise SMALLINT. This is absolutely correct as Firebird3 supports boolean datatype. But problem is in how liquibase is deciding the current database instance. If we look into the DatabaseFactory it loads all the database classes like: Class<? extends Database>[] classes = ServiceLocator.getInstance().findClasses(Database.class); This will find Firebird3Database and FirebirdDatabase both but this does not guaranty the order. So, in DatabaseFactory::register, it holds only one database instance (if Firebird3Database is found first then Firebird3Database, otherwise FirebirdDatabase) in implementedDatabases as Firebird3Database and FirebirdDatabase both are using same shortName. When liquibase is deciding the database instance from the connection string, it could be Firebird3Database if it is in the implementedDatabases. So, in this case liquibase is sending BOOLEAN though we are using Firebird 2.5.9, and it fails. ## Additional Context Liquibase should use separate shortName for Firebird3Database and FirebirdDatabase so that there could be two instances in implementedDatabases and it should choose Firebird3Database or FirebirdDatabase deciding from the connection string.
