I looked at evaluate_tags, and found that it does this:  Because the 'always' not in tags or 'always' in skip_tags test is wrapped in the 'all' in skip_tags test, it doesn't work as intended. Indeed, if you do --skip-tags all,b, then tasks tagged with [always,b] are **NOT** skipped, as I would expect. However, the all skip-tags is neither documented, nor does --skip-tags all,b make sense from a UI perspective. If I change the code to:  …then it behaves exactly as I would expect. Having ""always""-tagged tasks be skipped based on an ""apply""-ed tag is not helpful behaviour, and is contrary to the documentation (and intuition based on the meaning of ""always"" in general). I have looked for some explanation of the rationale for this change in commit messages etc., but have been unable to find anything. Therefore I think it's clearly a bug, and evaluate_tags() should be changed as described above. <!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->  <!--- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files --> ##### EXPECTED RESULTS <!--- What did you expect to happen when running the steps above? --> The task should have been run. ##### ACTUAL RESULTS <!--- What actually happened?

ansible/ansible,https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67784,ansible_ansible_issues_67784,"cloudflare_dns: TXT idempotency

##### SUMMARY 1. Using solo=true with type=TXT **replaces all other TXT records** for that domain (or APEX) and may break the domain in various ways 2. Using solo=false with type=TXT create **duplicated** TXT records of the same value for the same subdomain (or APEX). But: - A given domain (or subdomain) often has multiple TXT records, and often on the APEX. - Emptying all TXT records is simply unacceptable - Neither is duplicating records (can break many feature, like website verification or SPF which do not deal with or tolerate multiple records) - Ansible cloudflare_dns module finds its very use in managing multiple records situation. ##### ISSUE TYPE - Feature Idea ##### COMPONENT NAME cloudflare_dns ##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Suggestion: If: - solo=true - and type=TXT - and value contains (.+)= ... then uniqueness among the various existing TXT records should be ensured on the basis of such value's prefix. Would work for SPF (v=spf1) and (facebook|google|...)-site-verification= See also #31511","When you talk about duplicates you don't talk about actual duplicate identical TXT records, but rather duplicates on a usage/prefix level?

##### SUMMARY Edit: **resolved**; just wrap the playbook invocation with buildah unshare, like this:  ---- When using rootless buildah and fuse-overlay together, buildah's mount command doesn't function due to a kernel limitation. This completely breaks the connection plugin since mount is the first thing that happens. We have tracked the original issue at buildah's side: https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues/1225, check it out for the technical details. Sadly, buildah devs decided to disable the mount command for such setup which means that buildah conn can't work in that environment. @giuseppe posted a way around the issue by utilizing buildah unshare. I haven't checked whether it would be possible to fix the connection plugin with such approach.

tgstation/tgstation,https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/issues/40115,tgstation_tgstation_issues_40115,"Immortality Talisman can be resold over and over again for credits via cargo

Issue reported from a round on a personal server Reporting client version: 512 Related to #39938, with credit to @Poojawa for initially pointing it out. I simply made this issue to get attention to the problem and provide detailed reproduction steps. The Immortality Talisman, due to its coding that prevents its destruction by any known means, cannot be properly sold via Cargo like other Lavaland artifacts. If sold, you will receive credits as normal, but the next time you call back the Cargo shuttle from CentCom, the Immortality Talisman will be on it, right where you left it, and it can be resold again and again, _ad infinitum_. ### Reproduction Steps: 1. Obtain an Immortality Talisman 2. Return the Immortality Talisman to the station proper 3. Use the Cargo Shuttle Console to request the delivery shuttle from CentCom 4. Wait for the delivery shuttle to arrive 5. Place the Immortality Talisman anywhere inside the delivery shuttle 6. Use the Cargo Shuttle Console to send the delivery shuttle back to CentCom 7. **Correct Behavior:** _Upon the delivery shuttle's arrival at CentCom, the Cargo Shuttle Console's CentCom message field will read as follows: ""+x credits: Recieved 1 minor lava planet artifact"" where X is a 4-5 digit number, likely near 10,000. This amount is added to your current Cargo credits._ 8. Use the Cargo Shuttle Console to request the delivery shuttle from CentCom again 9. Wait for the delivery shuttle to arrive 10. **Problem Behavior:** _When the delivery shuttle arrives, the Immortality Talisman you previously sold off to CentCom is still there. You can repeat steps 6 through 10 unlimitedly for infinite credits._ **Here's a screenshot of an example shipment to CentCom:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27884105/45093307-0523d080-b0e6-11e8-9461-735bef73fe10.png) **Here's what the Cargo Shuttle Console has to say about it after I sent the shipment to them:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27884105/45093458-6cda1b80-b0e6-11e8-8f3b-04fbb1aeb6bf.png) **When I immediately recalled the Cargo shuttle, this is what came back with it:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27884105/45093572-ca6e6800-b0e6-11e8-9ac7-5a78cdf63913.png)",Does anything speak against force deleting sold cargo shuttle objs?,an the the the thethe as follows This amount is added to your current Cargo credits.the the the

Between the sounds cutting out and the client reconnecting the entire screen went black except for a pink ""500"" slightly up and right of center. ## Reproduction: 1. Latejoin as Atmospheric Technician. (It is possible the bug manifested itself here) 2. Create and equip a welding gas mask and engineering scanner goggles from the engineering techfab. 3. Set the engineering scanner goggles to meson mode. 3. Equip atmospherics hardsuit and raise helmet. 4. Exit station through atmospherics airlock after setting ""Atmospherics Air Vent #4"" to off through the airlock air alarm. 5. Notice that space is pitch black. 6. Comment in OOC and find that no one else is having the same experience. 7.

Some time into the round, I think a bit over an hour, after I've leveled my scrubbing skill to legendary, I became a syndicate sleeper agent, and was assigned to assassinate the detective, steal the medal of captaincy, and escape on the shuttle. Shortly after I was antagged, I purchased some gear: an emag, an agent ID, and a chameleon kit. I ran to the showers and, frequently honking the rubber duck inside as I moved around, started to change into my chameleon kit. I fumbled most parts of the kit and they went in and out of inventories and layers of inventories more times than I can count, but eventually I had everything on. After some moving around station, customizing my chameleon kit a bit more and stealing a botany tray and some chemicals, I disguised as the captain and tried to emag the shuttle console to recall the shuttle, but that didn't work. After that, I got back on the janicart, grabbed my janitorial cart once again, undisguised, bought a minibomb and a couple random items (including dart gun) and headed over to escape to catch the shuttle. There, at about 1 hour 30 minutes round time, a nightmare with envy's knife approached me and started slashing at the lights and APCs, then offered me the knife. I toggled my flashlight on and off a few times, and all of a sudden, my flashlight and tablet appeared on the ground beside me. There was no alert about the nightmare trying to take anything off me, and when I tried to pick it back up and put it back into my pockets, it acted like it had just been used inhand, like it was somehow codified as being both in my pocket and in the hand that had just picked it up off the floor. Then my backpack and several items of my clothing (I think my shoes, gloves and hat) just vanished completely. I came to learn later that the clothing items had wound up in the hands of people on the other side of the station, while the minibomb and dart gun teleported directly into the hands of people standing right beside me. The nightmare then proceeded to open fire with my dart gun while a random nearby scientist ran off with the minibomb. With nothing else left to do, I ran into medical and committed suicide with the janicart key. As soon as I died, all of a sudden my clothes popped back onto my body, and I think it was the original clothing I was wearing at the start of the shift - not the chameleon wear - but I'm not sure about that. I never got Envy's knife, and I don't think I was ever struck by it. Update: Based on the comments, I'm pretty sure this was caused by some weird interaction with the push broom. I'm not entirely sure how I pulled it off, and I think it is one of the items that vanished from my inventory (my hands specifically) so I'm not sure how to recreate it.

***Note: The discussion appears to be at a state of everyone agreeing that putting a Changelog tag in the commit is a bad idea. See eg. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/50483#issuecomment-439603594 for an alternative way to put the same information at a correct place.*** ----- ### Issue description It is currently quite hard to know what exactly changes during package bumps when reviewing the commits, be it during a PR review or after-the-fact, when re-reading the commits, as there is often no link to a Changelog file easily accessible. If the Changelog was necessarily present, it'd mean that reviewers could easily go and read it to check whether an update needs backporting (eg. whether it fixes security issues). It'd also make it much easier for people who follow the git history of nixpkgs to figure out what changed in a package update, without having to scout the web for a Changelog. ### Proposed solution Request that every package bump include, in its commit message, Changelog: [url of the changelog], or Changelog: none if upstream doesn't provide a Changelog. This is a policy change, and will likely require quite some time to get all reviewers to check for the presence of the Changelog tag. ### Future work @GrahamcOfBorg can be useful here by adding a check for commits that have -> in their title, checking for a Changelog tag. However, it should not display as a failed check if it's absent, as the “-> in the title” heuristic may catch non-upgrade commits. It may also be possible to, later on, request that people who submit PRs add in a Security fix: [CVE or URL list] or Security fix: none, to make it easier for specifically security fixes. I didn't propose this straight away because it requires potentially more work to figure out, and sometimes the security fixes aren't even known at the time the update is made. Finally, this is part of a long-term plan of mine to revive the “Security fixes from 20xx-xx-xx” series, by making it easier to figure out which commits introduce security fixes. ### Alternatives It would also be possible to request a link to the changelog in a meta.changelog field, but changelogs may change location between versions, so it wouldn't be a good place to put it in if we want automated tools to check that the Changelog link is always up-to-date. On the other hand, requesting it to just always be present in the commit message, even if it is the same Changelog as the previous one, means that there must always be a conscious effort of searching for it. ### Drawbacks It's more burden when bumping a package, as it also requires fetching the Changelog. This could be mitigated by actually adding a meta.changelog item that would hold the link to the Changelog, for packages for which it is known not to change often. What do you think about it?",How the case when the bot does the update and testing — and changelog is always in a different place — should be handled?,***Note: The discussion appears to be at a state of everyone agreeing that putting a Changelog tag in the commit is a bad idea.

NixOS/nixpkgs,https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/41340,NixOS_nixpkgs_issues_41340,"GCC fails because argument list created by nix is too long

### Quick summary * nix blows up number of -L flags passed to GCC * GCC passes all -L flags to its subprogram cc1 via an environment variable * If that's longer than 128 KB, then everything crashes with E2BIG ### Details So once again, I'm building some Haskell with lots of library dependencies. Trying to upgrade this build to 18.03, the nix-build of the Haskell package newly fails with  This error message is wrong (cabal doesn't correctly propagate the argument list too long error shown below; I filed a bug about it being misleading at https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5355); the dependency exists. The problem is that because in some eventual gcc invocation the amount of arguments passed to GCC turns out to be very long. strace confirms:   E2BIG (Argument list too long), in this case because COLLECT_GCC_OPTIONS is longer than 128 KB (32 * 4 KB pages, see [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/120842/100270), and a [repro script I made here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/41340#issuecomment-469026735)). What is the COLLECT_GCC_OPTIONS environment variable? [It is](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2013-05/msg00093.html) an environment variable set by gcc before calling out to cc1, over which it communicates flags to cc1. Most (if not all?) flags given to gcc will make it into this variable. So it can grow very big (easily larger than the 128 KB limit, especially on nix). Note that even flags given in a ""response file"" via gcc @myresponsefile.rsp (which was designed to pass GCC flags via a file instead of command line args to circumvent command line arg limits) will be put into COLLECT_GCC_OPTIONS by gcc itself to communicate them to cc1 (I have just confirmed that with a small example on my Ubuntu 16.04). So using @myresponsefile.rsp is _not_ a workaround. (Yes, this seems to defeat the purpose of response files, but I suspect those were originally made to circumvent a much smaller limit of command line argument on Windows, where the limit is well below the 128 KB limit for environment variable lengths on Linux). --- Aside: nix inflates the number of -L flags by the fact that each -L option to gcc is present multiple times, but those duplicates make only for factor 4x or so; even if they were deduplicated, I'd already be at half of [MAX_ARG_STRLEN](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/120642/what-defines-the-maximum-size-for-a-command-single-argument/120842#120842) with my medium-size Haskell project; so if I added a couple more dependencies to my Haskell project (all _recursive_ nix Haskell dependencies make it as -L options into the gcc command line), I'd quickly exceed that limit again even without duplication. --- ### Problems to fix 1. Deduplicating the -L flags passed to GCC will help the issue by a small constant factor and make a couple more projects compile, but won't help with projects with many dependencies. 2. The fundamental issue seems to be a GCC problem (its way of passing arbitrarily sized information via environment variables to a direct child program doesn't work), so technically it's not nix's department. But we need to do something about it, because otherwise we can't build large Haskell projects (on nix or otherwise). ### Steps to reproduce * Build a Haskell project with lots of dependencies on nixpkgs 18.03. * **update:** and lots of native C dependencies, and lots of executable sections in the cabal file, see [comment](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/41340#issuecomment-393887066) below ## Environment * on top of nixpkgs commit a0b977bdb461a756047adb1dcbb70d7c106507da; tested on both NixOS and Ubuntu 16.04",How many dependencies are we talking here?

## Issue description The AVX512 kernel on SKYLAKE-X CPUs seems to have a bug that produces wrong numbers (see https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2061). I ran into the bug when I tried to use CP2K (external derivation https://github.com/markuskowa/NixOS-QChem/tree/master/cp2k). Seems also to affect julia (https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/1955). ~~Unfortunately there is no simple solution available:~~ * ~~https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2061 turns off the problematic kernel but then even the unit tests in CP2K fail (which passed before) leaving openblas in a even more broken state.~~ * ~~Alternatively the problem could be solved by turning off DYANAMIC_ARCH but then compilation fails with TARGET=""ATHLON"". TARGET=""NEHALEM"" or TARGET=""HASWELL"" seems to work but this might break openblas on older system (> ~8-10 years old)~~. * ~~Waiting for openblas 0.3.6 might be the best option (?)~~ The problem can be solved by setting NO_AVX512 in the make flags. Using the DYANAMIC_ARCH feature has another unwanted side effect on some SKYLAKE CPUs. Heavy utilization of AVX512 instructions can lead to a drastic reduction in CPU clock frequency. On models like the Xeon Scalable Silver which have only one AVX512 unit per core (e.g. 2.2 GHz -> 1.4 GHz), this can lead to significantly slower code. For example a 20 core linpack benchmark (HPL) on a dual CPU Xeon Silver 4114 system yields **400 GFlops with AVX512 turned on** and **570 GFlops with AVX512 disabled** (use AVX2 instead). Note that MKL has a similar problem (https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-math-kernel-library/topic/776894). ### Steps to reproduce * Use dgemm function on a Skylake series CPUs (?) ## Technical details * openblas 0.3.5 * affects NixOS 19.03 and nixpkgs-unstable CC @costrouc @dtzWill @ttuegel @vcunat",Would this break AMD systems?,~~~~~~.~~~~~~~~~~ The problem can be solved by setting NO_AVX512 in the make flags.

Indeed, if I'm logged into Habitica I get a LOT of activity in the fans and a LOT of CPU use, plus the Habitica web content process takes about a gig of memory. I find nothing on your GitHub page on this, and nothing on the Trello suggestions. Known bug, or just me?"" From Habitica login to getting the Safari error took about 18 minutes and produced the Java console errors below. CPU for the Safari Web Content process for Habitica peaked at 151% (of 4GHz Intel Core i7 4-core processor) and averaged about 87% ONLY when the Habitica browser tab was the active one AND displaying Tasks. Memory consumption of that process runs about 650–750 MB (of 32GB)—it does not seem to be a memory leak (just saying, because I get a similar CPU problem logged into Gmail, but in addition to keeping the fans busy Gmail steadily hogs all available RAM until it crashes my computer after a day or so). For the Java console error test (below) I first disabled all Safari plugins and extensions, and turned Little Snitch off. Then I did very little, just switched Habitica pages a few times and watched the CPU load and fan activity increase until Safari complained (Alys said to copy Java console contents at that point, but after login nothing produced any more console feedback). In Safari, JavaScript is enabled, pop-up windows are not blocked. Cookies are enabled, website tracking is set to defaults (prevent cross-site tracking and ask sites not to track). I have not changed any Safari settings since long before this problem began—but I don't know what Apple may have done to Safari in their frequent updates… I had a webhook setup in Habitica to attempt integration with Trello via a Zapier app a long time ago, but it is shown as not enabled in Habitica settings (it never worked well anyway). Besides, this problem is relatively recent. I don't know whether I'll get notifications from GitHub or not (will check my settings after posting this), so if you need more info to figure this out and you get no response from me, shoot me an email to dzturbd@gmail.com Cheers! #### Console Errors [//]: # (Include any JavaScript console errors here.)

This makes it almost impossible to have a module that works in both Node.js and the browser, but has some added capabilities in Node.js. Note that this is about authoring reusable npm packages, not end-user apps.

Prior discussion that went mostly ignored by the Webpack team: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/196#issuecomment-354900072 **What is the expected behavior?** I expected to be able to annotate the code to make Webpack ignore certain require() calls. For example with a comment:  I know for certain that this require() call will not be used in the browser, so I should be able to have it in my source code without Webpack printing warnings to users or erroring out.

webpack/webpack,https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10352,webpack_webpack_issues_10352,"Merge Proposal: Module federation and code sharing between bundles. Many builds act as one

<!-- Please don't delete this template or we'll close your issue --> This is a proposal to merge my existing work into the Webpack core. The base concept is federated application orchestration at runtime. What I hope will provide a new era for how we build apps at scale. **Due to the demand for more information, we have created a site that consolidates all content** https://federated-libraries-next.now.sh/ https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/guides/module-federation.md ## Feature request @sokra as requested, I've opened a new issue for us to discuss planning and implementation. This is the evolution of my original issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8524 edit: a better way to explain the request. I want the webpack equivalent of Apollos federation concept. I want to share resources between separate bundles at runtime. Similar to DLL plugin but without needing to provide Static build context , and I want to do this at runtime in the browser. Not at build time. Thus enabling tech like micro-frontends to be efficient, easy to manage, and most importantly - erase page reloads between separate apps and Enable independent deploys of standalone applications. For context, I've already implemented this feature request with great success. I feel this would have a major impact on frontend applications. I am proposing to refactor/rewrite my project and introduce it into the Webpack core. https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-external-import **What is the expected behavior?** import('website-one/MegaNav') require('website-one/MegaNav') - I expect to be able to require modules or chunks from other Webpack bundles hosted elsewhere. - I don't want to manage externals and worry about synchronizing them across systems - I don't want a single point of failure, like a commons chunk - I want to load code from another build, like dynamic imports and code-splitting - I want multiple builds to look and feel like a monolith in the client - I am able to deploy frontend apps independently and expect Webpack to orchestrate at runtime - I don't want to use less integrated/framework oriented solutions like SingleSPA, browser events, service workers - I want to use Webpack as the host container for foreign chunks and modules, not load other app entry points, but rather load other apps *chunks* and use those modules - If desired, an entire company should be able to federate code across every UI, from user-facing to backend. Effectively turning a multi build, multi team, multi mono-repo company into one SPA in the browser. Removing the need for page reloads or downloading additional code and bundles containing mostly the same node modules **What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?** This would offer a major shift in frontend architecture. Apps are getting larger and code-splitting on its own is not as effective with things such as micro-frontend technology. All current solutions on the market are substandard - working around the problem instead of addressing it. Application interleaving at runtime enables many new avenues for engineering. Heres some: - Applications can be self-healing, in the event there is a network failure - one could query other interleaved apps and load their copy of the missing dependency. This would solve deploy issues where pages break for a moment as the new code replaced old - Code can be distributed and managed by the team maintaining it, with options for evergreen code. Navigation, Pages, Routers - could be managed and deployed by the team who owns it - others would not have to redeploy their applications to get updates - Smaller bundles - interleaved apps wouldn't download chunks if Webpack already has the modules required by the interleaved app or fragment. - Easy and feasible micro-frontends - the tech right now involves some serious management and time to build supporting infrastructure - Shareable configs - interleave FE configurations without the need to rebundle or expose multiple configs. - Avoid long & slow builds due to the size of the monorepo. This would enable smaller builds and faster deploys with less coordination across teams - Introduction of ""micro-service functions"" modeling something similar to what backend engineers get to enjoy. - Better AB testing and marketing tooling. Right now AB tests are managed via a tag manager, plastering vanilla JS onto the dom which is usually not optimized, pollifilled, or compatible with how much javascript apps are written today. Markering teams and AB teams would write native components without having to get in the way of team delivery. - Better analytics - Tag managers and analytics engineers could write system native modules that could be woven into codebases. Most depend on some plugin or just reading the DOM. Interleaving would open a new world of slick integration. - third party modules - vendors could take advantage of this tech and offer managed modules instead of inefficient scripts - they'd still be secure but would have a new way of implementation. Iframes could be avoided in some cases - no global pollution of the window, globals can be accessed via the Webpack runtime - as more apps are interleaved, they too can supply their modules to another interleaved app, resulting in less and less code needing to be downloaded as more and more modules are added to webpack The use cases are limitless, I've only begun to imagine possibilities. Webpack is more than capable of doing this without needing any big changes to the core. Both 4 and 5 already have what I need. **How should this be implemented in your opinion?** Seeing as I've already done it. I have a clear picture of how to implement it. However, it can be improved with some guidance. I hold little opinion over the solution, as long as it offers a similar outcome. 1. Add an additional require extension which can support interleaving. I'm currently using a slightly modified version of requireEnsure which already works very well with Webpacks chunk and module loading / caching. when requiring an interleaved module - users would specify a pattern like <namespace>/<module.id> - Because my current solution is based on requireEnsure, it's pretty robust and not hacky. To handle CSS I've also taken the code template from mini-css to support side-effect loading. 2. Output an unhashed JS file that can be embedded onto other apps. This file would contain a small mapping of chunk.id to the cache busted file name. 3. Hashed module ids based on contents + package.json version of dependency + usedExports to support tree-shaken code. Hashing needs to be effective at avoiding collisions as well as to support tree-shaken code. Hashing enables effective code sharing and prevents overwriting existing modules. Ideally, if there's an option to update module id after optimization - it would likely improve the reliability of hashing. However, I have not encountered any problems. Open to alternative solutions. This hashing mechanism I am using is used by amazon who built a CLI to orchestrate code sharing across the company. 4. A slight addition to the chunk template to include some registration data or another function similar to webpackJsonp.push which registers chunks and provides some metadata to Webpack Heres what it would include: - compilation hash: to detect if this chunk is being loaded by the build that created it, if so, no additional processing is needed - an array of additional chunk.id's required by the current chunk - a list of module ids which allow Webpack to determine if it has all modules required by the chunk about to be interleaved. Webpack would use a lazy find to search modules for the first instance of a missing module.id. At which point Webpack would load the extra chunk needed to fulfill any missing modules it does not already have 5. an interface similar to externals, where a developer can specify what files/modules they intend to make available for interleaving. During the build, Webpack would not hash these module.ids, but instead, make the id be whatever the key is. Allowing humans to call the module by a predictable name. All dependencies of a module and all modules, in general, would be hashed - ensuring that nested dependencies can be tree shaken and will only use existing modules in Webpack if they are an exact match. 6. Some automatic chunk splitting which would ensure interleaved files are placed into their own cache group. I also recommend chunking vendor bundles and any loader JS code out of the main chunk in order to avoid interleaving the entry point because of something like css-loader getting grouped into the main chunk. In order to prevent downloading a massive 200kb chunk, I am suggesting that there be some default limit for maxSize set on cache groups. Something along the lines of enabling aggressive code-splitting by default if interleaving is enabled. The goal is a happy medium between not downloading dozens of chunks and not downloading a massive chunk for one or two modules the host build cannot supply.   Which would be used in consumer apps like this: require.interleaved('website-one/TitleComponeent') For better understanding, I suggest reading the links below. Please note that I am aware of many of the less elegant parts of the codebase and eager to improve the implementation to meet internal standards of Webpack (perf, bundle size, implementation strategy, better hooks to use) - https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-external-import - https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-external-import/blob/master/src/webpack/interleaveFn.js - https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-external-import/blob/master/src/webpack/chunkSplitting.js - https://github.com/ScriptedAlchemy/webpack-external-import/blob/master/src/webpack/optimizeChunk.js **Are you willing to work on this yourself?** yes - I have been contributing to Webpack since v1 and have a deep understanding of its API. I'd like to be the one to bring this feature to the wider JS community as well as to Webpack. I've built multiple large scale MFEs, some consisting of over 100 MFE's at one company. I am very familiar with the challenges and alternative methods to chunk federation/interleaving - all of them are terrible. While this solution might not be for everyone, it will have major value to massive corporations consisting of hundreds of teams of FE stacks. I am also able to test implementation updates against my own userbase - providing additional assurance to Webpack. I used the same approach when merging extract-css-chunks with mini-css (bringing HMR to mini-css) **Current results** I've been using this system for AB tests, Next.js apps, and config sharing at scale. In a simple comparison. Interleaving three separate React apps produced only 320kb of code transferred (1.2mb uncompressed) compared to 4mb using traditional solutions available on the market. **Extra considerations** - Whitelisting instructions that would enable developers to tell Webpack to use the ""host build's"" version of a dependency. Cases like React where I can't have two on the page - I want to offer the option to have a chunk use the version already installed, even if its a patch version different. - Hashing bloats builds: I'm looking for an alternative solution to hashing to give the community options, however, the savings of code sharing drastically outweigh any overhead in my opinion. 4mb to 1.2mb speaks for itself. - Chunk manifests are inside the chunk - this could be in one single file to produce a single manifest, however, I like the idea of code splitting chunk needs into the chunk themselves. This would make the actual manifest file very small as all it looks up is chunk names to URL paths. Seeing as the manifest is either cache busted with Date.now or 304 cache control - I wanted to keep it lean in the event developers don't want to deal with cache headers and just cache bust the 2kb file on each page load. This would introduce one extra loading wave, as once the chunk is downloaded, it would specify what it needs, triggering Webpack to then download any additional files in one call. Download chunk->download any chunks containing modules Webpack host build cannot provide. Nested chunks would not create more loading waves as the chunk metadata contains a thorough map of what it needs in totality **SSR** Update: because this is **not only a browser implementation** - you are more than able to federate modules via common js and shared directory or volumes on s3 or some other store that system. Alternatively, one could npm install a node version of the dependency at CI, treating the federated code (which is bundled so there’s no need for nested npm installs) to install the latest copy at deploy rendering most recent deploy of it - but at runtime the most updated Versions are available. Ultimately- if you use module federation for the node build and were to have a shared disk that a lambda could read from, you’d be able to require other code deployed, in the exact same manner as you do on the frontend.",Did I miss something? Would you consider these requirements as full-filling for your use cases?,. The base concept is federated application orchestration at runtime. What I hope will provide a new era for how we build apps at scale.

### Summary In #5499 a bug was fixed which caused security-related headers to not appear in HTTP response if that response was commited during INCLUDE dispatch. The solution was to wrap both HttpServletRequest and RequestDispatcher object in order to intercept RequestDispatcher::include call. That fix doesn't work if RequestDispatcher is obtained via some other means than HttpServletRequest::getRequestDispatcher method. In my particular case it's the SiteMesh 2.x servlet filter that obtains dispatcher via ServletContext::getRequestDispatcher and then calls include method on it. The returned dispatcher is unfortunately not a wrapper created by HeaderWriterFilter which means that no security headers are added to HTTP response. ### Actual Behavior Assuming that security-related headers are enabled in spring-security: 1. HeaderWriterFilter is invoked and both request and response objects are wrapped. 2. After that some 3rd party library calls RequestDispatcher::include on dispatcher obtained via some other means than HttpServletRequest::getRequestDispatcher method. 3. Response is flushed during that INCLUDE dispatch call. This results in security-related headers not being added to HTTP response. ### Expected Behavior The way of obtaining RequestDispatcher object should not be a factor when adding security-related headers to response. ### Configuration Tomcat 8.5.34 SiteMesh 2.4.2 Spring-based web application which uses JSPs and decorates them using SiteMesh. ### Version 5.1.2 ### Sample [spring-security-gh6414.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/files/2751809/spring-security-gh6414.zip) Attached is a Zip file containing a simple Spring Boot application.

The same doesn't happen on Chrome on PC or Android.

It should get set at ""relayEvent_"", but it only gets called after a pointermove event. It seems on IOS Safari ""handleTouchMove_"" gets called before the listener that fires ""relayEvent_"", and thus ""originalPointerMoveEvent_"" is still undefined. ""handleTouchMove_"" does get called later, it's just the initial call that crashes the app. Thus adding a null check before using ""originalPointerMoveEvent_"" at this line could be enough to fix the issue https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/commit/88b8b2f7cb95fe6c728767dc5d1194bc04139b60?diff=unified#diff-0833750a228e1622e02bcc1779738e7aR278 **UPDATE:** Here's what I figured was the issue with https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/88b8b2f7cb95fe6c728767dc5d1194bc04139b60/src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js#L278: In some environments (such as iOS 12), this handler gets called before the related relayEvent_.

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oldschoolmtg/comments/9ts28f/best_place_to_play_old_school_magic_online/)), I would like to look into solutions to implementing Chaos Orb. My suggestions are the following: - If old school is selected during game creation, allow the creator to set a fixed percentage accuracy for chaos orb flips. I assume many players will use video conferencing and perform a physical flip when required during game play. - Therefore, if accuracy is disabled, instead a dialog will be displayed on chaos orbs abilities resolution, allowing the player to confirm or reject the effect based on the physical flip.

BoltCMS 3.6 will break once people update their PHP version to 7.1.28 because of changes in the intl extension between PHP 7.1.27 and 7.1.28. Details ------- | Question | Answer |----------------- | ------ | Relevant Bolt Version | legacy / 3.5 / 3.6 / master | Install type | Zip or tar install / Composer install / GitHub checkout | BC Break | no | PHP version | 7.1 | Web server | Nginx / CLI | For UX/UI issues | not relevant Reproduction ------------ If you're filing a bug, please describe how to reproduce it. Include as much relevant information as possible, such as: ### Bug summary The php-intl extension version 7.1.28 returns an empty array when using locale_parse('root') whereas php-intl version 7.1.27 returns an array with the key language and value 'root'. We run Ubuntu 18.04 with Ondřej Surý's PHP repository, which just updated from PHP 7.1.27 to PHP 7.1.28, which causes this issue. ### Specifics Updating php-intl causes a change in the data returned from locale_compose(), which causes Symfony 2.8's Symfony\Component\Intl\Locale::getFallback('root') to return an empty array. This in turn causes Symfony\Component\Intl\Data\Bundle\Reader::readEntry to never exit the while loop. Finally, this in turn causes Bolt to not load it's web interface anymore (both frontend and backend) but instead fill up all memory available to PHP , and subsequently exit with an internal server error. Also composer install when running PHP 7.1.28 will hang until the memory is eaten up and then throw an out of memory exception. The underlying issue is explained more in-depth here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/31089 ### Steps to reproduce Run the following command on PHP 7.1.27 that has php-intl installed: $ php -r ""var_dump(locale_parse('root'));"" See the output is:  Now run the same on PHP 7.1.28 with php-intl installed: $ php -r ""var_dump(locale_parse('root'));"" See the output is:  ### Expected result I would suspect php-intl does the same thing between patch versions but apparently not... ### Actual result As explained above ### The workaround we applied to have a working BoltCMS: We traced https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/31089#issuecomment-482542636 and found the change is not in Location.php as suggested, but in Locale.php: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/30781/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.php We then copied over Symfony's Locale.php to a different location in our project (we chose src/SymfonyOverrides), applied the patch from the PR above, and added this Locale.php to Composer's autoload:  _Update: my colleague @StevendeVries found that we must exclude the original Locale.php to prevent having two classes with the same class name, which is [not supported by Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/5849#issuecomment-258768647)._ This effectively applies the patch from the PR to Symfony 2.8, so all is good again.

In macvim in a buffer of C code with a many lines and warnings/errors, scrolling stutters, i.e. on scrolling from time to time it slows down for a while 1) create a big file named 'long_file.c' (which will give many warnings) with the following python script:  2) open latter file in macvim with the command: 3) start scrolling or delete a line with 'x' in normal mode and it significantly stutters. Note that for large files even if there are no many error/warnings deleting with 'x' in normal mode stutters. E.g. use the following python script to generate a c file, open it with vim and try to delete the line 'int b=3; b=a+1 [...]' with 'x' in normal mode:  if I disable YouCompleteMe scrolling of 'long_file.c' (or deleting characters with 'x' in normal mode) is smooth.With YouComplete disabled, if I use ALE (https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) with clang linter, scrolling is also smooth as expected. Similarly with YouCompleteMe disable, if I use deoplete and I delete a line in normal mode with 'x', there is no stuttering/lag . I also exploited vim built-in profile capabilities to obtain the following: FUNCTIONS SORTED ON SELF TIME count total (s) self (s) function 523 0.623111 0.589660 <SNR>68_OnCursorMovedNormalMode() 3024 0.104882 ObsessionStatus() 523 0.098218 <SNR>50_Highlight_Matching_Pair() 2016 0.100606 0.077198 gutentags#inprogress() 523 0.028446 0.025770 <SNR>68_AllowedToCompleteInBuffer() 3024 0.129015 0.024133 Obstat() 2016 0.023408 gutentags#find_job_index_by_tags_file() 2016 0.122254 0.021648 gutentags#statusline() 1008 0.016041 lightline#link() 2016 0.133758 0.011504 GThelper() 523 0.033451 0.005005 <SNR>68_AllowedToCompleteInCurrentBuffer() 523 0.004786 lightline#update_once() 1008 0.004608 lightline#mode() 523 0.002676 <SNR>68_DisableOnLargeFile() * What did you expect to happen? * What actually happened? # Diagnostic data ## Output of vim --version VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1 (2018 May 18, compiled Jul 28 2019 01:07:30) macOS version Included patches: 1-1722 Compiled by travis@Traviss-Mac.local Huge version with MacVim GUI.

In the xlf translation file there are two trans-units that have the same source for translation and need to be translated to different words in my language (grammatical gender related). However, they have unique ids, and I was hoping Weblate would distinguish between them based on that. But when I use the file in Weblate I can translate only one of this trans-units, the other doesn't even appear among the strings. So it seems that Weblate doesn't use the id attribute in the trans-unit. Is there any other way to tell trans-units with the same source apart.

In order to stub the email server, I'm using [fakesmtp](http://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/) so I can see the emails that are sent. At a point I clicked by mistake on Manage > Addons on a component, but the thing is I don't have the VCS locally when checking the upgrade, so of course I got an error about a missing property file. Now the problem is that I got the notification emails for this error in fakesmtp, and it appears that it has not only be sent to the manager / admin, but also to users watching the project and being active (if I understand well). So, now I'm wondering: would that be the case for any error happening when managing a component?

Sorry again to bother you with setup, but hard to work without the proper tools :-/ I'm working with PyCharm, and I'm apparently unable to properly use the debugger with it. The issue is that PyCharm keeps showing me an error because of celery.py doing an import on celery: I only get the error in the IDE if I specify weblate/weblate as source directory. If I don't specify the source directory, I don't get any error in the IDE and I can run the unit tests. But I cannot run the server and use the debugger: it looks like the debugger is not inspecting the breakpoints: whatever breakpoint I put, each time I start the debugger they are not triggered. (I used https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/08/develop-django-under-the-debugger/ to check) So maybe I'm doing it all wrong, but it would be really useful for me if I could have a live debugger when performing operation on the server, to better understand how it currently works :)",What doesn't work with weblate as source dir?,<bountysource-plugin> --- Want to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/85543583-contribution-onboarding-debugging-weblate-with-pycharm?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github). </bountysource-plugin>

Good evening. I would like to request certain upgrades and additions to the string length rendering checks: **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** I find two problems when it comes to check the renderings: - I'm using the tool to translate the dialogues of a game. Imagine you're using control codes within your dialogues. Just as they can be marked for references, can certain string combos/control codes be marked to have specific widths, from zero (In the case of, for example, color control codes) to a fixed width (For example, variables that draw names). - ~~Call me micromanager, but sometimes I'd like to see the actual sample of the rendered dialogue. Maybe I have a word that's too long and that's going over the limit because of that reason, but I won't be able to know it's the problem unless I actually see the rendered sample. Or maybe I'd like to do the line breaks manually to improve the text flow. Is there a way to display the sample renders to the user?~~ **Describe the solution you'd like** - Add support for a table of custom lengths for specific control codes or words/partial words. Those lengths could be zero, a specific value, or a value measured in characters, perhaps (For example, I could use a sample name/temp name as a way to calculate the widths). - ~~Display the font rendering samples as graphics during the translation/revision process.~~ **Describe alternatives you've considered** - About lengths, there's the chance that the same project has more than one string length values. Maybe the values could be targeted per component or maybe there could be a single, ""default"" value and then specific values for the minority components that have different string length parameters. - ~~About the font rendering, probably the best way to avoid a server overload is to make the graphic display on-demand, by the touch of a button, for example. Having a lot of images rendered and displayed could cause havoc in Zen mode. But if the actual TTF can be used as a web font, maybe the system could use it to display on-the-fly modifications, which could even work in Zen mode.~~ **Additional context** There's not much else I can think of right now. <bountysource-plugin> --- The **[$50 bounty](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/82498463-placeholders-for-rendered-size-check?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** on this issue has been claimed at [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github). </bountysource-plugin>",Can you please keep it one feature per issue?

**Describe the bugs** 1. Unable to use Weblate, since the documentation on how to create a new local translation project (no GIT) with different languages is missing. 2. After blindly going through the different masks to create a new project, I finally manage to get to the ""component update"" screen, but nothing happens after that. In the console of the webserver I just see:  The above seems to loop forever. **To Reproduce** 1. I have created a test document in OpenOffice that contains some demo text, shapes and formatting (1 page and English only). 2. This .odt document was then converted to .xlf and finally to .po and .pot with the help of the [translate toolkit](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/) 3. Since it is not quite clear what the use of GIT would be in this context and how to use it, I decided not go down the rabbit hole of configuring a separate local GIT server just to test Weblate. I found evidence in the documentation that [GIT was indeed not necessary](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/vcs.html) and that Weblate could manage this:  (The documentation does not explain what the differences or benefits are or how things work with this ""repo within Weblate"") 4. I then proceeded to manually upload my .pot.zip file and another .po file (it is not clear how they work and how they are supposed to be used here. Please see the screenshots in the .pdf on how I tried to use them.) 5. Attached screenshots show my entries to the system which are accepted (it took a lot of trial and error to finally get there, since nothing is really explained in the documentation!) 6. I finally get to the screen saying ""Component is being updated..."". This basically runs forever and nothing happens. What is this screen supposed to show? 7. In the console where I launched the webserver I can see that something happens in the background (see loop mentioned in ""describe the bugs"". **Expected behavior** Since a new user can't magically know what the different fields in the new project sections mean and what content exactly is required and in which format, more details are required for this part of the documentation. Alternatively the related fields could get some specific examples on what input is expected. What is the expected content of the .po and .pot files? Maybe I did something wrong there already, I have no way of knowing, since the documentation does not explain this at all. The documentation should show at least one use case of exactly how one is supposed to create / configure a new translation. **Screenshots** Please find attached screenshots in the sequence until I reached the ""Component is being updated..."" screen plus the looping console output. **Server configuration and status** **list_versions**  **check --deploy**  On Git checkout: Not applicable.

**Describe the bug** When your string contains special chars which are transcribed in XML, like & to &amp; the target char count is off.

I think the problem may be in when something was translated and then is marked as needs translation again. **Expected behavior** If I push an xliff file with something marked as ""need-translation"" should be shown as needs editing in weblate. <bountysource-plugin> --- Want to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/90842559-target-state-of-translation-being-ignored?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github). </bountysource-plugin>",What Weblate version do you use?,<bountysource-plugin> --- Want to back this issue? **[Post a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/90842559-target-state-of-translation-being-ignored?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F253393&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github). </bountysource-plugin>

I'm running SuperCollider 3.10.3 and I'm using Jack with supernova on macOS 10.14. Everything works perfectly, but when I start a pattern such as:  sclang returns a ""late: 0.620066"" message. I believe this has to do with the latency calculation when supernova boots:  Changing block size and sample rate changes the latency value but it doesn't solve the problem. It seems that supernova calculates a wrong latency value when using JackRouter as the audio device. Everything works fine, when I'm not using Jack.

nightwatchjs/nightwatch,https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/issues/2192,nightwatchjs_nightwatch_issues_2192,"[Bug] nightwatch timeouts trying to connect to driver with 100 dockers

first this bug looks similar to https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/issues/87 but I'm talking about latest nightwatch v1.2.1 and no selenium . ### Environment: * node.js v10 * nightwatch v1.2.1 * direct web driver (geko or chrome v76.0.3809.68) * chrome browser 76.0.3809.100 * all running inside a docker container (base image from ubuntu 16) The problem (probably a different solution than bug #87 mentioned above). When you deploy dozens of nightwatch containers , when they all try to connect to the browser in some cases it will work (slowly) but in other cases it will look like this: ### Verbose output  if you lower the number of concurrent nightwatch dockers on that host (lets say 10): it will succeed eventually. This is not a DBUS issue or a docker setting specific issue. It is simply the load of new connections and unix forks/spawn the nightwatch is creating in a large Kubernetes deployments. after investigating: when deploying nightwatch v1.2+ on a docker image in a large scale (Kubernetes) it will demand more resources than older version (v0.9+). you might need to increase the K8s max file handlers (ulimit and alike) to allow larger fork count and I/O connections. Furthermore, the K8s hosting machine will probably take more time to connect to the web chrome driver instance (or geko) . What used to be 100 milisec on a single instance will increase to 10,000 ms when run along many other nightwatch containers. So the solution for this swarm type is to increase timeouts. The bug was easily reproduced in a Jenkins environment when the number of Jenkins executors for the nightwatch job was higher than 80. ### Configuration  ### How to Reproduce:  ### Sample test my-nightwatch-test.sh may simply run this test: simple open a browser to google.com $ nightwatch test/sampleTest.js --env chrome",Can you please follow the [Bug report issue template](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)?,and in some cases it works but in other cases it will look like this

## Describe the bug Hi, I submitted this a while back to the geckodriver team (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/1546) and they said it was a bug with nightwatch. Still seems to be an issue. I am setting a textfield value in jQuery by clicking a link, and then trying to retrieve the new-value in a test. The code works as per the below simplified test, and when I turn on screenshots in the geckodriver, the screenshots show the textfield with the new-value. Despite this it won't retrieve the new-value, it will always return the old-value the field contained before updating it from a click.

Just wanna check up on a thing. I'm having some problems jacking-in to both clj and cljs at the same time. Really I wanna connect to two repls started elsewhere but this is the easiest to reproduce. I keep getting a (wrong-type-argument stringp nil) error. After digging around for a while I've traced it to sesman-friendly-session-p in cider-connection.el that tries to compare-strings on a nil value thats coming from the classpath filtering. This is because nrepl-send-sync-request '(""op"" ""classpath) ...) in cider-client.el gives me relative classpaths when running OpenJDK 10/11  While doing the same in OpenJDK 1.8 gives me absolutes:  Is this a known thing? If not should the fix be that nrepl should return absolute classpaths on JDK 10/11? My current workaround is removing nil values before compare-strings as seen at https://github.com/rpkarlsson/cider/commit/38b645a6f50d12012c3943aa5edcb713fe62c6d0. I know this will leave me with a uncomplete classpath but wanted to check here before digging deeper.

davidhalter/jedi,https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1458,davidhalter_jedi_issues_1458,"Use __annotations__ to decide type of dynamic attributes as specified in PEP526

https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1347 is related to this and already uses this for return types implemented via https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/commit/aa2dc6be09da315ff8ca28553fde0bda01ee0132 It seems that accessing and parsing __annotations__ is thus something that is considered useful for Interpreter contexts. This would also be another way to deal with issues like #1453 or https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1378 that are currently dealt with via https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/commit/923fcf95d991286302a6233eb4eb760b02fad1e3 which is not an ideal solution compared to this IMO My suggestion is to also parse __annotations__ on objects and classes and thus support [PEP526: Class and instance variable annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#class-and-instance-variable-annotations). Those are mostly ignored by the runtime and can be used to provide type information to IDEs and completers to specify that some attribute that might be hidden behind some __getattr__ magic or similar has a certain type without having to actually run the code (as is currently done). This should also allow to infer the type of an attribute that is e.g. declared as List[T] which could otherwise only be annotated if turning it into a property and annotating the property itself. Examples:   It must be noted that according to [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) those annotations will always be strings that have to be [resolved](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#id7). Without the from __future__ import annotations the dict contains the class/type directly.

Hi, I followed [this](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Calabash-config) guide for linking Calabash to my non-Xamarin.iOS project, and when running it directly from Xcode, my Xamarin.UITest's run fine. However, I want to build it as an IPA so I can submit it to VS App Center for testing. It seems that Calabash is not linked in the IPA, even though I targeted my new scheme. After I locally install the IPA and run my UITest: System.Exception : Unable to contact test backend running in app. A common cause is that the app is not properly linked with Calabash. Please verify that it includes the Calabash component. Sure enough: calabash-ios check Calabash.ipa shows it is not linked. A lot of posts recommend adding Xamarin.Calabash.Start(), though this is not a Xamarin.iOS project. It's actually a Unity project, I've embedded an HTTP server to act as the middleman, and it works quite well locally.

Firstly, I'm a first time commenter so my apologies if the format of this post isn't right. I'm using astroquery.irsa_dust for my research and am having some problems using get_query_table. I'm trying to open a number of identically-formatted data tables, retrieve the RA and Dec and then query IRSA dust for the extinction data (I'm using get_query_table rather than get_extinction_table as I'm specifically after just the colour excess). The code is shown below: from astroquery.irsa_dust import IrsaDust import astropy.units as u from astropy import coordinates import os from astropy.io import ascii for filename in os.listdir('./Data'): fp = open('./Data/{0}'.format(filename)) for line in fp: if line[0:2] == 'RA': RA = line.split()[1] if line[0:4] == 'DECL': Dec = line.split()[1] break print(RA,Dec) co = coordinates.SkyCoord(ra=RA, dec = Dec, unit=(u.deg,u.deg)) print(co) table = IrsaDust.get_query_table(co,section='ebv') I have a small subset of data in a folder called Initial_Data, and when I use this folder instead the code works perfectly. However, when using the full set of data as in the code above I get the following error: runfile('/home/matt/Documents/Lightcurves/extinction.py', wdir='/home/matt/Documents/Lightcurves') 53.599800 -28.714764 <SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg (53.5998, -28.714764)> Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<ipython-input-4-449177a18559>"", line 1, in <module> runfile('/home/matt/Documents/Lightcurves/extinction.py', wdir='/home/matt/Documents/Lightcurves') File ""/home/matt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/spyder_kernels/customize/spydercustomize.py"", line 668, in runfile execfile(filename, namespace) File ""/home/matt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/spyder_kernels/customize/spydercustomize.py"", line 108, in execfile exec(compile(f.read(), filename, 'exec'), namespace) File ""/home/matt/Documents/Lightcurves/extinction.py"", line 20, in <module> table = IrsaDust.get_query_table(co,section='ebv') File ""/home/matt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/astroquery/irsa_dust/core.py"", line 299, in get_query_table xml_tree = utils.xml(response.text) File ""/home/matt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/astroquery/irsa_dust/utils.py"", line 119, in xml raise Exception(""The dust service responded with an error: "" + message) Exception: The dust service responded with an error: ERROR: required input [location] is missing.

<!-- Please follow the template below --> # Describe the bug The recent archery update seriously brought up both damage and strength requirements for bows and crossbows. I dunno about damage, buth the STR requirements seem very unrealistic. I keep in mind design values - an average human has 8 strength, a strong human has 10, a very strong person has 12, a top-tier athlete has 14. Look: 1. A 205 crossbow/200 lb composite crossbow requires 12 strength to draw, compound crossbow requires 11. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdfmaC_t-Q) we have a man, drawing about 150 lbs with his bare hands, 300 lbs in sitting span and even more with very basic devices (**1500** lbs with a windlass, so the ingame heavy crossbow can be easily upped from the current 800 lbs). He's really not looking like a world-class athlete for me. 2. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IdfmaC_t-Q) another average man drawing crossbows. Yes, he's using basic devices - goats foot lever, the spanning belt and the gaff lever, but they're like REALLY basic ones - every survivor should be able to use one. He claims you're able to draw about **450 lbs** this way. 3. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohutwHqClOc) the guy drawing 80 lbs bows. 80 lb in-game bow requires 12 (!) strength, and the guy from the video is seriously not looking like the athlete or heavylifter. 4. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoSCl_qcJsQ) a man with 110 lb bow (14 STR req). Yeah, he's definitely strong, but he's not a world-class powerlifter. 5. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KokNtdh4_Y) a regular man easily drawing a 60 lb bow (10 STR req). Is he really about a half-way to the olympic championship? 6. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjY2QrU4sm4) a strong man indeed drawing 210 lb bow. Ingame wooden 145 lb greatbow requires 19 (!) STR. Man from the video is not a cyborg or mutant, I'm sure. 7. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrzPFIjAZdU) a 100 lb bow. 8. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmhYwboqBOg) a 90 lb one. There are lots of evidences, I think you got the point - both bows and crossbows, despite the great drawing weight, do not require tremendous physical strength as they require now. # Steps To Reproduce 1. Start as an average person with 8-9 strength. 2. Spawn a compound bow (high), composite bow, reflex bow, hybrid longbow, crossbow or composite crossbow. 3. There's no way to shoot with them. # Expected behavior Able to shoot from a bow or crossbow. A bow/crossbow with req 12 or even 14 STR is probably a ballista or similar siege machine. I don't touch damage or range, because they are calculated by some complex formulas, but STR req is set arbitrary, so it can be changed more easily. The lower cap is currently 30 lbs with 10 lb/1 STR. I suppose to remove the cap - straight 10lb/1 STR would be fine: i.e. 6 STR person could draw a string of a 60-lb hunting bow, but stronger person would still benefit in bonus range. 8 STR person could draw a 80-lb bow, etc. Self bow - 30 lbs - I guess even a feeble person or a kid can draw 30 lbs. Short bow - 50 lbs - maybe leave it as is at 6 STR, I guess, or lower to 5. Compound bow (low) - 40 lbs - it seems even a feeble person is able to draw it. Compound bow (normal) - 60 lbs - lower the requirement to 6 STR. Compound bow (high) - 80 lbs - to 8 STR. Compound bows are very easy to draw thanks to a pulley system. Composite bow - 110 lbs - to 11 STR. Recurve bow/Reflex bow - 60 lbs - to 6 STR. Longbow - 80 lbs - to 8 STR. Wooden greatbow - 145 lbs - to 14 STR. Maybe 15 if it strictly designed for superhumans only. Compound greatbow - 120 lbs - to 12 STR. Reflex recurve bow - 50 lbs - to 5 STR. 8 STR max for all crossbows (and even without the req at all with drawing devices). TL;DR: 8-9 STR should be more than enough for most string weapons, more for the heaviest ones only.","What exactly is your problem, again?","6.

CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA,https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/27085,CleverRaven_Cataclysm-DDA_issues_27085,"Proportional Ammunition Pierce

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Part of my archery re-balancing/improvements requires that arrows have proportional damage and piercing values that multiply the existing damage value of the bow they are fired from, with the intent of making archery more practical and realistic. As it stands, arrows and bows both have flat damage and pierce values. This is unrealistic and leads to inconsistent performance from different bows. While Knightosmaster was nice enough to add a proportional damage value, I still need a proportional pierce value to make my changes. **Describe the solution you'd like** Any and all ""gun"" items can have a pierce value applied to them in JSON. This represents the piercing value of a bow (or similar weapon) using a projectile with a terminal ballistic value of 1 (Or possibly 2, then non-bodkin arrows would reduce AP proportionally to bring them to appropriate levels. It depends on whether or not the base AP for the weakest bow is higher than 0). A ""prop_pierce"" value would then be needed on the ammunition in use, which multiplies the base pierce value of the bow it's fired from to give a final pierce value based on the input energy from the bow, and the terminal ballistics of the arrow itself. It's possible that I or others might make a mistake or simply not need to assign a pierce value to a weapon that might use proportional pierce ammo. If no pierce is assigned, the code would need to assume that the value is 0 and act appropriately. In practice, the idea is that I can have a bow marked with a base pierce value of 8. Firing a normal arrow out of it would apply the base pierce value of 8. A bodkin arrow with a prop_pierce value of 2 would be fired with an applied pierce value of 16. A crude wooden arrow with a prop_pierce value of 0.75 would be fired with an applied pierce value of 6. (Values are examples and not actual values for anything) **Describe alternatives you've considered** It's also possible that the appropriate pierce value could be drawn from the base damage of the weapon, then multiplied, but I feel that would make adding new content more difficult, requiring more math and messing about to get appropriate values. I could also just ignore proportional pierce entirely, but that leads to the current issue with bows and arrows. Namely, that a weak bow with high-quality arrows does dis-proportionally high damage and pierce. **Additional context** While I've mentioned primarily bows and arrows throughout this request, the same mechanic would obviously be applied to all similar weapons like crossbows, slingshots, and pneumatic weapons, which I also intend to take a stab at. The recent proportional damage PR from Knightosmaster does something similar, so could be quite helpful for direction. https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/26705 The terminal ballistics and proportional damage values are drawn from Poragon's ranged weapon damage/pierce guideline which I've been working on applying to archery weapons. https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/26183",How about we take a look at this rebalance before we add more currently unused features to support it?,(Values are examples and not actual values for anything)

Yoast/wordpress-seo,https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/14356,Yoast_wordpress-seo_issues_14356,"Metabox modal

Product owner: @JessieHenkes UX designer: @hedgefield ### What are we going to build? We intend to move the metabox features to a modal. Not everything is smart to move to a modal, because the analysis and other related features are needed near the text when you're editing, you don't want to have to switch back and forth. Therefore, only the social previews, premium addons and advanced settings will go into the modal. ### What problem does it solve? In preparation for the 'Inline suggestions' project we wanted to move all metabox features to the GB sidebar, but this poses quite a few challenges (sidebar becomes cluttered and doesn't offer enough real estate). It also makes it easier to port Yoast SEO to other CMSes. ### Designs #### Functional prototype Desktop https://sketch.cloud/s/r0zwq/a/jdkzgm/play Mockup for mobile https://sketch.cloud/s/r0zwq/a/ZDz9YG #### Design files https://sketch.cloud/s/r0zwq #### Component specs https://github.com/Yoast/design/wiki ### Additional info or requirements The modal is a kind of mix between sidebar and metabox. Therefore existing elements should be able to be put into the modal without modification. In the mockup we've updated the UI of the elements to match our design kit. This doesn't change a whole lot about the existing design, mostly in the premium addons which were lagging behind in help-icons-for-explanation and consistent form fields department. The modal can be opened from the yoast sidebar, via a primary open post settings button that appears sticky at the top of the sidebar, as can be seen in the mockup. For mobile, the modal falls back to the accordeon layout that the items had in the metabox/sidebar to make sure it all fits inside the screen while not losing the quick navigation between sections. Mockup linked above. @Sjardo will set up the HTML and CSS for this and then pass it off to @Xyfi.",would you like us to develop this aswell? https://sketch.cloud/s/r0zwq/a/gw4Kgd,".

Yoast/wordpress-seo,https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/issues/14198,Yoast_wordpress-seo_issues_14198,"Add support and UI for 'reviewedBy' schema

Google is increasingly requiring that sites and pages demonstrate their expertise, authority and trustworthiness ('E-A-T'). A common SEO tactic to influence this is to have content be (visibly) 'reviewed' by professionals. This is particularly common in sensitive content categories, such as medical advice. See https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-attack for an example, where the content _author_ is a ""Tricia Kinman"", and the page is formally reviewed by ""Elaine K. Luo, MD"". The [reviewedBy](https://schema.org/reviewedBy) schema property (in conjunction with the [lastReviewed](https://schema.org/lastReviewed) property) allows us to describe this relationship explicitly. ## Requirements - [ ] On posts and pages, add a UI component to allow an editor to specify values for a 'Formal content review'. This requires them to select a _user_ and a _date_. - When a valid _user_ and _date_ are set: - [ ] Add a reviewedBy property to the WebPage, referencing the Person by ID. - [ ] Add a reviewedDate property to the WebPage, with the date value (in ISO 8601 date format). ## Considerations - The review data should be stored as conventional post meta, so that theme/plugin authors can easily retrieve and display them. - We may wish to explore additional requirements to add _qualifications_ (e.g., medical qualifications) to user profile fields, as well as adjusting how we output _titles_ (e.g., 'Dr') so as to enrich the _reviewer_ entity. ## Mockup I've thrown together an example mockup in the 'Advanced' section of the post editor. Feel free to challenge/ignore this! ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11629607/72327768-04c02000-36b2-11ea-8735-4a4f15865103.png) ## Credit Props to https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc for the idea.","Does that person need specifics on their profile?

If you want to include console output, please use ""Steps to Reproduce"" below. --> **Update**: The real reason for the error isn't any packages but non-ascii characters in the prompt. See [this comment below](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7876#issuecomment-431558009). I created a new environment and installed a bunch of packages, and started to run into this error as soon as I installed Cython.  However, Cython is successfully installed. Without closing the shell, I could even install more packages like numpy, pandas etc. I get the same error after each installation but the package is successfully installed. I can verify this by importing the package and doing some elementary stuff. But essentially, conda is having trouble reactivating the environment. In a new shell terminal, I cannot activate any environment. The command conda activate my_env fails for all the environments that I have and produces the same error report [pasted in full in the Expected Behaviour section below]. ### Steps to Reproduce <!-- If the current behavior is a bug, please provide specific, minimal steps to independently reproduce. Include the exact conda commands that reproduce the issue and their output between the ticks below. --> FWIW, these are the contents of my .condarc.  I had created a new environment with python=3.6.

ocaml/ocaml,https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/9071,ocaml_ocaml_issues_9071,"Thread.exit considered harmful

I would like to deprecate/remove Thread.exit, because it prevents writing resource-safe code. When a resource is not handled by the GC (for whatever reason), a standard way of allocating it for a limited period of time is to use Fun.protect (or a ad-hoc re-implementation thereof). This function guarantees that the finally function it is given as parameter will be executed at the end of the execution of the other given closure. However, Thread.exit breaks this invariant, since it can terminate the current thread even before the finally function is run. Not only Thread.exit makes it impossible to use reliably such programming idiom, but it also incompatible with GC-based finalizers. Indeed, if Thread.exit is run from within a finalizer, then the running_finalisation_function will never be reset, which results in finalizers no longer be run at all by the program! I have related problems for my implementation of Statmemprof. There is an easy way to replace Thread.exit: simply throw a dedicated exception and catch it at the entry point of the thread. Note that some recent programming languages (e.g., Rust), do not provide such a thread exit function. What Rust provide, panic, does perform stack unwinding for cleaning resources. I know this proposal is likely to be polemic, hence I am not opening a PR, and wait for thoughts of other OCaml developers here. Cc @gadmm, who nowadays thinks a lot about resource safety in OCaml. Note that the same issue exists when a thread calls Unix.fork : in this case, all threads but one is killed, which causes the same problem as described above.",Did you investigate library usage on opam ?

**EDIT** On front office > customer order history page, show the last visible order status. At some point of the order flow, it might get a specific order status that the merchant decides not to display to the customer (option available in the status configuration). When the order gets this status, nothing is displayed in the customer account, which can create confusion for the customer. With this improvement, it will show in the customer account the last status the order had before getting this ""invisible"" status. Edge case : if the first status an order gets is ""invisible"" for the customer, then show nothing. **Initial description :** We received some complains from customer that can't see the order-status on the order history page. Our reply was always its there, or click on details. I never understood why they where not seeing anything until I realised that we use statuses that are invisible for the customers. Once an order is shipped, we change status for administrations reasons. The customer does not need to see this status. When the status is not there, customers think that their order was not processed and think they have to reorder. It causes a bit of confusion. I attached a screenshot with two orders. One order is cancelled, the other is put in to the next status phase. As you can see its empty ( status will show up once you click on details ).

PrestaShop/PrestaShop,https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/15697,PrestaShop_PrestaShop_issues_15697,"Improvement - Add an option in the cart rule to Apply discount on the original subtotal or not

**Improvement** Apply a discount on the original subtotal is the choice we need. From what I see in other systems this is usually a dropdown which says Apply on: [Original Subtotal] [Subtotal] **Describe the bug** I've created two rules that give a discount 8% and 2%. The amount in my cart is 57.35 so the discount should be 5.735 and the total should be calculated as 57.35 - 5.735 = 51.615 On the contrary prestashop is doing the calculations on the already discounted price thus ending up with a smaller discount for the customer. So in succession it's calculating 57.35 - 8% = 52.762 -2% = 51.70676 There is no option to configure this on the backend whether you want to do it this way or the other way but the thing is if the discounts are not calculated based on the original subtotal it's going to be very confusing for the users. Because the administrator is going to have to consider rule priority in order to give the correct discount amount and the customers will definitely nag because they think the discount doesn't add up. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: - create 2 discount rules for 8% and 2% excluding shipping - create a product with value 57.35 - go to cart and notice this cart result with the two discounts applied ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20220341/65612112-70c03080-dfbc-11e9-824f-0217cb05d804.png) - Furthermore the discount amount is also incorrectly calculated. It should be the difference between the two amounts so at least it should say 4.588 + 1.05524 = 5.64324 which is approximately 57.35 (subtotal) - 51.71 (total) **Screenshots** If applicable, add screenshots or screenrecords to help explain your problem. **Additional information** PrestaShop version:1.7.5.2 - 1.7.6.1 PHP version: 7.2 Recommended solution in my opinion: Add an option to cart rules ""Apply to"" with two options - Apply on subtotal - Apply on discounted subtotal In either case this scenario which is very common in B2B won't work as it is now. And in any case the discount amount should be calculated correctly. I can't even begin to understand which calculation shows 7 as discount amount.

I am fairly new to Quilljs. So, please bare with me as I attempt to describe my needs. I am using Quilljs 1.3.6. I want to add a button on an HTML form that will clear specific quilljs fields. If I use jquery on any non-quilljs field, all I have to do is create a button that calls a javascript function, that deletes the field(s). For example: <b>HTML</b> &lt;label for=""strengths""&gt;How strong are you?&lt;label&gt; &lt;input type='text' name='strengths' id='strengths'&gt; &lt;input type=""button"" onclick=""clearTextField()""&gt;Clear Field&lt;/button&gt; <b>Javascript File</b> function clearTextField() { $('#strengths').val(''); } How do I clear a quilljs field? I would like to do something like this: <b>HTML</b> &lt;label for=""strengths""&gt;How strong are you?&lt;label&gt; &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""strengths""&gt; &lt;div id=""strengths-container""&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blah Blah Blah&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;input type=""button"" onclick=""clearTextField()""&gt;Clear Field&lt;/button&gt; <b>Javascript File</b> function clearTextField() { strengths.setContents([]); } However, this won't work, because: var strengths = new Quill(""#strengths-container"", { modules: { toolbar: toolbaroptions }, theme: ""snow"" }); function clearTextField() { $('#strengths').val(''); } was created in a different function. So, the scope of the object is limited to the that function. Is there a way clear the contents of a field with quilljs, separate from the function that instantiated the object?","What do you mean by a field? Quill have full control of the DOM and expose an API to update the [contents](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#content) and [formats](https://quilljs.com/docs/api/#formatting), you shouldn't access it directly.","label for=""strengths""&lt;How strong are you?&gt; &lt;<b>HTML</b> &lt;label for=""strengths""&lt;How strong are you?&gt; &lt;div id=""strengths-container""&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blah Blah Blah&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;input type=""button"" onclick=""clearTextField()""&gt;Clear Field&lt;/button&gt; &lt;b&gt;Javascript File&lt;/b&gt;"

###### Which version and edition of Flyway are you using? Flyway 6.3.3 ###### If this is not the latest version, can you reproduce the issue with the latest one as well(Many bugs are fixed in newer releases and upgrading will often resolve the issue) This issue was not there in 4.2.0 but when we tried to upgrade to 6.2.2 this issue appeared. Upgraded with the latest version i.e. 6.3.3 but the issue still persists ###### Which client are you using? (Command-line, Java API, Maven plugin, Gradle plugin) Command-line ###### Which database are you using (type & version)? PostgreSQL 11.6 ###### Which operating system are you using? RHEL 7.5 ###### What did you do? Upgraded the docker image which has flyway bundle as the migration tool. Image is having SQL files which are checked in by our engineering team members. They uses different types of editor such as pgadmin,dbeaver,notepad++ All was good in 4.2.0 until we decided to upgrade to 6.2.2 to fix a security issue which popped up due to 2 of the DB drivers present in the flyway db. Once we upgraded, the security issue was resolved as the 6.2.2 version of flyway was using latest versions of the drivers but we started facing this ""unable to calculate checksum"" issue. Then we had to downgrade it back to 4.2.0 and decided to remove the drivers from the pack which were causing the security issues. Removal of the drivers from the image solved the problem but we want to upgrade the flyway now so that we don't have to remove the drivers ###### What did you expect to see? The expectation is that this issue should not pop up as we can't go and correct the type conversion to UTF-8 for each and every file. For lot of files used for different engines and modules we are facing this. Even we tried to convert one problematic file to UTF-8 in notepad++ but we were still receiving the same error. We have lot of SQL files checked in for last few years and now they have grown up so much that we can't go and correct each of them or ask our engineers to correct them and also we don't even know how the file changes will impact the upgrade process in customer environments using our product and also as I said we are not sure also that the issue will be resolved post the changes of UTF-8 conversion. Any configuration tweak may also help if there is a way so that this error can be bypassed. ###### What did you see instead?

**Update:** The issue seems to be tied to the version of Visual Studio and/or NuGet too, see [below](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues/2823#issuecomment-410200808). # How to reproduce the problem Add the NLog, NLog.Config and NLog.Schema packages to a .NET Core 2.1 Console Application project. # Expected behaviour The XML and XSD files from NLog.Config and NLog.Schema are copied in the project root. # Actual behaviour The files are not copied to the project root, instead they are somehow ""virtually linked"" there (there's no ""link"" at file system level) from the NuGet packages cache directories. # Why this is a problem 1. The content of the files are shared between all projects using the packages: if I modify the XML in project A, project B will see the same changes since the physical file is the same. 1. If the XML and the XSD are not besides each other, IntelliSense will not pick up the schema and won't provide any autocompletion.

### What did you do? For a data generator, I need to use lots of fonts in different sizes. Randomly one of that is used to generate a sample. Since I didn't want to load a font every time we generate a sample, I created a nested dictionary that dynamicalle loads fonts of a given size when it wasn't loaded previously. It worked fine at the beginning. Then I tried to generate some more samples (>1k) and got ""OSError: cannot open resource"" every time. I double checked the paths and tried to load the font with the same path and that worked just fine. It definitely isn't related to the path encoding bugs. To reproduce that, you can use the code below. ### What did you expect to happen? It should be able to load fonts until the RAM is full ;) ### What actually happened? OSError after loading exactly 509 fonts. After clearing my dictionary as soon as the error occurs (temporary workaround), it works fine again. ### What are your OS, Python and Pillow versions? * OS: Win10 * Python: 3.6 * Pillow: 5.4.1 Please include **code** that reproduces the issue and whenever possible, an **image** that demonstrates the issue.

### What did you do? 1. I'm using Pillow to create many individual images which I then stitch together to create a lyrics video for a song. - The app is online at https://www.rhymecraft.guru 1. One of the features of the videos created by my app is that, while showing an entire line of lyrics on-screen at once, the currently-pronounced syllable can be highlighted. - You can see an example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u9ylseLAfU 1. The way I achieve this is by: 1. first calculating where the X, Y coordinates of the line would start if the entire line of lyrics was drawn at once 1. then drawing the text *preceding* the highlighted syllable and recording the width of that text, 1. then drawing the highlighted syllable, using the original X, Y coordinates and the width of the preceding text to calculate where the highlighted syllable's X, Y coordinates should start, 1. then proceeding in the same way to draw the text following the highlighted syllable. ### What did you expect to happen? I expected that the current syllable would change color without any other visible changes. ### What actually happened? The text spacing always doesn't seem to work totally right, so the lyrics sometimes get spaced out.

Rule: [AccessorClassGeneration](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#accessorclassgeneration) Possibly a false-negative. Having a sub-class that calls a private constructor is bad practice. It requires the compiler adding another package-private synthetic constructor with an additional synthetic anonymous inner class parameter that forwards to the private constructor so that the subclass has something non-private to call. Examples for this would be for example  where the default constructor of Bar calls the private no-arg constructor of Foo or  where the call to the private constructor is explicit. This adds unnecessarily additional constructors and also can cause problems if you use the class from Groovy code, as in the first example new Foo(null) and in the second example new Foo(null, null) can not be executed as there is a disambiguity between the constructor you meant to call and the synthetic added constructor. It is usually better practice to simply make that constructor package-private direclty, eliminating the need for any synthetic constructors.",Could you please confirm this and update the report accordingly?,Rule: [AccessorClassGeneration](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#accessorclassgeneration) Possibly a false-negative.

There are no errors in the console, either. I have set the DB2 ~~directory~~ EXE path (I'm using GZDoom Builder specifically, but that should work too).

Using 'import-export v==1.0.1' This is my stack trace:  My ModelAdmin class inherits from ImportExportModelAdmin, and when using the admin interface I can click export and choose CSV from a dropdown. Upon submitting, I get error TypeError at /admin/reception/service/export/ __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'sortable_by' Looking at ExportMixIn get_export_queryset it appears the error comes from this line: cl = ChangeList(request, self.model, list_display, list_display_links, list_filter, self.date_hierarchy, search_fields, self.list_select_related, self.list_per_page, self.list_max_show_all, self.list_editable, self ) From ChangeList docs: class ChangeList: def __init__(self, request, model, list_display, list_display_links, list_filter, date_hierarchy, search_fields, list_select_related, list_per_page, list_max_show_all, list_editable, model_admin, sortable_by): I'm not sure why it's just self at the end of of that line of the get_export_queryset method in the ExportMixIn class. It seems there might be a missing argument for this line? What else I've tried: In my ModelAdmin I put resource_class = ModelResource and wrote a corresponding ModelResource for each of my models.

whatwg/fetch,https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/865,whatwg_fetch_issues_865,"Allow servers to take full responsibility of cross-origin resource protection

Some servers want to completely opt out of cross-origin request protection, as evidenced by https://enable-cors.org/. This is a common use case. Unfortunately, the there described way of opting out has recently been broken due to tightened security, as discussed in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/862. Client applications stopped working, and the solution was at the server side. So https://enable-cors.org/ needs to be extended, and servers have to be reconfigured. This will take years to propagate. To make matters worse, security can be tightened again at any point in the future, which will again break apps, and force new server-side changes. I therefore propose the introduction of a header where the server states it will assume full responsibility of cross-origin resource protection, which is a future-proof way of opting out of any such protection on the client side. Servers who do not require any protection (think open data), or servers who have their own protection mechanisms (various forms of auth) will prefer that option to keep on working indefinitely. Servers with other needs can still resort to client-side protection and more granular CORS headers.",What is needed to get this issue on a high priority list?,"origin resource protection, which is a future-proof way of opting out of any such protection on the client side.

jazzband/pip-tools,https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/973,jazzband_pip-tools_issues_973,"pip-compile bumps setuptools within commented-out spec

If you have a `requirements.in` which contains a package which depends on `setuptools`, for example:
```
$ cat requirements.in 
protobuf  # or google-api-core, ipython, pandas-gbq, pydata-google-auth
```
Then after running `pip-compile`, you get:
```
$ cat requirements.txt
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile
#
protobuf==3.10.0
six==1.12.0               # via protobuf

# The following packages are considered to be unsafe in a requirements file:
# setuptools==41.4.0        # via protobuf
```

As you can see, `pip-compile` refuses to include `setuptools` directly in a generated `requirements.txt`, instead adding a section with the comment ""The following packages are considered to be unsafe in a requirements file:"".
This behaviour is fine in the general (and I don't disagree with the comment or behaviour).

However because the commented out `setuptools` line includes a version number, when `setuptools` releases an update then the `requirements.txt` file ends up looking out of date.

Say you had committed a `requirements.txt` which looked like:
```
# requirements...

# The following packages are considered to be unsafe in a requirements file:
# setuptools==41.4.0        # via protobuf
```

Then `setuptools` releases `41.5.0` and now when you run `pip-compile` you get:
```
# requirements...

# The following packages are considered to be unsafe in a requirements file:
# setuptools==41.5.0        # via protobuf
```

This is inconvenient if you happen to regenerate your `requirements.txt` at some point after an upstream releases, however if you're also using `pip-compile` to check that your `requirements.txt` is in step with your `requirements.in` (see #882) in CI then it means that your build now fails for what is essentially a non-change.

I'm not sure what the right solution is here, though perhaps if there was a way for pip-compile to understand its own commented out dependency that might help?","Could you add more details, attach the `requirements.txt`, provide commands you run?","If you have a `requirements.in` which contains a package which depends on `setuptools`, for example:

I am using a pykafka 2.5.0 (and 2.8.0-dev.2 just to make sure this is not version-related, at least starting from 2.5) to consume messages from a kafka cluster.

stripe/stripe-android,https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/issues/2022,stripe_stripe-android_issues_2022,"[3DS2] Can't get charge id after confirmint PaymentIntent

## Summary
I'm implementing the new version of Stripe (SCA-READY), version 12.8.2.
Everything is working as well.
But I need to get the charge ID after confirming the PaymentIntent to send it to my server.
ID that I receive from my server (which forward stripe response) after confirming the PaymentIntent.
However, I do not receive this ID when the process needs 3ds2 (or 3ds).

(the followings snippets only represent the charges part, if you want the full JSON, ask me in comment)

[Here is the response's snippet](https://pastebin.com/pcSfQeqb) without 3ds2 authentification

Then there is the response's snippet when the 3ds2 authentification is needed:
```
""charges"": {
    ""object"": ""list"",
    ""data"": [],
    ""has_more"": false,
    ""total_count"": 0,
    ""url"": ""/v1/charges?payment_intent=pi_1FxfoiHk0bG3YRQo1hU4c6f1""
  }, 
```

I can't retrieve the charge without the id of this one accord to the stripe [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/object)

Then I also don't have any attributs which correspond to the charge in the PaymentIntent from stripe sdk after the 3ds2 has been processed that I can get in callback in the activityResult (triggered after the 3ds2 authentification to handle the result):

```
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
        if (requestCode == PaymentMethodsActivityStarter.REQUEST_CODE && data != null) {
            val result = PaymentMethodsActivityStarter.Result.fromIntent(data)
            val paymentMethod = result?.paymentMethod
            adapter.renderCard(paymentMethod)
        }
        val isPaymentIntentResult = paymentServiceProvider.stripe.onPaymentResult(
                requestCode, data,
                object : ApiResultCallback<PaymentIntentResult> {
                    override fun onSuccess(result: PaymentIntentResult) {
                        adapter.processStripeIntent(result.intent)//The intent accessed here hasn't any charges (stuff like amount paymentMethod, but nothing about charges)
                    }

                    override fun onError(e: Exception) {
                        Toast.makeText(this@ClientMainActivity, e.message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
                    }
                })
    }
```

terralang/terra,https://github.com/terralang/terra/issues/345,terralang_terra_issues_345,"How to implement an object system in Terra?

Hi! Me again :)

I'm trying to implement an object system on top of Terra that allows both overriding and overloading and I can't seem to find a way to do it, despite a week of struggling. 

I should probably mention that my intention at first was _not_ to write a language extension since I don't want to introduce new syntax, but I went down that road because I couldn't do what I wanted with existing metamethods. In particular, I need to control what happens when a new method is defined in order to implement auto-overloading behavior, see #336 (I also wanted metamethods for assignments in order to implement properties - see #340, ~~but I gave up on that~~ update: that was solved).

So by making a language extension I thought I could implement auto-overloading easily, but that added in more problems. First, you can't just create a bunch of interdependent Terra functions because the eager type-checking will bail on recursive references. You can't stub them all and add the body on a second phase with `resetdefinition()` either because there's no API to get the return type of a quote (#339) so you'd have to give up return-type inference. Another thing I tried was to build dependent methods on a `__methodmissing` hook, but there's no API to select an overloaded definition from an overloadedterrafunction object given a set of arg types (probably what `tryinsertcasts` does), so you wouldn't know how to return the right definition. 

I also studied javalike.t and it is using an undocumented ""sturct constructor"" syntax which receives the newly created type at a very convenient moment when all methods are specialized but not yet compiled, which allows the entire methods table to be replaced with vtable stubs and everything just works afterwards. This is a luxury I don't have when creating functions ""by hand"" I suspect because of eager type-checking. An API to pause and resume compilation (i.e., enable/disable eager type checking) might help here, if I understand the issue correctly that is.

There's always the option of making a parallel language from scratch that compiles to Terra but I would end up with a second Terra implementation with semantics slightly off, and a lot of code duplication. So the idea of gradually extending Terra is much more appealing to me, but I think that more of Terra's guts would have to be exposed for that. 

I'm open to suggestions on how to do this differently of course :)",What are you actually trying to achieve overall?  Why do you think you need overloading?  Does your overloading need to be run-time or compile-time?  Etc... Etc...  :-),~~~~ update: that was solved

flashmob/go-guerrilla,https://github.com/flashmob/go-guerrilla/issues/201,flashmob_go-guerrilla_issues_201,"go-guerrilla doesn’t support “RCPT TO: <Postmaster>”.

# [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321)

```
   Any system that includes an SMTP server supporting mail relaying or
   delivery MUST support the reserved mailbox ""postmaster"" as a case-
   insensitive local name.  This postmaster address is not strictly
   necessary if the server always returns 554 on connection opening (as
   described in Section 3.1).  The requirement to accept mail for
   postmaster implies that RCPT commands that specify a mailbox for
   postmaster at any of the domains for which the SMTP server provides
   mail service, as well as the special case of ""RCPT TO:<Postmaster>""
   (with no domain specification), MUST be supported.
```
```
   o  The reserved mailbox name ""postmaster"" may be used in a RCPT
      command without domain qualification (see Section 4.1.1.3) and
      MUST be accepted if so used.
```
```
   Syntax:

      rcpt = ""RCPT TO:"" ( ""<Postmaster@"" Domain "">"" / ""<Postmaster>"" /
                  Forward-path ) [SP Rcpt-parameters] CRLF

                  Note that, in a departure from the usual rules for
                  local-parts, the ""Postmaster"" string shown above is
                  treated as case-insensitive.

JuliaParallel/MPI.jl,https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl/issues/337,JuliaParallel_MPI.jl_issues_337,"segmentation faults when combined with @threads with memory allocation

One of our users was having problems with their hybrid MPI/threaded Julia code segment faulting on our clusters.

OS: Linux (CentOS 7)
Julia: 1.3.0
OpenMPI: 3.1.2

I simplified their code down the following demo

```julia
using MPI

function main()
    MPI.Init()

    Threads.@threads for i in 1:100
        A = rand(1000,1000)
        A1 = inv(A)
        oops = A1[1.6]
    end

    MPI.Finalize()
end

main()
```

- ~~exceptions sometimes turn into segmentation faults inside of `@threads for` loops~~
- for a reliable segmentation fault you need to perform a reasonable amount of work in the loop

disintegration/imaging,https://github.com/disintegration/imaging/issues/104,disintegration_imaging_issues_104,"Image orientation issue with latest iOS 13.1.2 ""Choose Image Size"" feature

In iOS 13 when uploading an image you are prompted with the option to ""Choose Image Size"" on the selected image, to reduce the size of the original file for upload. This is optional, and you can upload the original large file if you wish.

When uploading the original image file, without using this feature, the image ends up being rotated properly by use of:

```
i, err := imaging.Decode(file, imaging.AutoOrientation(true))
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

But, if you choose to resize the image to ""Large"", ""Medium"", or ""Small"" (using the ""Choose Image Size"" iOS feature), the uploaded image does not correct the orientation and remains rotated.

I believe iOS is doing something to the image uploaded with ""Choose Image Size"", that Disintegration is not taking account of. Perhaps there are additional computations and checks that need to be ran to properly adjust the orientation data of these images.

EDIT: test image below.
- without AutoOrientation set to true, if you upload the original it should display rotated in an HTML img tag.
- with AutoOrientation set to true, it will correct the rotation to confirm it works.
- but, if you resize the image with the new iOS feature and upload it, it will not correct the rotation. Display it in an HTML img tag to test.
- the image says ""Orientation: 6 (Rotated 90° CCW)"" on the TIFF tab of the inspector of the Preview app on macOS.
