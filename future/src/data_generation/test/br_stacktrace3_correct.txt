org.jsoup.HttpStatusException: HTTP error fetching URL. Status=403, URL=http://gfycat.com/NeglectedMellowKoi

Sometimes, I get the gfy, most of the time not. I generally get the 403 error. I've tried switching to a different network via VPN, and even switching computers. I still get 403 errors.

I searched around, and it seems like it's a common issue (?), but I'm not savvy enough to know if it's on my end or not.

Thanks!
