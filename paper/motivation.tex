\section{Motivation}

The idea for this work comes from a recent paper that proposed a technique based on a neural formulation of EVPI in the context of forum posts, e.g., Stack Exchange, intending to augment such posts with edits that improve their quality~\cite{rao-daume-iii-2018-learning}. Our work focuses on bug reports and uses a different formulation of EVPI that is better suited to both the diversity of bug reports and to the specific ways bug reports can be improved via follow up questions.


Motivation of the problem from GH Repos.
How many BRs arrive at the most popular repos (is the traffic bursty)?
Are  follow-up questions related to each other (they should be)? Are the same follow-up questions asked over and over (they shouldnâ€™t be)?
