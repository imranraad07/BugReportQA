\section{Motivation}


%The problem is real, i.e., there are repos that have more BRs than they can manage. How many BRs arrive at the most popular repos (is the traffic bursty)? how many lack OB/EB/S2R from these?
With the increases in the speed of software development and delivery, software users
commonly interact with recently modified software. As all software can contain bugs,
users often observe and quickly report failures.

The preconditions are present, i.e., there are a lot of follow-up questions on GitHub
