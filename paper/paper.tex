\begin{abstract}
% quality bug reporting is important
The availability of quality information in bug reports that are created daily by software users is key
to rapidly fixing software faults.
%
% Despite the success of efforts to make bug reporting consistent and detailed, numerous bug reports still lack
% sufficient important information.
%
Automatically improving and augmenting bug reports that are incomplete or
inadequate can make software maintenance more effective and improve software quality.
%
In this paper, we propose a system that addresses inadequate bug reports by automatically posing follow-up questions,
which are intended to elicit answers that add value and provide missing information to a bug report.
%
Our system is based on a selecting follow-up questions for a bug report by leveraging a large corpus of already posed follow-up questions.
%
We use a combination of information retrieval and deep neural networks to rank and select
follow-up questions for a bug report by using the similarity between the text in pairs of bug
reports.
%
As another component in our selection, we estimate the utility the expected answer to the follow-up question would provide
to the bug report.
%
Evaluation of our system based on a manually annotated held out data set indicates improved
performance over a set of baselines.
%
A survey of software developers indicates that the follow-up questions are useful and specific to a bug
report most of the time and can provide new information some of the time.
