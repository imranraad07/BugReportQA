\begin{abstract}
% quality bug reporting is important
The quality of information contained in bug reports created by software users is key
to efficiently fixing software faults.
%
Automatically improving and augmenting information in bug reports that are incomplete or
inadequate can make bug triagers more effective and improve software maintenance.
%
In this paper, we propose a system for automatically posing follow-up questions for
inadequate bug reports that are intended to elicit answers that add value and provide
missing information to a bug report.
%
Our system is based on a ranking a large corpus of already posed follow-up questions.
%
We use a combination of neural networks and information retrieval to rank and select
follow-up questions using the similarity of the text of their bug report to the current
bug report of interest and by estimating the utility the expected answer to the question would provide
to the bug report.
%
Evaluation of our system based on a manually annotated held out data set indicates improved
performance over a set of baselines.
%
A survey of software developers indicates that the follow-up questions are useful and specific to a bug
report most of the time and can provide new information some of the time.
