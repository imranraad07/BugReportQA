duckduckgo/Android,https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/386#issuecomment-433597487,"Thank you so much for raising this issue. We've had a few people mention similar type problems with the latest release, but it wasn't clear exactly what they were describing or when it was happening from their reports.

This, however, is fantastic. This will definitely help identify the problem. In fact, I have a pretty good suspicion on where to look already.

My problem so far was that I was unable to replicate the problem. If I can continue to have this problem, would you (or anyone else looking at this ticket) be in a position to test a fix?"
duckduckgo/Android,https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/431#issuecomment-461229116,"I can't reproduce the issue. What device are you using?
I always see the last page in address bar, when I clear it and put ""!"" there are suggestions appearing always. Clear and put ""!"" again doesn't help."
duckduckgo/Android,https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/415#issuecomment-453870743,"Thanks for reporting this.

Can you clarify something: when you share to the app, and you see the new tab page, does the shared link open in a background tab or not at all?

Also, can you share with me details of 

1. which app version you're using?
1. if you've enabled automatic data clearing or not?
1. does it do it sometimes, or every time?

This is sounding very related to a bug I've just fixed (merged, but not yet released). 

Hopefully it's the same thing and the bug will be fixed for you in the next release."
duckduckgo/Android,https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/235#issuecomment-378199281,"Thanks for reporting this @BigNickBurgess. I will investigate. A few questions to help me reproduce this:
• Which device and android version are you on?
• What is broken on reddit? Does the page load? Can you login?
• Does toggling off the privacy protection toggle in the Privacy Dashboard fix the issue? You can get there via the Privacy Grade button next to the search bar.

mozilla-mobile/focus-android,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/291#issuecomment-287567857,"I can reproduce this only if webfont blocking is enabled. However, disabling webfonts in firefox for android doesn't break this (I don't know if that means our webfont blocking is broken, or if firefox's blocking is broken).

This could be the result of our blocking methodology, I'll need to debug the page in question to figure out. (My theory is that the font files aren't being loaded as a font but instead directly by JS or some other mechanism, hence firefox doesn't block them since it only blocks files being loaded via the font loading mechanism, whereas focus blocks all files that are fonts, regardless of where they're being used.)

I wonder if that means we'd need to provide an explanation that webfont blocking can break some sites (we already have text that could be used as part of the ""Block other content trackers"" pref)? Webfont blocking is disabled by default, so this shouldn't affect users until they select webfont blocking."

mozilla-mobile/focus-android,https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1231#issuecomment-326069602,"So far the implementation only does:
* Remove the scheme (http://  https://)
* Removes common unspecific sub domains (m. www. mobile.) - Code borrowed from Fennec

I noticed two things:
* We only allow opening new tabs from the context menu. Using this I often opened a bunch of tabs  that are from the same ""page"". Meaning at least the domain (and sometimes parts of the path) are the same for a bunch of tabs. Making it hard or impossible to distinguish between them.
* Strictly following the spec I end up with pages that are reduced to the same ""label"":
** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Focus -> m.wikipedia.org/wiki
** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla -> m.wikipedia.org/wiki

Picking a ""label"" from a URL is pretty hard. We had this discussion a bunch of times for Activity Stream and whatever algorithm we pick there are always cases where it doesn't work correctly. I understand that we need to somehow cut off the string if it's too long - but I'm not sure why we purposefully make it shorter if there's space to show more.

Unfortunately I have no other proposal. Sometimes the domain is important, sometimes the path and other times the page title is the most helpful.

Can't think of any way to prevent AppCompatDialogFragment from providing same package in getArguments(), so ignoring may be the best action. Tangentially: what behaviour should occur when there are no applications other than Focus available?

One note is that my solution compares to see if the packageName of each AppInfo is equal to the current application's packageName: if you are using, for example, Gecko, you will still be prompted to open the app in Focus. Could potentially instead filter based on the existence of the expression ""org.mozilla.focus"" within the AppInfo's packageName, but this is a little bit dirtier."

- What version of Android are you using and on what device?
- When you clicked ""From Local Filesystem"" and then selected the OPML file, did it get as far as letting you select the podcasts you wanted to import?
- Once you confirmed the ones you wanted to import, did it say 'processing'?
- If you wait a while, (30+ seconds), do the podcasts start showing up in the navigation drawer (the thing with the three horizontal lines that shows 'Queue', 'New Episodes', etc...?)

Here is the crashdump that occurs when sharing in to AntennaPod:

However, it returns `Content-Type: application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8`. In the commit that fixes this issue, there seems to be an exact equality check with ""application/octet-stream"". I'm not clear on whether the `;charset=UTF-8` would be stripped earlier on, or if the check would fail due to this.

I see the header running:

```
curl -s -I http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/podcast.mp3?fileId=76531597-C7D0-46DB-BAC129F111B99A1C

Also, AntennaPod seems to retry a download immediately after throwing the File Type Error. This seems to be hammering the notification tray, and presumably the server. Is there supposed to be a limit on how soon a retry should happen?

brave/browser-android-tabs,https://github.com/brave/browser-android-tabs/issues/1570#issuecomment-494729050,"Once an Ad notification has been added to the notification list (even if the device is asleep) the Ad will be confirmed as a View. I believe this is working as expected as when a user on Android then taps this Ad (while the device is awake) in the notification area then this would be confirmed as a Click.

Spec (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QynlNXswjNfhxGeilooS9TjQsIPkYvgpZH8y9FJdRy4/edit#):

""The Heads up format works in the foreground and the background. The basis for Heads up;
1. Opens in system tray when Ad is in foreground
2. Opens on top of lock screen or non Brave App if running in background""

@mandar-brave @anthonypkeane your thoughts please? If you agree we can just close this ticket as `Wont fix`"

I believe this is working as expected as when a user on Android then taps this Ad (while the device is awake) in the notification area then this would be confirmed as a Click.

Spec (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QynlNXswjNfhxGeilooS9TjQsIPkYvgpZH8y9FJdRy4/edit#):

""The Heads up format works in the foreground and the background. The basis for Heads up;
1. Opens in system tray when Ad is in foreground
2. Opens on top of lock screen or non Brave App if running in background""
