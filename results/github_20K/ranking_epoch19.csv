mpv-player_mpv_issues_3859,"Foldered DVD/Blu-ray have problems seeking
Seeking is weird with these. It produces problems with playback, and sometimes with image. [Here ](https://mega.nz/#!bM1lGTTK!SjkcEyMd1t1mv9gubRzIN-nvA-grPlhWoSoRQyckb8Y)is a video displaying the three possible outcomes I've found. **Case 1** This is what happens with 99.9% of DVDs, and some Blu-rays, that I've tried: with a small value (0.8), seeking forwards gets stuck, and seeking backwards either gets stuck, or goes forward. Seeking with a high value (35) works fine. **Case 2** Seeks backwards fine, but gets stuck on forward with a low value. Also, the video is screwed during and shortly after seeking, plus sometimes there's a problem in which after seeking, the video plays super fast and desynchronises itself with the audio (not seen on the recording I did). **Case 3** Opening from VIDEO_TS - Works perfectly up to a certain point, From this point on, I can no longer advance by seeking forward because it goes back to a this specific point every time I attempt (the frame it goes back to varies depending if I use the high or low value). The only way for the video to advance is just letting it play. If I let it advance a bit, and then seek (high) forward one time, it has another point of return, but I still cannot seek forward. If I let it advance, and then seek forward many times, it goes back to the original point of return. Opening from VTS_01_0 - Almost everything works properly. The only exception is that seeking backwards with no-osd needs to be done constantly, otherwise it gets stuck.",Can you try and put together a [reduced test case](http://jsbin.com/axedog/latest/edit)?,"Can you provide a reduced test case please?

dotnet_orleans_issues_320,"Handling multiple environments / versions of a cluster
Hi We're struggling with questions around handling versioning and environments of an Orleans application (details ahead), and I'm hoping there might be some directions or tips on how to handle this. If there was already a discussion about this (I didn't find one), please point me to it. The situation in question: You (we) have an Orleans application, and there are state-full grains in it. Now we want to deploy a new version of the application. There are two main steps for deploying a new version: 1. Upload the new version to a staging environment. In this phase the old and the new version lives side by side, and the new version is being tested. 2. Deploy the new version to production. Since this requires a cluster restart, it actually means deploy the new version to a new cluster, and then ""switch"" between the old and new clusters. Both this steps contain a bag of problems with handling grains and their states. For the sake of the example, lets assume we have in the application a _UserGrain_ that represents the state of a user. So while in staging, if the same user switches between staging and production, there may be a conflict between the states in each environment. Since there's a _UserGrain_ for the user in each environment, each holding its own state, they will be different (even if it gets persisted, the other grain in the second cluster does not know it needs to refresh its state). A different flavor of the problem appears when switching between the old and new versions. This is never a ""singular point in time"" event (unless you can sustain downtime, which you normally can't). This means that there might be requests that are still handled by the old version while the new version is already up. So again - a _UserGrain_ of a user might change state in the old version while this not being recognized by the new version. This can be potentially handled by ""streaming"" all changes from the old version to the new version, but this seems to be a huge overhead and complication to the system. Are there any best practices for handling this? How do you handle production changes?",How do you run your tests and what fails while doing so?

raspberrypi_linux_issues_450,"Latest firmware outputs HDMI 7.1 channel PCM as 5.1
The latest firmware (based on 3.10.19+) produces 7.1 channel PCM as 5.1 at the receiver. Using the current raspberry.org download of Arch Linux with its older firmware produces 7.1 channel PCM as 7.1 channels at the receiver, something went wrong around the time of the up-step from 3.6.x to 3.10.x. Copying the current *.dat, *.bin and *.elf files to the stock Arch Linux installation makes the problem happen there too. Running a 3.10.19+ kernel built using the Arch Linux config doesn't fix it. (Also the solution for the previous problem of S/PDIF encoded audio not being decoded at the receiver doesn't work with Arch Linux and 3.10.19+, though it is fine on Raspbian with the same firmware and the same 3.10.19+ source kernel built using the Raspbian config (which Arch Linux won't boot) ...

cakephp_cakephp_issues_8440,"3.2.4 - Saving BTM as entities with joinData not working as expected
This is a (multiple allowed): - [x] bug - [ ] enhancement - [ ] feature-discussion (RFC) - CakePHP Version: 3.2.4 - Platform and Target: PHP 5.6.10, MAMP running Apache on port 80 ### What you did So, I know I've brought up stuff like this in the past and it usually came down to a user error, but I've been trying to get something to work for about 12 hours and I'm pretty sure it's a bug. I can't get `_joinData` to persist when saving BTM entities. For all examples, the `$this` context is inside `UsersTable`. Using arrays works as expected, `users_crews` has two records, one with primary=1, one with primary=0.  However, when running the above twice, it throws an integrity error, since the joint records aren't being checked to already exist. I'd expect that to happen automatically, but I guess with link, you have to manually check and unlink? That seems messy. ### Expected Behavior Patching an entity with BTM entities with _joinData should work as expected. ### Actual Behavior Explained inline above.","What is your field types in the database?

zeromq_pyzmq_issues_341,"Memory leaks with PyPy
We are benchmarking PyPy vs CPython while using ZMQ as a communication library, and for both interpreters we tried PyZMQ and ZMQPy libraries. Using PyZMQ, we discovered what seems to be a memory leak. In attachment you will find the benchmark we use. You can compare both environments with virtualenv, and check that in CPython it works normally, but with PyPy it consumes several memory gigabytes in few seconds. The bash script to launch is named ""launchpy-tcp.sh"". We are stuck by this bug in our benchmark and development, so we would be very happy if you could find the actual reason for this issue.

eslint_eslint_issues_2674,"key-spacing sees separate alignment groups despite no blank lines
I'm using the latest version of eslint (currently v0.22.1). The ability to signify different groupings for the key-spacing rule via newlines is great. However, it is biting me when long values within my object definition wrap, or when I have a value that is also an object. As I have key-spacing configured to align on value, in these cases, I expect my definition to align the outer values with each other, and the inner values with each other, like this:  This is exactly how my IDE formats such an object. However, key-spacing then complains that there is extra space before the value for 'isDefault'. It is treating the 'isDefault' property as part of a group separate from the rest. I see the same behaviour when I wrap and then indent a long value. I expect a new group to start only when there is a _blank_ line between the properties, not just a new line.

openlink_virtuoso-opensource_issues_462,"SERVICE and unnecessary remote query submissions
Hi, I have observed that virtuoso performs many unnecessary remote query submissions in some cases. For example, the following query contains two independent SERVICE clauses:  If the query is submited, then the second SERVICE clause is sent to the remote server by virtuoso. Subsequently, for each returned solution of this clause, the first SERVICE clause is sent to the remote server. However, these two clauses are independent, so the same query is sent to the remote server multiple times (10 times in this case).

However, I was confused by the why since I shouldn't be using all of the 20gB that I originally purchased. Rummaging around, I asked docker what images it had, and there are a lot of them. (see below). Is there a way to prune these (e.g. is it safe to execute $docker system prune ??) I tried $docker image prune, but nothing was pruned.

dedupeio_dedupe_issues_529,"MemoryError
Using the pgsql_big_dedupe_example.py we have successfully run sets of a million and 10 million records but fail at 20 with a repeatable memory error. Via the stack trace we have found the error to occur with the scoreDuplicates method. It seems that it is one of two problems happening within the mapping and reducing steps. 1. Within fillQueue, when records are being fetched from the records_queue the optimization step that is asserting current < last_rate and increasing chunk size by a constant multiple of 1.1 does not have an upper bound. Moreover, the chunked records are immediately being loaded into a list ( chunk = list(itertools.islice(iterable, int(chunk_size))) ). Without an upper bound this can grow exponentially. We have changed this to a constant of 1 and were able to get through the mapping step in scoreDuplicates. 2. Within mergeScores all records from the score_queue are being concatenated into a numpy array. It seems this array is needed to compute the max pair length to generate the python_type to be used in the memmap? If so, is it possible to determine the max length without having to load all of the pairs into a numpy array? This way the scores can be written to the memmap in chunks.

meteor_meteor_issues_2727,"Cordova app data usage increases with app restarts
Hi, So we are seeing an issue where each time you exit the app (via the task manager) and start it again, the data size under the application manager increases. Eventually we see the app increasing to a ~200MB data size wherein it starts crashing - This occurs on both the emulator and Samsung Galaxy S4 Kitkat. This not only hamstrings development with hot code reloads but makes the app very unstable. Saw the same issue in a simple test app as well. A further consideration: It seems that (as per the docs/wiki) the cordova app will fetch the new JS and other static assets if the code was updated (HCP) and if HCP occurs after the app is installed on a device then THIS issue starts occurring wherein each restart of the app causes it to **fetch the new JS and (possibly?) static assets even though it fetched them previously.** Attached are subsequent shots from only restarting the app i.e. killing it in task manager and starting it again - no login, no actions on the app itself. Observed on Meteor versions 0.9.2.2 and 0.9.3 Is this something that others have observed or are we messing something up. ![screenshot_2014-09-30-15-36-04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5299934/4456423/4ffe0882-488a-11e4-89af-e21eb6cd047f.png) ![screenshot_2014-09-30-15-37-07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5299934/4456425/500557ae-488a-11e4-851a-4fe89dde5c73.png) ![screenshot_2014-09-30-15-38-11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5299934/4456424/4fff6006-488a-11e4-9464-add00f701fcd.png) ![screenshot_2014-09-30-15-39-05](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5299934/4456426/500a9ae8-488a-11e4-9bd3-398210a0b70b.png)",how do I close it? do I install it again? do I push new code? multiple times? when does the size grow?,can you mention what is wrong here brother?,Can u pls provide a minimal repository with reproduction?,What are the values for the variables in your example?,What else did you expect?,Do you have the logs for when it _does_ connect to the webview?

On Shaka 2.0.0 I'm running into a strange issue where the player consistently loads the lowest quality stream option.

I also tried using mp4frag and both manifest files had the same behavior. As a side note, if I use videoJS with the dash plugin (an alternative to shaka), these manifest files work great (they load the highest quality video on high bandwidth connections).

The problem is that when the Raspberry Pi screen is rotated using the following in config.txt  And I use dispmanx_snapshot() to to get a snapshot of the rotated screen some of the layers are not shown with the same dimensions as they appear on the screen. As an example if I use omxplayer to play the Big Buck Bunny clip from /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/hello_video/test.h264, the clip is displayed on the entire width of the screen (and centered horizontally). However the snapshot looks like this:- ![bbb](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305783/6463579/93e5969a-c207-11e4-9a8a-34a35964b6cb.png) However, If I run omxplayer using the -b option to get a fullscreen black layer behind the playing video, I get this:- ![bbb-b](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305783/6463605/eba57be8-c207-11e4-8efa-13c8b6e51aa8.png) So now the background layer is distorted, and the video is displayed as it looks on the screen. I wonder if this is related to [issue 295 - dispmanx snapshot and dispmanx full screen layers](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/295) that I raised last year.",What you expected to happen instead Requesting a new rule?

When I run vim with vim-airline outside tmux it looks OK, but when I run it in Tmux background colors in mode and line indicators disappear as presented on picture above. I have tried various $TERM settings (xterm, screen, xterm-256color, screen-256color in .bashrc and .tmux.conf, even in .vimrc) and also vim t_Co and t_Cu options. Running Tmux with -2 flag also doesn't help. When I run it inside Powershell the same happens. The only configuration that I found to work well with WSL+tmux+vim+vim-airline is to log in through ssh with Putty.

Let's release the first iteration of the saved objects system (on the new platform) as a core Kibana service that: * exposes a Saved Objects Client as it works today * allows a plugin to replace the Saved Objects Client * probably via a register-new-Client-factory method * supports Spaces Once the bare service is written, we will push it up as a Feature Branch on Kibana for everyone to follow until it merges with `master`. Since this looks a lot like the existing functionality in the legacy platform, what are the benefits of doing this work at all? * **API Clarity.** In the new platform, we'll have better support for changes to the saved objects client. * **Core Service Responsibility.** A great benefit of this work is the need to explore interactions between the Elasticsearch Service, Http Service, and Saved Object Service.

hpbuniat_jquery-popunder_issues_8,"Body Click & IE Error
Thank you much for the last update. The following is a tip and a bug fix. I played around with the code and made some changes that you might be interested in. By changing the third parameter in '$.popunder' to 'body', I was able to get a pop under the moment the customer clicks anywhere in the body. There's no longer a need for a button or a link. $.popunder(window.aPopunder, '#testForm', 'body'); Also, IE yelled at me while doing a pop under. It was complaining about a bug on line 284. When I commented out the line, IE was no longer complaining, but Chrome displayed a blank page as a pop under. To fix this, I wrapped line 286 in a browser check for IE. I replaced line 284 with the following: if (navigator.appName != 'Microsoft Internet Explorer') { t.lastWin.document.location.href = t.lastTarget; } Now, IE blinks twice, which is weird (you should probably see for yourself after you make the change), but it does what is desired.",Did you consider opening an issue on Safari side?,Maybe I should trigger a slight pause for FF-users?!,Would you be able to check this?,Why?

yiisoft_yii_issues_1099,"Gii Model Generator loads all components to find all CDbConnection components
In the latest 1.1.11 release, it appears that the default Model generator for Gii causes issues under certain application use cases. In the file framework/gii/generators/model/ModelCode.php, the method ModelCode::getConnectionList() performs a call to CModule::getComponents(). Then, ModelCode::isDbConnection() loads every component that is not of class CDbConnection. If the application developer uses their own subclass of CWebUser with custom methods, and has components configured in main.php that use these custom methods, the call to Module::getComponent() in ModelCode::isDbConnection() causes an exception, due to the fact that GiiModel::init() sets the 'user' component to use CWebUser. One possible workaround involves subclassing GiiModule, overriding init() and using a different user component than CWebUser, but this could cause unexpected results. Is there some alternate method of generating a list of all components that are instances of CDbConnection as performed in ModelCode::isDbConnection(), or perhaps some other way of avoiding loading all components? One idea, perhaps a bit hackish, is to check for all component configs where the required parameter CDbConnection.connectionString exists, which appears to be unique in usage throughout the framework. But, this might be better than iterating through, and loading, _every_ component? The suggestion to check for connectionString in the component configurations opens the possibility for problems, should the application developer decide to create a component with a configurable parameter called $connectionString, so checking for instances of CDbConnection is more robust, in that sense. The above is not suggested as a robust solution to the problem, but rather an attempt to stimulate determination of alternate methods of finding all instances of CDbConnections. Perhaps a combination of the two -- first determine if the component configuration contains the required connectionString parameter, and second, load the component and check if it is an instance of CDbConnection -- is a valid fix here? Are there cases where connectionString would _not_ be present for an instance of CDbConnection?

nodejs_node_issues_4420,"ArrayBuffer.isView() and buffer.buffer property
Hello! _ArrayBuffer.isView_ thinks of node buffers as views to _ArrayBuffers_. Is this correct behaviour?  Because this is a bit non-intuitive, as ArrayBuffer.isView() is expected to detect TypedArrays, DataViews and stuff with _ArrayBuffer_ as a .buffer parameter (according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer/isView)). Indeed, buffer.buffer instanceof ArrayBuffer — that is awesome (finding that out while writing this), but at least _that needs to be covered by [docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html)_ (?). Also buffer.buffer, which is _ArrayBuffer_, has _byteLength_ very different from the _Buffer.length_. That is because of shared memory for Buffers, etc, but makes that inner ArrayBuffer useless, unfortunately. [.isView in spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-arraybuffer.isview).

golang_go_issues_22197,"runtime: proposal/rfc for chansendn, fastpath optimization for broadcasting same value to buffered channels.
Currently the runtime has a single channel send generic send function that I am aware of, which attempts to send a single value to a buffered or buffered channel. I propose defining a chansendn(c *hchan, ep unsafe.Pointer, n int, block bool, callerpc uintptr) bool (this may need to return an int of the number of sends) function that has an additional parameter N that indicates the number of sends to attempt before falling back to the original *chansend* behavior. Where an attempt is defined as these additional two operations - If a blocking request try to drain the recvq until N is 0 or recvq.dequeue() returns nil. [1](https://gist.github.com/cstockton/2c7e9346af7b7daad11bf9a754a3716e#file-chan-go-L29) - Regardless of Blocking or Non-blocking, until N is 0 or the buffer is full place the item into the buffer. [2](https://gist.github.com/cstockton/2c7e9346af7b7daad11bf9a754a3716e#file-chan-go-L36) **Benefits:** This will allow an ssa pass to optimize code such as:  I created an [example](https://gist.github.com/cstockton/2c7e9346af7b7daad11bf9a754a3716e#file-chan-go-L36) in user space as an experiment to illustrate and would be willing to do the work I'm proposing, I believe I could create a reasonable patch for the runtime. I have never done anything in the ssa backend but thanks to all the documentation for existing passes and current loop optimizations I could put something together for an initial review I believe. Since there will be a learning curve for the latter I wanted to see if the change was reasonable before I went much further.

Hi, I'm using the COLLADA loader with Maya 2012's FBX_DAE exporter and the CgFxShader plug-in. I extended the loader to handle the extra parameters associated with these sorts of surface materials, and the extra technique written into the COLLADA file. I'm inclined to share these extensions here, but wonder how people feel about the fact that I'm handling COLLADA output that's clearly broken -- Maya fails to write boolean parameters at all (it writes their names, but no values), and mat4 (float4x4) values inorrectly (no spaces between values, so you get strings like 1.00000.000000.00000.00000.00000.4147870.8823220.00000 .... etc)? In addition, loading the Maya-appropriate (and web-inappropriate) cgfx code is not supported -- rather the name is just grabbed and I let my ThreeJS process load the correct matching web-appropriate material (a bit like managing the ""init_from"" strings in images, which I use to load DDS files after the fact, rather than as part of the COLLADA read).",Maybe it would be better to write a converter?

grpc_grpc_issues_17704,"[.NET Core, Windows] gRPC server shutdown blocks if child process was spawned
Running gRPC C# 1.17.1 under .NET Core on Windows. One process starts a gRPC server and then spawns a child process. After having exchanged a few gRPC calls with yet another process it needs to close, but is unable to close the server gracefully - ShutdownAsync task never completes until the child process is killed, though in our use case that child process needs to stay up. I understand that gRPC has [issues with forking in Python](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/fork_support.md). Could it be that the same behavior that causes these issues is responsible for my problem? Note 1. The child that blocks the shutdown doesn't use gRPC. Note 2. If gRPC server is started AFTER spawning the child the problem stops reproducing. Note 3. The child is spawned using .NET System.Diagnostics.Process API. If the latter is replaced with CreateProcess P/Invoke with inheritHandles=false, the problem disappears. (We consider it a work-around, not the solution, since we are aiming for cross-platform code.) Note 4. gRPC peers are also spawned by the main process, but are not relevant since they are closed by the time the main process starts closing.

CleverRaven_Cataclysm-DDA_issues_28793,"Spawns inside moving vehicle
**Describe the bug** When running over enemies that spawn more enemies on death, they're very likely to spawn inside the moving vehicle that flattens them, causing massive damage to everything they touch inside the vehicle. Biggest offenders are every fungal enemy that spawns spores and to a lesser degree Necromancers, bigger Blobs and Zombie Masters with their blob spawns. **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Make heavy vehicle, big roomy interior with unarmored roller drums in the front make this bug appear very frequently. 2. Run over fungus spores or blob spawning monsters. 3. The resulting spawns are likely to spawn inside the moving vehicle, colliding with everything in the interior. Parts without any kind of armor plating can get destroyed instantly, especially solid parts like vehicle welding rigs and kitchen units and the like. **Expected behavior** Spawnlings shouldn't spawn in the interior of the vehicle, but rather somewhere outside of it. **Versions and configuration(please complete the following information):** - OS: [Windows 10] - Game Version: [0.D-572-gc62f18a] - Graphics version: [Tiles] - Mods loaded: [Dark Days Ahead, Disable NPC Needs, Filthy Clothing, Simplified Nutrition, Just Craftable Gunpowder, Makeshift Items Mod, PKs Rebalancing, Alternate Map Key, Mutant NPCs, More Locations, Fuji's More Buildings, Urban Development, PK - No Doom Monsters, Nonperishable Overhaul, DinoMod, Medieval and Historic Content, Vehicle Additions Pack, Tanks and Other Vehicles] **Additional context** There is another bug report I made about dead zombies reviving through vehicle floors, the solution to this and that problem could be the same one.

divio_django-cms_issues_4538,"Admin pane at page edit page is being refreshed - probably, too often
In the admin interface while editing a page content the user can open an admin pane at the left side of the window. In our scenario, the user opens the admin pane and open the pages structure view there. He/she click the site name at the top menu, and chooses ""Pages"". The problem is that this pane is being refreshed from time to time. It looks like the admin frame is being reloaded. In installations with many pages (we have ~1000 with ~50 at top level) it takes time. Users complain that it is really inconvinient and disrupts thier work. People tend to expand the admin pane to full screen, and like to work with the pages structure in this full screen mode. Reloading happens without any notification and all of sudden, for instance, while you are moving a page from one branch to another. What are the reasons behind the reloading of the admin pane?

hashicorp_packer_issues_4264,"amazon-chroot should support instance store AMIs
Packer currently has three EC2 AMI builders: `amazon-ebs` and `amazon-instance` both follow the ""make a box, change the box, pack the box"" process. `amazon-chroot` is the ""make an image, pack the image"" process, which is what I want, but at present it supports only EBS-backed images, which is not what I want. The official Amazon AMI tools support both processes: self-packing via `ec2-bundle-vol` (which `amazon-isntance` uses) and packing an image by `ec2-bundle-image`. I'm thinking the `amazon-chroot` packer would make a filesystem on an EBS volume, `chroot` into it, do all the things, unmount it, snapshot the volume and register the snapshot as an EBS AMI like it does now – and then `ec2-bundle-image` the root partition, upload the bundle to S3, and register the bundle as an instance store AMI. That said, it's my opinion that the official tools for instance store AMIs are a huge pain, so I made an alternative. There's an [`aws_bundle` Go library](https://github.com/willglynn/go_ami_tools/tree/master/aws_bundle) which handles all the bundle format details, and an [`ec2-bundle-and-upload-image` command line tool](https://github.com/willglynn/go_ami_tools/tree/master/cmd/ec2-bundle-and-upload-image) which takes a disk image as an input and bundles it straight to S3. There's no temporary files, no Java or Ruby dependencies, and no RSA keys or X.509 signing certificates. I dare to call it convenient 😀 I note also there's no particular reason that AMI creation has to be done inside EC2, though that's [true for EBS as well](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-import-snapshot.html). I'm asking to add this to `amazon-chroot` anyway since what I _actually_ want is to create both an EBS-backed and an instance-store AMI containing the same bits at the same time, and adding a second output to the `amazon-chroot` packer seems to make the most sense.",Can you share the full Ansible log?,Could you please give me a simplified build file that will reproduce so that I can fix it ?,Can you share a simple template?,Can you show me some sample code to reproduce this issue and post the error log (exception trace) if possible?,Can you share bootstrap.sh please?

As you may see the drm-engine: **Init Manifest:** ![drm-engine-manifest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5814582/32189768-1d759752-bd82-11e7-96ab-0002a846cfed.png) **Drm-engine:** ![drm-engine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5814582/32189766-1d4ca8a6-bd82-11e7-827e-e30fc3267642.png) After the ad, when protected content is started to play, playback fails at [stream_utils](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/blob/3cd18bb3362841d76db737204a15141b815b7c92/lib/util/stream_utils.js#L116) due to [keySystem](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/blob/3cd18bb3362841d76db737204a15141b815b7c92/lib/media/drm_engine.js#L1427) . Because keySystem returns null. Small note: variant.drmInfos has the keys while keySystem variable is null.

Shazwazza_ClientDependency_issues_125,"ERROR CDFLogger - Could not load file contents
Hi Shannon, I recently deleted a JavaScript file (/scripts/videojs.js) that was no longer required in my project. The file was loaded via the ClientDependency bundler - Html.RequiresJs(). I have removed all references to the file entirely from the solution. When I deployed the change, I modified the ClientDependency version to ensure it no longer tries to the fetch the file. When I inspect the bundled JS file that the ClientDependency serves to the browser, there is no reference to the file's functions that I removed whatsoever. Therefore Umbraco should not be attempting to load that file anymore. However when I check the Umbraco logs, I see the following error repeatedly: ERROR Umbraco.Web.UI.CdfLogger - Could not load file contents from /scripts/videojs.js. Domain is not white-listed.

curl_curl_issues_2582,"HAVE_POSIX_STRERROR_R is defined too late
### I did this Cross-compile curl using dockcross for armv6 using the following script:  ### I identified the following problem I believe `HAVE_POSIX_STRERROR_R` should be set to 1 for this platform, which is why I pass `-DHAVE_POSIX_STRERROR_R=1` [in my script](https://ptpb.pw/5umC/sh#L-12). But my argument is somehow ignored, and the build still fails. If I run `cmake` twice, as in [this script](https://ptpb.pw/DMnb/sh), then it works. Looking into the CMakeLists.txt, I realized that commenting [this line](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L981) out was solving the issue. I don't know how `CURL_TEST` works, but it seems to me that `HAVE_POSIX_STRERROR_R` is not set until [line 1156](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L1156), as follows: 1. `HAVE_POSIX_STRERROR_R` is defined in [`curl_config.h.cmake`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/curl_config.h.cmake#L486). 2. `curl_config.h.cmake` is generated from [`lib/CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/CMakeLists.txt#L3). 3. `lib/CMakeLists.txt` is called after the `CURL_TEST` in the main [`CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L1156). ### possible fixes 1. Run this [`TEST_CURL`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L981) after [`add_subdirectory(lib)`](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L1156) (this worked for me). 2. Run `add_subdirectory(lib)` somewhere before `TEST_CURL` (I did not manage to do that) I would be glad to write a PR if you believe one of those fixes makes sense.

jekyll_jekyll_issues_3927,"Markdown not rendered on regeneration after changes to root-level files
On several test installations of jekyll 3.0.0.pre.beta8 (on both CentOS 7 and OS X), I've found that my sites build correctly the first time and regenerate correctly (and incrementally) on post changes. However, if I make changes to files at the top level of my source directory, such as index.html or _config.yml, then after regeneration, the index page shows raw Markdown rather than rendered content. This problem did not occur with jekyll 2.5.3. (Similar behavior was noted in [#3747](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3747).) Steps to reproduce: 1. Start with a clean site, e.g., `jekyll new`. 2. Modify index.html to display post content, e.g.:  3. Do `jekyll build`. Observe correctly rendered results in index.html. 4. Make any modification to index.html—even just `touch index.html`. 5. Once again, `jekyll build`. Incremental regeneration occurs. 6. Check the rendered index.html page. Everything that was inside `{{ post.content }}` is now raw Markdown. If, between steps 4 and 5, I either delete .jekyll-metadata or do `jekyll clean`, the problem does not occur. (If I use `jekyll build --w` the problem occurs but can't be avoided by deleting the metadata file.) And, I should reiterate that the problem doesn't occur if I merely make changes to items in the _posts directory, and it isn't evident if the index.html doesn't show `{{ post.content }}` or if the post content contains no Markdown or liquid tags. In addition, individual post pages are just fine after regeneration, Markdown intact; it's just the index.html page (as far as I've observed) that isn't correct.",Did you try `encoding: utf8` (no hyphen)?,Can you try it with `rougify -l liquid`?,Maybe this can be merged into #3747?,Did you consider using includes for the HTML parts?,"Can you give an example of “everything works as it should be,” with the specific differences you are seeing?

arduino_Arduino_issues_4987,"Fix documentation about int ""roll over""
Currently the [documentation for `int`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Int) claims that `int` wraps when overflowing.

Hey! I have a suggestion for an addition (and perhaps I could even undertake implementation if you think it's worthwhile and would accept changes!) to the signal support in `playhouse`.

I can imagine that in the save handler of a Model, we'd look at the fields for any dirty FKs, and fire a signal at them. Does that make sense? Do you think that would be useful?

Hello, Mr. Maih and RISE Community. I have a simple New Keynesian model with two exogenous switching regimes. The model is nonlinear. When I do 1st order simulation, everything goes as expected, i.e., I can replicate the 1st order IRFs. Yet, when it comes to 2nd order simulation, my variables converge to a different steady state, even when I set all shocks to zero and fix the regime path at, say, regime 1. In this case, I would expect all variables to stay put, which is not happening. I feel like missing something pretty obvious, so I'm sorry if the question is too basic My codes are attached.

symfony_symfony_issues_12274,"[DX] Proposal: Abstraction layer for functionnal testing
Hello everyone! This issue is a proposal: it's an idea I give because I implemented it and I find it useful. I would like to share it and ask opinions as I think it would be a great improvement in Symfony2 tests usage. # The problem The testing capabilities of Symfony are very useful, especially when it comes to functonnal testing. It promotes testing in PHP applications and it's great. However, I think there is a problem with the current implementation: it too low-level (and Behat is much too complex to set up for beginners). The classic example is the authentication in tests: the doc is great but let's be honest, having to include 10 lines of obscure code is not really easy and intuitive. # The idea The idea is to implement useful helpers in `WebTestCase` class. For the moment, the helpers I can think of would be: - a login helper, as presented here : http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/testing/simulating_authentication.html ; - a crawler filter for the content (globally, it would in fact do a XPath filter on `html:contains(xxx)`) - a simpler way to select and send forms (the ideal would be in a line of code) ; It is an idea to debate.

Hi, I am surely missing something. But what is the reason the javascript files don't make it into the (or ""a"") jar file?

davidhalter_jedi_issues_1388,"Jedi struggles with pybind11 modules
We want to offer a completion for our pybind11 modules using Jedi 0.15.1. I don't understand why it works sometime and sometimes not. Let's start with a simple example:  Jedi is able to complete the module, the object Pet and its functions. But we get no information about the parameters and we are not able to complete the return type of the function getName(). The curious thing is that the Jedi Interpreter is able to complete it. But only if a docstring is given. So our questions are: 1. Why is Jedi not able to complete the pybind11 modules without any help of the docstrings? 2. Why sometimes Jedi is able to offer signatures and completions using the docstring and sometimes don't? 3. Why can Jedi interpret the dosctrings for objects when using the interpreter, but not when using Script.completions()? 4.

So I run BC with Railcraft and Traincraft and Mystcraft. I think Railcraft has the World Anchor, which is essentially a chunk loader. I made a Mystcraft age, and was lucky enough to find a massive underground lava lake. I placed the world anchor (keept loaded 9x9 chunks), keep it fueled, placed the pump near it, and it started to work. Then I placed an ender tank on top of the pump and it sent the lava to my homebase in another dimension. Now here's the problem: Once I leave the Mystcraft age and go back to the base in overworld dimension, lava stops being sent from the Mystcraft dimension. So I go back to the age to check it out, and the pump is no longer working. I have to break the pump and replace it to work again. If I leave the age/dimension, it'll stop working again. At first I thiought it was the Railcraft World Anchor malfunctioning, so I went with chicken chunk loader, same problem. So essentially I'm stuck in the Mystcraft age to keep the lava pumping.

libfirm_cparser_issues_23,"Ambiguities not correctly resolved & yacc grammar
Under the ""tests"" directory in C11parser (on GitHub: https://github.com/jhjourdan/C11parser) you will find a range of programs that exercise some of the more arcane ambiguities that many C11/C18 implementations get wrong -- including yours. False negatives (errors reported by cparser that are not errors) in: atomic.c, c11-noreturn.c, c1x-alignas.c, control-scope.c, function_parameter_scope.c, function_parameter_scope_extends.c, if_scopes.c, loop_scopes.c False Positives (programs accepted by cparser that have errors) in: bitfield_declaration_ambiguity.c, dangling_else_lookahead.c, dangling_else_lookahead.if.c, parameter_declaration_ambiguity.c, parameter_declaration_ambiguity.test.c The following also require further examination: aligned_struct_c18.c, atomic_parenthesis.c, bitfield_declaration_ambiguity.ok.c, bitfield_declaration_ambiguity.fail.c, dangling_else_misleading.fail.c The C11parser contains a parser that correctly resolves the first 2 groups of programs. The lexer and parser are in CAML, but the lexer is readily convertible to C and a YACC version of the parser is also provided. The companion article describing the situation more fully may be found here: http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/publis/jourdan-fpottier-2016.pdf The most important points made in it are that scopes are not always contiguous (as illustrated by the *scope*.c test files above) and resolving variable/typedef name ambiguity requires lookahead (as illustrated in *dangling*.c, *declaration*.c).

jacomyal_sigma.js_issues_569,"Edges in canvas mode severally affect navigation even with edge drawing off
I'm working with a graph based on a gexf file with 500 nodes and 10.000 edges. Edges drawing is disabled most of the time, but when a node is selected, the edges connecting this specific node is rendered. The rendering of the graph is however much heavier than a graph where the edges have been entirely removed - even though drawEdges is set to false and the edge render therefore never are run. The navigation works as it should if I e.g. move all the edges to another object and delete them from the graph object. However adding them back to the graph object again results in the problems reappear. I have created two stripped down versions: http://elite.cadm.dk/basic_sigma.html http://elite.cadm.dk/basic_sigma2.html The two file are identical except that all edges are manually removed from basic_sigma2. I have recorded the cpu usage on the two making a zoom-out. In the version with edges sigma.classes.camera.applyView, sigma.renderers.canvas.render and a few other files all end out taking nearly 10 times as long to render. I have however no idea as to how I should figure out what is in fact going on in these files and hope therefore that somebody else have a suggestion as to what is going on in sigma.

Tribler_tribler_issues_3488,"[BSc Seminar] Exploring the scalability of various blockchains
This ticket will contain the progress of the Bachelor Seminar course. Project description: Supervisor: @devos50 Blockchain technology holds the promise to transform the way trust is cultivated between strangers. Bitcoin created money without the need for banks. In the past, people were required to trust a central bank and a host of other intermediaries when making payments. The fundamental technology of Bitcoin, blockchain, radically reduced the need to trust financial middlemen. It bootstrapped an economy where no one can be stopped from spending their money. Despite widespread speculation and ecosystems being worth billions, blockchain in general suffers from scalability issues due to inefficient mechanisms for fraud prevention. Bitcoin is theoretically limited to seven transactions per second and Ethereum has a throughput of around 20 transactions per second. There have been various scalability efforts like proof-of-stake, sharding and tree-like block graphs, however, broader adoption of blockchain stays out. Recent work of our group explores more scalable solutions with unbounded scalability by using a novel technique called implicit consensus. Our experimentally evaluated consensus mechanism dubbed CHECO has superior scalability compared to other solutions. The goal of this project is to review the scalability of (recently proposed) blockchain solutions. Due to the abundance of proposed cryptocurrencies, you should select the most interesting and/or scalable blockchain fabrics and briefly evaluate them in your survey. The evaluation should be focussed on public, permissionless blockchain ledgers. Note: this is a challenging assignment, recommended only for honour students or potential cum-laude students. Prior knowledge of blockchain is helpful but not required. References Vukolić, Marko. ""The quest for scalable blockchain fabric: Proof-of-work vs. BFT replication.""

libts_tslib_issues_104,"ts_read does not work for multitouch-only device without EV_KEY
Hi, Thanks to b8594cca450ee2b07476f0cbe5fb806c13289ddc, my touchscreen (a Melfas MMSxx on a Galaxy Nexus) now works with tslib despite not emitting the singletouch API's EV_KEY event (as detailed in #102).

However, `ts_test` and programs using `ts_read` (like DirectFB) do not, though from #103 it seems that both `ts_read` and `ts_read_mt` should work for multitouch devices.

jhlywa_chess.js_issues_128,"Castling Issue
Hello - I am using Chess.js with Chessboard.js and have an issue with castling. I play this opening set of moves on chessboard.js and the castle move only moves the King and not the Rook. Ruy Lopez Open 1.e4 e5 2.f3 c6 3.b5 a6 4.a4 f6 5.O-O xe4 Chess.js translates to: e2-e4 e7-e5 g1-f3 b8-c6 f1-b5 a7-a6 b5-a4 g8-f6 e1-g1 f6-e4 Upon move 5 for white, o-o, the actual move should be e1-g1, h1-f1 for white. When I modify the code to catch a Kingside Castle (looking for 'e1-g1' string) I pass this for the move: board.move('e1-g1', 'h1-f1'); This is input from chessboard.js. The code works and the castling happens. However, at this point chess.js loses the sequence for whose move it is. It should now be black's turn in this example but chess.js has counted the castle as a white and black move and wants to move the white pieces for the next move. Is there a way to pass a flag to tell chess.js not to count the castle as two moves? Or is there a way to toggle whose move it is within chess.js?

Brian, Do you have a base example of how to use pep.js within JQueryMobile page widget? I have a pepContainer inside a JQM page. The first time pageinit fires, I add the pep(). when pageshow fires the start, drag, and rest events fire just fine. However, when pageshow fires again, start and rest fire ok, but the drag does not. I know this is generic, without code, but I'm thinking the placement of the pep code must have to be different for JQM. Which code goes in main page, which inside pageinit, and which inside pageshow. But, no clue what is turning off the move/drag. I think I just need to see an bare bones example of using a pepcontainer inside a JQM page.

rust-lang_libz-sys_issues_43,"Windows-msvc is slower than Linux or macOS (no asm)
I'm using libz-sys in a multithreaded PNG encoder and found that [my Windows builds run slower than Linux or macOS builds](https://github.com/brion/mtpng/issues/3); much of the difference seems to be down to how zlib is built. For my test compressing a very large screenshot on a single thread: * static version: 671ms * vcpkg-built zlib1.dll: 646ms * manually-built zlib1.dll with asm: 596ms * Linux version on WSL: 555ms (Something like 2/3 of the total runtime is in deflate.) Using the vcpkg version (with VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1) seems to give a small boost of a few percent, but a bigger win comes from manually rebuilding zlib1.dll with assembly optimizations and dropping that in over the vcpkg version. This gets my whole run going almost as fast as the Linux version. Would it be worth special-casing the msvc builds to pull in the x86/x64 assembly bits? I'm not sure how hard that is with the cc crate build framework (they're extra .asm files that need to be run through the assembler into .obj files, not inline assembler in .c files). Or should there be an easier way to drop in a customized zlib build if you need it?

pandas-dev_pandas_issues_22055,"DOC: Example on how to parse comments
As a bioinformatician, I frequently use Pandas to parse hideous scientific file formats. Often standard biological file formats include a section of header comments that provide useful information about the file, such as reference build, species, versioning, etc. For example, a typical VCF file: #VCF v1.1.4 #RefBuild: hg19 #Assay:Oncopanel #CHROM POS REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO 22 123845 A G . . STRAND=+ Above, we'd need to know the RefBuild to determine which species and genome version we are working with, and Assay to let us know which assay of mutations that we are looking for. There are all strange manner of things found in these headers that is often important to our analysis. Currently, I would need to read in the file once without Pandas to grab the header information, and then read it in again with pandas to skip the commented lines and turn the content into a dataframe.

blueriver_MuraCMS_issues_1187,"Tag problem
Earlier this year, my site was upgraded from version 5.1 to version 6.0.5376 The upgrade went fine except for just one thing. I make use of “tags” by specifying a list of specific postcode (zipcode) sectors within the UK (to enable enquirers to be directed to the correct contact for their geographical area). In the previous 5.1 version, these postcode sectors were listed simply as text in a field with each sector separated by a comma (e.g. NW1 4,NW1 5,NW1 6,NW10 2, etc). At any time, I could add to these sectors, remove sectors, or amend existing postcode sectors. However, it can be seen from the attached image, (in current version 6.0.5376), the tags are represented as images that incorporate an “x” symbol. You would think that clicking on the “x” would make that particular tag disappear. However, the screen seems to be completely frozen (I cannot delete any tags, amend any tags, or add any new tags). This happens both with pages that have been converted from version 5.1 and new pages that I currently create in version 6.0.5376. I was wondering if anyone has come across this situation before? I would be most grateful of any suggestions that might resolve this issue. Many thanks.

It would be nice to have a way to easily query the states which are available to a Minion from the renderer. This would make things like this possible:  This is basically a way to deal with the fact, that the brokeness of Windows package management can't be handled by `modules.win_pkg` alone and often requires more complex states containing workarounds/extra steps/etc, which could then be provided by drop-in states like formulas - where no specific state is available, it'll simply fall back to `pkg.installed`. I believe there are quite some other scenarios where querying the list of states available to a Minion could be used as well - ideas, critics + input welcome. EDIT: I'm not sure whether making this a [dunder dict](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/dunder_dictionaries.html) is the best way to do this or whether simply something like `salt['state.available']('sls', 'foo.bar')` would make more sense.",Would that suffice?,What about when you copy your gitfs backend into /srv/salt as well?

tilemill-project_tilemill_issues_969,"Wishlist: Color solver
In this example from Geography Class: # country::fill[zoom>=0] { [ADM0_A3='ABW'] { polygon-fill:@purple; } [ADM0_A3='AFG'] { polygon-fill:@red; } [ADM0_A3='AGO'] { polygon-fill:@yellow; } [ADM0_A3='AIA'] { polygon-fill:@blue; } [ADM0_A3='ALB'] { polygon-fill:@purple; } [ADM0_A3='ALD'] { polygon-fill:@red; } [ADM0_A3='AND'] { polygon-fill:@purple; } [ADM0_A3='ARE'] { polygon-fill:@green; } Those settings presuppose a lot of knowledge. In fact, the only way to determine those colors is to predetermine them. (I'm guessing these were taken from a paper map.) Manifold software, MapInfo, and others offer tools that automatically determine how to solve the 5-color problem: coloring polygons so that no two adjacent colors are the same. (In theory, it's the 4-color problem, but that's very mathematically intensive, and doesn't even look that good, so most of these solvers use 5 or 6 colors) For instance, here's some documentation from manifold http://georeference.org/doc/drawing_color.htm This sounds like it's beyond the scope of tilemill, since I suspect it's not aware of adjacency. But I figure: if I need a pretty, colorful map like Geography Class, I'd have to use one of the GIS systems to figure out the colors anyhow, in essence, creating a new column with a number reflecting the color. Trying to guess colors one at a time can work, but inevitably two adjacent polygons end up with the same colors... so it's a bit of a chase to do it manually.

Hello there, I just figured out that socket.emit (server->client) works fine for the JS date type, but when the response callback functionality is used (client->server->client), socket.io breaks the date by instantiating a new, empty object.

symfony_symfony_issues_30017,"Possible BC break introduce since v3.4.20
**Symfony version(s) affected**: v3.4.20 and v3.4.21 **Description** I'm not sure if it's a BC break in Symfony or a bad practice in Doctrine ORM (doctrine/orm:v2.5.14). Since the commit 0d0be12e07b1e04e4d87286dbeb1c64302dccbfa, if a service is attached to the lifecycle events of doctrine, the service is not called. Instead, doctrine try to implement a new instance of the service (without the arguments). **How to reproduce** Configure a service that is attached to a doctrine event:  **Additional context** By digging inside, I found that inside the `ListenersInvoker` of Doctrine, a _resolver_ has the responsibility to resolve the _class_ and _method_ attached to an event into an instance. Before v3.4.20, the resolver was an instance of `ContainerAwareEntityListenerResolver` which is capable of translating the class in the corresponding service. Since v3.4.20, it's a `DefaultEntityResolverListener` which only create a new instance of the class without arguments. It's a problem of timing. The resolver is not directly injected on the constructor of the `ListenersInvoker`. Instead, the `ListenersInvoker` receive the `doctrine.orm.configuration` from which it retrieve the resolver inside the constructor. But at this state, the `doctrine.orm.configuration` is not yet configured. The `doctrine.orm.configuration` service is configured by some setters. The fact is that since the v3.4.20, the setters are called after `ListenersInvoker::construct()`. So the `ListenersInvoker` don't have the good resolver.",Can you show your Doctrine related config for all environments?,Can you provide more information?

NodeRedis_node-redis_issues_628,"On Azure Redis - ECONNRESET - operations fail without reconnect attempt
I have a fairly straightforward implementation of redis working more or less as expected, with one major exception. In my production environment, using Microsoft Azure redis, there is a pretty bad failure mode. I'm using the actual Azure redis service (as opposed to running my own redis in an Azure VM or something). If I make a request after a few minutes of inactivity, it fails in the following way (I have debug_mode on, and everything not in square brackets below is console output): [client.get] send xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1: *2 $3 get $36 772e1696-e333-4adb-b04a-3e0e15d0cffa send_command buffered_writes: 0 should_buffer: false [20 seconds elapses] Redis connection to xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 failed - read ECONNRESET [client.get calls back with error: ""Error: Redis connection to xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 failed - read ECONNRESET""] [""error"" event fires: ""Error: Redis connection to xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 failed - read ECONNRESET""] Redis connection is gone from error event. [""end"" event fires] Retry connection in 255 ms Retrying connection... Stream connected xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1 Using default parser module: javascript Sending auth to xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1 send xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1: *2 $4 auth $44 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx= send_command buffered_writes: 0 should_buffer: false net read xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1: +OK Auth succeeded xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1 checking server ready state... send xxx.redis.cache.windows.net:6379 id 1: *1 So there is a bunch of stuff going on. The main issue is that there is a long wait time (10-20 seconds) on the attempted get, and then the get fails. Then for some reason it decides to wait some more before reconnecting, then the reconnect succeeds, but too late to be of any real use at that point (having already returned failure before ever attempting to reconnect). I specified Azure in the issue because when I do this same test with a local redis server (local meaning on a different dev machine on the LAN) and I force the server to drop the connection, the client code does exactly what you would expect (immediately responds to the reset connection and attempts reconnect, succeeding as soon as the server is back up). It might be worth noting that my local test redis server is running on Mac OS and the Azure redis server runs on Windows. My test environment is also running Node on Windows. In the Azure redis case, I can leave the client idle for 30 minutes (by which time I know the server has dropped the connection), but the client does not detect it (no reconnect attempt, no error or end callbacks, just nothing at all happening). Until I try to actually do something on the connection, in which case we have the long timeout and subsequent failure of the call. If it was just the failure to attempt reconnect, maybe I could work around it, but the 10-20 seconds of hanging around to figure out the connection has been reset before failing would make that approach a non-starter anyway.

olivere_elastic_issues_1290,"SetSniff Always uses IP Address Rather than CNAME
Please use the following questions as a guideline to help me answer your issue/question without further inquiry. Thank you. ### Which version of Elastic are you using? [X] elastic.v7 (for Elasticsearch 7.x) [X] elastic.v6 (for Elasticsearch 6.x) [ ] elastic.v5 (for Elasticsearch 5.x) [ ] elastic.v3 (for Elasticsearch 2.x) [ ] elastic.v2 (for Elasticsearch 1.x) ### Please describe the expected behavior When elastic.SetSniff(true) and the ES server is configured to send an http.publish_address of the form: ""publish_address"": ""some.server.com/127.0.0.1:9200"" I would expect the client library to use the published CNAME (""some.server.com"") when communicating with the node rather than the IP address. If TLS is enabled on the ES server nodes, even with elastic.SetScheme('https'), we run into problems communicating with the TLS enabled nodes as the server certificate is tied to the CNAME rather than the IP address. Unless we pass in an HTTP Client with TLS configured to InsecureSkipVerify, communication with the sniff'd nodes will fail. ### Please describe the actual behavior The IP address is used for communicating withe the sniff'd nodes. ### Any steps to reproduce the behavior? As the CNAME/IP:PORT form is the default in ElasticServer 7+, running a local ES 7+ is the easiest way to replicate the behavior. By enabling SetSniff, we can see that the elastic client reports having discovered a node in the cluster. For example: ""elastic: http://127.0.0.1:9200 joined the cluster"" It appears the behavior stems from the extractHostname() function in client.go, specifically at line 1009-1011. If a '/' is found, the address post-slash is used as the hostname by the client. Believe that the following diff would change the behavior to allow for extracting the CNAME instead of the IP address and using that: [client.go.patch.txt](https://github.com/olivere/elastic/files/4247041/client.go.patch.txt)",Would that serve your needs?,How do you enforce that behaviour? ,Does this help?,Can you share a code snippet?,"Do you have a test case, I mean, actual code, so that I can reproduce what and where the problem exactly happens?",Why do you think this is a memory leak?,What do you think ?,Did you try to enable gzip?,Could you try with the latest version: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana and https://www.elastic.co/downloads/x-pack?,Did you try the describeInstances with AWS cli? https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html Is the output same or different from Java SDK output?,How do you enforce that behaviour?

laravel_framework_issues_1235,"[Bug ?] ""created"" event not working as excepted.
Hi, I wanted to update an object with the ""created"" event (the update needs to have the object's id, so the object must exists in the database). The problem is in model.php > save: if ($this->exists) { $saved = $this->performUpdate($query); } else { $saved = $this->performInsert($query); $this->exists = $saved; } The ""created"" event is fired with ""PerformInsert"", when $this->exists is still false. So when my custom update want to save the object, Laravel sees that ($this->exists == false) and tries to reinsert it instead of updating it (and it fails, since the primary key is the same). $this->exists = $saved; should be in performInsert, just before $this->fireModelEvent('created', false); ?

Hi, Recently I tried this plugin in IntelliJ and I was very handly to run single test class or a single test case in a Test file. However I am unable to run a test if the surefire plugin is configured to run in integration-test phase of Maven. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a Maven project and configure surefire plugin or failsafe plugin to run the test in integration-test phase instead of test phase. Normally this is used for test modules containing integration tests 2) Create a test class in the test source folder 3) Open the file in IntelliJ 4) Right click in the editor and select ""Run Maven -> Test SomeSampleIntegrationTest"" Expected result: Maven build should run and execute the test class Actual result: Maven build successfully, however the test class is not run as the test is configured to run in integration-test phase of maven Proposed solution: When we right click in the editor, users can be given two options under ""Run Maven"": 1) Test SomeSampleIntegrationTest 2) Integration Test SomeSampleIntegrationTest Selecting the second option, should execute till integration-test phase of maven.

Both are exported as DW_TAG_formal_parameter at the moment which means it's impossible for a debugger to distinguish between them. Unfortunately there isn't anything (AFAICT) in DWARF v4 that matches the way go does things. Possible solutions: ### Export them as DW_TAG_variable The debugger can then tell which variables are output parameters by looking at the offset from frame base. Cons: it's a (small) abuse of DW_TAG_variable. ### Set DW_AT_variable_parameter The debugger can use this flag to tell which formal parameters are output parameters.

flyway_flyway_issues_2801,"Documentation for ""mixed"" config setting is misleading
The documentation for the ""mixed"" config setting is misleading. It says: [emphasis mine] To me that says that if I turn on the ""mixed"" setting, flyway will never run a migration in a transaction. But testing that out, it still ran a simple migration in a transaction. Doing on a search on github issues, it seems this setting turns on a mode where flyway tries to guess whether the migration script should not automatically be wrapped in a transaction based on the presence of certain statements in the script. Is this correct? I didn't see that in the docs. I don't want flyway to guess whether a script should be wrapped in a transaction or not. I would like to disable automatic transactions for all migration scripts and leave it up to the scripts to use transactions. I see that you can disable the automatic transaction on a script-by-script basis with a `<script_name>.conf` file that contains `executeInTransaction=false`. But that has to be done for *every* script. Is there any way to disable automatic transactions for *all* migrations without having to create a .conf file for every migration script? ###### Which version and edition of Flyway are you using?

jquery_jquery-mobile_issues_7671,"In hybrid build for iOS, popup links reload index.html
This was an insidious bug to figure out. I have a workaround but this seems like a serious one to fix. ## Issue description I'm using JQM solely for popup menus in a hybrid app. When the app is built into a native iOS app, and _only when index.html is loaded from within the archive_, clicking on buttons that open JQM popups causes a clone of the main page, without styling, to be loaded and superimposed on the page (in my case and probably most cases rendering the app useless). So for example:  This fixes the problem completely on iOS native builds, with the minor annoyance that now when loaded from a browser (any OS), a similar but not quite as bad broken behavior will occur if browsing to the / directory without the index.html. The button will cause the page to reload with the explicit filename in that case, after which everything works normally. ## Test page I can't provide a test page. My app is not open source and the problem is only reproducible when packaged as a native iOS app (I have seen it occur in both PhoneGap and Cocoon builds). I am happy to provide additional info or troubleshoot my working case if needed. ## Platforms/browsers (including version) and devices tested Problem seen on iPad 2, running iOS 7.1.1, inside a Cocoon WebView build and in a separate Cordova build. The same code checkout does _not_ show the bug if run from iOS Safari on the same device, or from a Cocoon Launcher app on same device, that loads the HTML/JS/CSS from a remote URL.

sdkman_sdkman-cli_issues_308,"Ubuntu 14.10, lightdm, .profile and gvm-init.sh not compatible
The line added to the end of .profile by gvm: [[ -s ""/home/clh/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh"" ]] && source ""/home/clh/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh"" is not interpretable by sh, only by bash (due to the [[ and also the ""source""). Lightdm on Ubuntu (at least in current 14.10) uses sh to interpret .profile and therefore kacks (popup during login complains of ""[["" not found) on that line. changing the [[ ... ]] to ""test"" and changing ""source"" to ""."" makes lightdm really kack (login fails with no diagnostic and returns to the lightm greeter)... so my current workaround is  which of course means gvm-init.sh is not invoked... at least not by lightdm, if that was indeed the intention. I guess another possibility might be to put the line in .bash_profile rather than .profile... to me this seems a reasonable thing to do since it is clear that only bash is meant to invoke .bashrc. Notes: 1) I originally posted this in the wrong spot, thanks for the correction Marco; 2) there is considerable dispute as to whether lightdm is meant to interpret .profile or not. for what it's worth, after having thought about it for awhile, I don't think it should; I think that terminal windows are meant to interpret .profile (or of course an RS232 console). but anyway there is some doubt about this over on launchpad.net and plenty of folk are arguing that it should be disabled in lightdm.",What version of wget do you have?

partkeepr_PartKeepr_issues_706,"PK v1.0 scrambles User Interface w/ Edit dialog
![screen shot 2016-08-05 at 11 26 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5227989/17436278/3c15d46c-5b16-11e6-8135-91ebaeb51a5d.png) This is a situation the UI snaps into with the following steps: Navigate to an existing part in DB, double-click on it's row to open that record in Edit dialog. Then modify the location of that part to another existing Storage Location. Nothing else, no other fields touched. Then a click on Save would grey out that button, but instead of closing (removing) the part's record edit dialog within a few seconds it renders the Save button solid again. Like it was before the click on it a few seconds back. This happens in FF (47.0.1 and 48.0) as well as Safari, for the 3rd time in total here. After scrambling the UI like above, it is possible to leave that displaced edit dialog with hit on ESC. Then, UI seems to be okay again, until next double-click on a random part. The edit dialog won't be an overlay anymore in this user session, it would render constantly to the lower end of the page, moving everything else upwards as you can see. In state of scambled UI (as seen in the image) the Edit section (partly) carries random field values on display. In this example the 330 µF cap never hasn't been in storage location Rack 1 Box 04. Although visually the Save action seems to work (without removing the dialog though), the update query statement to the DB won't reach the DB or at least won't get committed. After page reload and subsequent fresh login the part in focus has still it's old storage location. This issue isn't crucial -- once user's aware of the impact it has, then he or she can deal with it.

tpope_vim-fugitive_issues_166,"Searching for a way to modify multiple branches simultaneously
I've got a bit of an odd use case and I'm trying to find a way to make it work... the way I've been doing isn't scaling, from a development perspective. I'm working on some documentation using LaTeX. The doc is a set of LaTeX files and Ive got a program I'm using as a vehicle for explanation through out the doc. As the doc moves ahead though chapters, the sample app evolves - i.e. we keep modifying it. The doc has some ""includes"" in it that pull bits and pieces of the working code into the doc so LaTeX can process it. I'm desperately trying to avoid copying the code from the source files into the document directly for obvious reasons. But the continually evolving code is another problem. I've been creating copies in the source tree and modifying it there, creating multiple generations of the code, but this isn't scaling either, for obvious reasons. It makes a hell of a lot more sense to put the generational code in branches - i.e. chapter1, chapter2, etc... Then pulling the snippets of code into the book should be easy using ""git show branch:file"" instead of a straight file read. But... now the document is a problem. I want to be able to view the entire document all the time and edit it all the time. The best workflow i can think of for this at the moment is to have N+1 branches. One for the book itself - this is the branch that my build script will be running on all the time, rebuilding the PDF every time I make a change. The N branches will be for the generations of the code. But... editing the code and the book at the same time is a serious pain in the butt. Is there a way for the ""branch"" to be buffer local or (insert better definition here)? When I write the file from the book buffer, it writes to the appropriate branch and likewise for the code (i.e. it does the checkout / write automatically). Failing this, I can look for another way to solve my problem, but this idea has the virtue of keeping the ""git-ness"" out of my face while I work.","Does that sound reasonable?

ValveSoftware_halflife_issues_1680,"Testing with lots of simulated players?
If someone wants to test a Half-Life mod with lots of players, what are their options? My mod has a very old build of a third party bot program (""gravebot""). I can use it, but it doesn't mesh well with my mod and it might give me problems. So... if I want to go further down this path I need to update gravebot in order to do my testing. **Not ideal.** Bots in general are hard to work with for testing. They don't behave like real players: there are fundamental differences in things like their edict/entity representation. **Not ideal.** If I want to have multiple _real_ players, I need to ask a bunch of people on steam to give up their time and join my game. I have to make sure they use the right client build for my test (and I can't ever really be sure they did). **Not ideal.** Is there a way I can make lots of real players (not bots, not using third party code) join my server to test something?

Right now names on aerialway=station are rendered at z=14 in blue, while the ones of aerialways are at z=17 in grey/black. There is a number of problems: - At z=17 on a laptop screen even chairlifts of average length don't fit on the screen completely at all. If the name is rendered once only, you have to drag the map along the aerialway to find it. - The font is weak, especially being rendered over landuse=forest, which happens. It could be much more highlighting, as aerialways in skiing resorts barely cover any other objects around (while stations located in villages do) . - By that, the rendering still provides the wrong tagging method naming aerialways on their stations than on themselves.

certbot_certbot_issues_7826,"Output always says ""cert not due for renewal"", ""No renewals were attempted"" even when it does renew
## My operating system is (include version): Debian 10.2 ## I installed Certbot with (certbot-auto, OS package manager, pip, etc): I don't remember. How can I find out? ## I ran this command and it produced this output: On 2020-02-23, this command was run by a cronjob and I received the output via email:  So, it says that the certificate is not due for renewal and that no renewal was attempted. Now, on 2020-02-29 I have run the same command from the CLI manually and got this output:  ## Certbot's behavior differed from what I expected because: Note that the expiration date has changed. That is, on feb 23 it was supposedly not due for renewal and it was supposedly not renewed, yet on feb 29 automagically the expiration date has changed and hence it is still not due for renewal. This makes no sense. In one of the two instances, the output that says ""no renewals were attempted"" is bullshit. In either one of the two instances, the certificate was renewed. By inspecting /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log, it appears that when it ran on feb 23, it did in fact renew the certificate:  And indeed by visiting my website in Chrome and looking at the certificate information, I see it was issued on feb 23 and expires on may 24. So, the script systematically outputs ""cert not due for renewal"" and ""no renewals were attempted"" regardless of whether or not that is the case. It works correctly in detecting when the certificate needs to be renewed and in renewing it, but if the output is not reliable it's like having no output. Actually, it's worse than having no output, because you think that you are getting information when you are not. This, in addition to the fact that when you create a new certificate with some of the same domains but some more domains added to it, you keep receiving expiration emails from LetsEncrypt about the old certificate, makes everything a mess where you never know what the **** is going on and end up having to check everything manually. Which defeats the purpose of having notification emails. ## Here is a Certbot log showing the issue (if available): ###### Logs are stored in /var/log/letsencrypt by default. Feel free to redact domains, e-mail and IP addresses as you see fit. ## Here is the relevant nginx server block or Apache virtualhost for the domain I am configuring:",Can you share the output of pip freeze?

aws_aws-sdk-js_issues_977,"Getting ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"" in the web inspector console even when network logs a successful request
Hi, I'm using the 2.3.5 version of the AWS Javascript SDK. When I run:  From inspecting the stack trace, it seems to be caused by there being no body of the response (thus response.body.length fails). However, when I inspect my network logs, I get back a JSON returning {IdentityId: 'MY_IDENTITY_ID'}, so it seems like the request was successful. ^ Similar thing happens when I call cognitoidentity.getOpenIdToken(params), posting the id token returned from the cognitoidentity.getId(params) call above, and when I take the token returned from the cognitoidentity.getOpenIdToken(params) call and post it to sts.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity (the only difference here is that when I inspect the logs for the STS call, the content-type request headers are 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and the request returns XML, versus the two CognitoIdentity calls which have content-type request headers of 'application/x-amz-json-1.1'). I'm not clear on how I can 1) get back the response I observe in the network logs so I can use the data from it - when I pass in a callback to return data, no data is returned from my request; and 2) how can I understand and prevent the error triggered by there appearing to be no body of the response (or whatever may be causing ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"")?

stacktracejs_stacktrace.js_issues_26,"Errors trapped in window.onerror lacks stacktrace
I tested this in at least Firefox and Chrome, and the stack trace is completely uninformative if called from window.onerror. I guess this makes sense, since by the time the error has reached the onerror handler, the stack has already been unrolled and discarded. Since there's no error object that can be used, printStackTrace creates it's own error object. Since this is now the new point where the error has been thrown, and since no previous stack trace is available anyway, the stack trace is now filled with only stack frames from within the stacktrace.js function. If I'm doing something something wrong and don't know about it, please let me know.

saltstack_salt_issues_14856,"file.symlink default behavior for user/group permissions
I have a situation where some paths are mounted via NFS into a virtual machine using Vagrant. One of the characteristics of such a shared filesystem is that the uid:gid seems to be immutable from within my guest VM without at least some sort of hack/workaround. If I have a state set up to create a symlink, e.g.:  I took a look at the [source for the file state](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.1.10/salt/states/file.py#L823-L832) and I see that even if the `user` and `group` options are not provided for the state it will default them and attempt to set ownership anyway. Should this really be the desired behavior? I think that either: 1. it should not try to set the ownership unless values are provided or 2. some option should exist to tell it to skip setting ownership Right now my only alternative is to set these symlinks up in a shell script instead of managing them in my Salt states.","Do you believe this is related to the way the formula operates, or how you have the users configured?

sinatra_sinatra_issues_1119,"StatsD reporting of specific sinatra routes
Hi, I would like to report metrics for specific sinatra routes to statsd and then graphite. For the route GET /users/:uid I would like to report to a metric name `request.get.users.uid` The uid in the metric name cannot be the actual variable value since it is not a good practice to insert a variable into a graphite metric name. For each route I would like to count response codes and execution time. I tried to create a middleware to do that and saw that sinatra inserts a `sinatra.route` into the Rack env hash which I can use to get the request method and pattern a request was processed by.  The problem is that if I have a halt somewhere in a before filter that variable (sinatra.route) is not set in the Rack env hash so I'm missing the details I need in order to create the metric name.

I'm importing products from XML files. I've got my custom module that gathers the information from the XML file into arrays and passes the data to the AvS import module.

What I mean is, that in the XML file I've described a product in a wrong way, on purpose, to test that the importer will contrinue importing even if a fault occurs. Lets say I've got 6 products and ~3 is the false one (which never gets imported and it has to be like that). Then ~4 will also not get imported (and that is a wrong behaviour which occured after the latest update of the module). Then the rest of the products are imported correctly.

This is not nullable because all files need to belong to a valid user. - `lastDownloadedBy` (OneToOne `User`, nullable): because for some reason we want to keep track of who last downloaded a file. This may be null in case nobody downloaded the file yet. A `User` only has one field: - `lastUploadedFile` (OneToOne `UploadedFile`, nullable): stores the last file the user uploaded, or null if the user didn't upload a file yet From the above mapping it can be seen that the `User` must be inserted before the `UploadedFile` can be inserted: no `UploadedFile` can exist without a `User`. In my test case, a `User` and an `UploadedFile` are created, and all fields are populated. Then, `$em->persist()` is called on the `UploadedFile` and then the `User`. During the `$em->flush()`, Doctrine will try to insert the `UploadedFile` first, which will fail (because the `owner` field is set to `NULL` since the `User` is not inserted yet,) causing an exception. #### How to reproduce <!-- Provide steps to reproduce the bug. If possible, also add a code snippet with relevant configuration, entity mappings, DQL etc. Adding a failing Unit or Functional Test would help us a lot - you can submit one in a Pull Request separately, referencing this bug report. --> The test case mentioned above can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/AssortedParrot/doctrine-incorrect-commit-order). To reproduce it, clone the repository, run `composer install` and then run `php test.php`. It will create a SQLite database in the current directory, create the schema and then try to insert a `User` and an `UploadedFile` object into the database. The SQL logs show that Doctrine is trying to `INSERT` the `UploadedFile` object first, which fails. It will then roll back the transaction and throw an exception. #### Expected behavior <!-- What was the expected (correct) behavior? --> I would expect the following behavior: - Insert the `User` object first (with the `lastUploadedFile` field set to `NULL`) - Insert the `UploadedFile` object (the `owner` field can now be set to the ID of the `User` we just inserted) - Update the `User` object (set `lastUploadedFile` to the ID of the `UploadedFile` we just inserted) ### Additional information It should be noted that I found many small things that, when changed, caused Doctrine to exhibit the expected behavior: - Changing the order in which the `owner` and `lastDownloadedBy` fields in the `UploadedFile` entity are defined - Changing the order of the two `$em->persist()` - Changing the `lastDownloadedBy` field to *not* nullable I believe this has something to do with the way the `CommitOrderCalculator` traverses the entity graph - changing the order of the fields or of the persist calls might cause it to walk the edges in a different order, resulting in a different commit order. Changing the nullability of the fields affects the weight that is assigned to the edges, which also has an effect on the commit order. However, I don't quite understand [this part](https://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/0c2ccec9151fd0b44a60f9cc149e2a107d380799/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Internal/CommitOrderCalculator.php#L143), so I was not able to investigate this further.

embree_embree_issues_149,"Stream traversal inconsistent results
I am trying to implement Embree in a production renderer. One of the desired features is lazy loading, which I cant get to work correctly in Embree stream traversal mode. What I noticed during my debugging process is that the stream traverser seems to return slightly different results every time (when running the same executable multiple times in single threaded mode). I was able to confirm this problem by copying the rays, executing rtcIntersect() in a for loop and comparing the results (in our renderer). The problem seems to be easily reproducible by modifying the stream viewer tutorial. I replaced the following code (around line 160 of viewer_stream_device.cpp):  I also attached the modified file for your convenience: [viewer_stream.tar.gz](https://github.com/embree/embree/files/1264507/viewer_stream.tar.gz) When you start looking and moving around, the viewer will start to output ""rtcIntersect1M did not return the same values as rtcIntersect"" indicating that the stream traverser returned something different than the single ray traverser. Replacing the for loop by another call to rtcIntersect1M actually has the same problem, which shows that multiple calls to rtcIntersect1M on a copy of the data will return different results.

pymc-devs_pymc3_issues_2146,"Best way to use a precalculated prior defined as a PMF on a lattice
Hi! I have a prior distribution for one of my continuous variables in a form of an an array containing probability mass function for intervals on a discretized lattice. For example, it might be a precalculated kernel density estimation or a pre-calculated mixture of large number of components. It doesn't matter where the distribution came from, the main idea is that it is ""smooth enough"" and that the lattice step size can be as small as necessary. There is a need to use this prior in a PyMC3 model. What would be the best way to accomplish it? My plan is to use `DensityDist` with a custom Theano operation that * calculates probability density at each point using values from the lattice array; * calculates gradient using finite differentiation on the lattice. Is it a feasible approach? How sensitive NUTS sampler is to possible gradient discontinuities? If it is, could it be mitigated by adding something like spline interpolation?

spring-projects_spring-security_issues_8407,"Add ROLE_INFRASTRUCTURE to infrastructure beans
**Describe the bug** I get info logs during application startup, that a couple of Beans are not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors. I am using Spring Boot 2.2.6.RELEASE. I thought, this was Spring Boot concerned, so I already created a ticket there but got sent over here. [Link](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/21000) to the Spring Boot issue.  Since this leads to proxying problems, some method level security annotations are being ignored, which leads to unsecured endpoints at runtime. However I think that seeing this logs messages at application start is already a bug, since there shouldn't be any problems with BeanPostProcessors, because nothing custom is defined. **To Reproduce** Use `@EnableGloabeMethodSecurity` and have spring-data-jpa in the project. When you then start your web applications, you get the before mentioned log messages. **Expected behavior** I expect none of the before mentioned log messages at application start. **Sample** I created this [minimal, reproducible sample](https://github.com/Lyannic/enable-global-method-security-bug-demo) which basically consists of nothing, but the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation and the needed dependencies.",Can you update the sample to demonstrate how your beans are not being proxied properly?,Would you like to submit a pull request (see link in README for contributor's agreement)?,Can you please share one without jhipster?,Can you please provide a small sample that reproduces the problem?,How do you expect the Framework to know which `ConnectionFactory` to inject?,Do you see exceptions in your console?

golang_go_issues_28740,"x/tools/go/packages: include directness information to ParseFile callback
Wire [recently switched to go/packages](https://github.com/google/go-cloud/pull/623) after using golang.org/x/tools/go/loader. As noted in google/go-cloud#663, we observed a ~4x slowdown. Since not all of the time is spent inside the Wire process, profiling has been difficult. However, for a baseline Wire run that took 2.26s (originally 0.3s), half the time is spent in go list, the other half is spent in go/types.dependencyGraph and map assignments. This indicates to me that at least part of the problem still is having too much input being sent to the typechecker. One of the tricks Wire employed in the loader-based code was to skip function bodies for dependency packages (Wire needs function body type-checking for the root packages). However, the ParseFile callback does not give enough information to make this determination. I would like for the arguments to ParseFile to include whether the file is being parsed for the root packages or imported packages. Something like:  It does seem quite possible that more information could be added over time, so a more future-friendly change could be along the lines of: ",Can you replicate the same regression from 1.7 to 1.8 to tip using testing.B instead of time.Now?

processing_p5.js_issues_80,"Modules: require.js (+ grunt)?
I noticed that you are working on a single, long file (pjs.js) that will grow even more, I guess. Maybe you are concatenating shorter files together, on your computers? Anyway, I would suggest to consider the possibility to use Require.js and split the library in separate modules to make maintenance and dev process a bit simpler. Grunt would help to automagically build an optimized pjs.js file, every time you save changes to a module (ie. any .js file)! The modules/folders/files structure could be something like this (based on the current library structure), just as an example:  I am available to help setting up Require and Grunt for you in separate folders, if you are interested. The downside is that if you decide to use Require, you will need to change a bit the way global objects are managed and organize dependencies inside the library. It could be a bit boring, but once done it would make the code even more robust for the future, I think.

netty_netty_issues_4052,"HTTP/2 FlowController and flushing
Netty Version: 5.0.0.Alpha3-SNAPSHOT (latest from master). Issue: When my server sends a larger HTTP response to a client (chrome), the client receives most of the response and then hangs. Once the connection is closed, the client receives the rest of the response and completes processing. I think the problem stems from the `FlowController` which writes frames out and respects `channelWritability` changes. I believe the FlowController should be issuing a `ctx.flush()`, but at what point, I am unsure of... maybe from `channelWritabilityChanged`? An easy way to reproduce this is: 1) create an SSL HTTP/2 server (that converts HTTP/1.x responses to HTTP/2 Frames) 2) when the server processes a request, create a `FullHttpResponse` with a decent sized body (this should be ~100KB - I used jquery.js) 3) send the response with `ctx.write` (`ctx.writeAndFlush()` should have the same outcome, I haven't tried though) 4) If you sent the response with `ctx.write`, override the `channelReadComplete` method and issue a `ctx.flush()` from there. The browser should receive part of the response and then just hang until the connection (or stream?) is closed. Upon closure the rest of the response is received. This is because netty issues another `flush` when the connection closes. If you need a reproducer I have one, just let me know where I should mail it to :)","Can you check it?

Context: I work for http://weave.works. A user of our product reported an issue with reverse DNS at https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues/2157 - Docker DNS is giving an answer which break's the user's Kerberos. Weave provides a DNS server that has a few different features to Docker's DNS - it resolves the hostname for instance, and it allows the user to put containers in different DNS subdomains. For forward lookups we can ensure that Docker DNS doesn't answer by choosing a domain that doesn't match a network name. For reverse lookups of container addresses, however, Docker DNS will answer first, and give an answer that doesn't match the forward lookup.

saltstack_salt_issues_8521,"Active Directory Service Integration / Improvements
As requested by @basepi in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8119, I'm re-opening this issue as a feature request. I am currently adding/updating/deleting entries from DNS and DHCP using netsh and dnscmd using the remote command execution framework and run states. The salt-minion executing these commands requires the minion service to be started as a privileged A/D user. Updates are complicated since netsh/dnscmd do not support ""updates"" directly, so I need to first determine if an update is required and then delete the current entry in DNS and DHCP before adding its replacement. This requires some set logic to compare the current state of all of my hosts/VMs with what's in DNS and DHCP. I will likely do this in memory from within python to start with (using dictionaries as hash tables perhaps) but will eventually move the set subtraction to redis probably. It would be very helpful if we had functions in salt that provided add, delete and update/modify semantics for both DNS and DHCP in A/D. Other A/D integration features like user management, user lookup (with member-of group lookups - including nested groups), etc.. would also be helpful but are secondary to anything I need at the moment.",Does this only occur with windows?,What does `c:\salt\var\log\salt\minion` say about the failure?,Would that suffice?,What is your use case for dlopen-ing a lib that calls GoogleDefaultCredentials?,Would you be able to submit this as a PR along with some integration or unit tests?

yiisoft_yii_issues_1059,"CHttpRequest::requestUri missing some get parameters?
Hi, I suspect I hit some bug. Here is the background followed by the bug description: In the example use case, there's a login 'block' embedded as a widget in a layout, and therefore appears in all pages of the site. Once, the user logs in, I want him to stay at the same URL. Disregarding the internal design of the involved moving parts, in the method that processes the login request, I need to change Yii::app()->user->returnUrl to reflect the current url just after a successful login has been performed and just before a redirect is done (a redirect is not strictly needed but the suspected bug was discovered while a redirect was done). The test login was done on the following URL: http://mysite/articles/basicGrid?sort=author&Article_page=2&ajax=article-grid&**sdfsd=3223432** Now, when used the following first construct to return to the 'current' URL: _Yii::app()->user->returnUrl = Yii::app()->request->requestUri_ the last GET parameter (in bold above), which is a gibberish of course, was not returned and included in the URL. Its as if when some internal part of Yii doesn't recognize a GET parameter it is removed from requestUri, although the requestUri should have included all query string. When I changed it to: _Yii::app()->user->returnUrl = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']_ the original url was revisited as intended. What do you think?

cocos2d_cocos2d-html5_issues_2364,"Need a method to reset the entire cocos2d engine
I am using Meteor and I found a serious issue with cocos2d-js at the moment. Most of the new JavaScript frameworks such as Meteor and Angular.js will use client side routing system. It means when the user navigates from one page to the other page, the page doesn't hard load the entire HTML. It may use something like ajax to retrieve the content and dynamically update the DOM without reloading the entire HTML again. It comes a problem with cocos2d-js in that case. cocos2d-js has a global variable called `cc`. If the browser reloads the entire HTML, all javascript files (or cached files) will be reloaded (re-executed), the variable `cc` will be re-init again. But if we use some Javascript frameworks like Meteor or Angular.js. the variable `cc` will remain the same. And when we try to init the game (another game in the second page) by using `cc.game.run('gameCanvas');`. Some of properties (for instance, `_setupCalled`) had been set before (when we inited the first game). And we can't start the game on the new page because `_setupCalled` is true. Cocos2d can't setup the Canvas properly. I have tried to wrapped all the source code in one `init()` method, and call this method in document.ready() method. The code is open source on https://github.com/JakeLin/cocos2d-meteor It seams working, but I get another issue with `cc.game.setFrameRate(30)`. Every time, I call this method, the FPS will decrease about half. For example, the first game is 30, the second game is 15, the third one is 10, the forth one is 7.5.

tpope_vim-fugitive_issues_210,"vim-fugitive can cause vim to load very slowly under cygwin
When vim is started in a directory that does not have a git repository, it appears the vim-fugitive starts to climb the directory hierarchy looking for a git repository and examining the contents of each directory until it can climb no further.

rgeo_rgeo_issues_218,"Different Validation Behavior (is_simple) in Geos 3.8.x
RGeo has different exception throwing behavior and returns different `is_simple` values when backed by different versions of the underlying `geos` library. Specifically the `RGeo::Geographic.simple_mercator_factory` will throw an exception when parsing a self intersecting ""hour glass"" polygon in `3.8` while it will parse that polygon and return `#is_simple?` `true` in `3.7`. I think this is the root cause of this stackoverflow issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58996305/getting-invalidgeometry-linearring-failed-ring-test-after-upgrading-rgeo-gem ### Steps to reproduce With `geos-config --version` `3.8.1`:  This is a self-intersecting ""hour glass"" polygon: <img width=""303"" alt=""geojson_io"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2358067/79137760-ecc36f80-7d78-11ea-96bc-0918884ac2ce.png""> ### Expected behavior With `geos-config --version` `3.5.2`, `3.6.4`, or `3.7.4` (built from tarball with cmake): This Polygon will be parsed. It returns `true` for `#is_simple?`. ### Actual behavior `RGeo::Error::InvalidGeometry (LinearRing failed ring test)` ### System configuration **Ruby version**: `ruby 2.5.7p206 (2019-10-01 revision 67816) [x86_64-darwin18]` **OS**: `Darwin jdalt-mbp.local 18.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Thu Jan 23 06:52:12 PST 2020; root:xnu-4903.278.25~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64` Also replicated on travis-ci with Ubuntu xenial with a `geos` 3.8.1 built from source/tarball. `rgeo` is version `2.1.1` ### Speculation I think this is a difference in how `is_simple` is calculated in the CAPI. I believe all factories that use the `CAPI` to calculate `is_simple` are affected. I don't think the behavior of `RGeo::Geographic.spherical_factory` is affected. ### Additional Thoughts This is a breaking change, but for my own purposes I prefer the new behavior. I like it because it's more consistent with the implementation of `RGeo::Geographic.spherical_factory` which I converted my app to in order to avoid the issues outlined in https://github.com/rgeo/rgeo/issues/212. I tried #213 but it caused too much of a performance degradation to be viable for me. However, I can't easily upgrade the underlying library in my production environment, so I'd like to get more insight into what's happening and what other mitigation options might be available to me. Ideally I'd be able to induce the 3.8 behavior in earlier versions of the library, or I'd be alerted to some other factory that's performant and consistent across versions. I think others need to be aware that there are serious, breaking changes that exist in `geos` `3.8.x`. This will become the default version of the library in Ubuntu `focal`.

The [compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on) says However, there is no warning when using `docker stack deploy` with a compose file using `depends_on`. it seems to me this feature is pretty important for a declarative approach to service deployment and orchestration. It is a pretty common requirement that some services should only be started after others(and only if those dependencies are successfully deployed). It is also non-trivial for application developers to handle this on top of swarm. The only way I can see is using something like [`wait-for-it`](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it) scripts for all services in the dependency graph, which would require implementing custom images for each service, which can add operational complexity(we would need to maintain more custom images, and keep them up to day with the base images). **Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):** **Output of `docker version`:** ",Can you show the content of your docker unit-file?

Hi, I have been using this gem for several years without any issues. However, it appears I have now stumbled upon a corner case, which the library is not able to handle. Namely, if one HTTP request receives duplicate responses (instead of one, which is normal), the following crash will occur:  This is probably a result of misconfiguration on someone's server (returning 2 responses) but still, maybe there is a better way to handle this situation instead of crashing? I tested some other HTTP libraries and they seemed to work fine with this type of response, simply discarding the second part. For me this is a rather serious issue since I'm using this library within a thin web server.

scikit-learn_scikit-learn_issues_4503,"DBSCAN: Smaller eps value and bigger clusters?
Hi, I am experiencing a somewhat weird behavior when using DBSCAN, the haversine metric and relatively small values for eps. In particular if I call DBSCAN with these arguments 1: `db = DBSCAN(eps=1.567855942887398e-06, min_samples=3, metric='haversine', algorithm=""ball_tree"").fit(x)` I get smaller clusters than if I call DBSCAN with these arguments 2: `db = DBSCAN(eps=1.567855942887398e-07, min_samples=3, metric='haversine', algorithm=""ball_tree"").fit(x)` If I map the clusters, they also look much more dispersed for the smaller eps value. This is a very counter-intuitive behavior, in my humble opinion. It almost feels like I hit a lower-bound for eps values, and indeed much bigger values for eps work as expected. For example, a much larger value for eps as in: 3: `db = DBSCAN(eps=0.0001567855942887398 , min_samples=3, metric='haversine', algorithm=""ball_tree"").fit(x)` produces the results that I would expect. In particular, 3 produces much bigger clusters than 1. Shouldn't the clusters become smaller if you decrease the eps parameter? Does anybody have any idea what's going on? Also, I am on `Ubuntu 12.04` with `Python 2.7.3` and `scikit-learn 0.15.2` and I am happy to triage some more if anybody points me where to start looking.","Can you share your data or even better, reproduce with synthetic data?",Do you have a stand-alone snippet reproducing the problem?

micronucleus_micronucleus_issues_77,"Trouble uploading on windows 10
Hi, I have 2 digisparks with micronucleus v1.11 on them. When I try to use the micronucleus commandline tool to update either one of them, they are not found and nothing happens, the device goes to the user program after 5 seconds (preloaded with blink sketch). In those 5 seconds, the device is found by windows (I installed the drivers with zadig and/or digistump installer), but somehow the commandline tool can't see the device. I took one of the devices to a windows 7 machine, installed the driver with zadig, downloaded the micronucleus repo, created a toolchain to build a v2 bootloader, built the v2 bootloader and flashed it to the device using the micronucleus commandline tool. So, the device works at least, yay! Back to the windows 10 machine. No user program, so the device stays in micronucleus mode and windows sees the device (Device manager shows it, Zadig shows it), but when I start, for instance, micronucleus --erase-only and then plug-in the device, nothing happens.

symphonycms_selectbox_link_field_issues_86,"Datasource-grouping only works for first associated section
### I have the following scenario: - One ""**Images**""-section is used to manage all images of two other sections ""**Projects**"" and ""**News**"". - The entries in the ""**Images**""-section are associated to a single entry of on of these two ""parent""-sections. I use a (hidden) SBL-field called ""entry"" for that. - I have a datasource called ""images"" that pulls all the images for the currently needed entries. - On specific fronted pages I have to show images for multiple entries, so I want to group the entries in the ""images""-datasource by their parent-entry. ### This results in the following buggy behavior: - The image-entries associated to entries of the first parent-section ""**Projects**"" show up as expected in the datasource (grouped by parent-entry). - The image-entries associated to entries of the second parent-section ""**News**"" simply disappear. As soon as I turn off grouping all expected image-entries (of both parent-sections) are included in the datasource again. I also tried switching to a more fancy name than ""entry"" for the SBL-field - doesn't do a difference.

Polymer_tools_issues_1143,"Should the transform middleware bind to the response object (OutgoingMessage)?
This is a tentative issue in that I am not actually trying this in Polyserve at the moment, but it does seem wrong. I have taken a much bastardised version of this code to implement the on the fly transform in my own application which is using the http2 npm module to provide a server. this http2 module provides a number of prototype extensions to OutgoingMessage, The transform middleware replaces `response.write` and `response.end` with some local functions and in certain circumstances they call the replaced function, passing in a `this` value. This ultimately causes the http2 module throw an error saying that a routine it is trying to use is undefined. My solutions to this have been two approaches. Originally I uses the `response` itself in place of `this` when I called `_write` and `_end` (the saved original routines), but I am currently defining the new function with a `.bind(response)` tacked on the end. By doing this it is mostly working - I am trying to get it to also work with pushing stuff and I am getting occasional ""Cant remove headers after they are sent"", but that is another issue I think.","What's your Emacs and OS versions?

PrestaShop_ganalytics_issues_66,"ganalytics affecting PayPal currency during checkbox
Hi guys, When checking out an order with a different currency currency, the currency gets changed to the default but the amount is unchanged. For example, an order of $15.41 should convert to £9.99 in PayPal, but instead converts to £15.41. I know this seems completely unrelated, but I have found this issue only goes away and reoccurs when enabling / disabling ganalytics 2.x. I believe this has something to do with the PayPal module updating the customers cart before payment, which in turn triggers a hook Google Analytics uses, overwriting the currency change. I'm not sure though, I have not been able to pinpoint the issue. I replied to a post about this in April, and there are others who are having the same issue: https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/402148-paypal-europe-issue-with-currency-after-update-from-1609-to-11/?p=2033247 Is this a known issue that can be resolved?","Can you please provide us the log of your upgrade?

To reproduce: * In IE11 (on Win7 or Win10) go to https://jsfiddle.net/robbertbrak/84v837e9/164/ * Open the Developer console. * Switch to the Microsoft Korean IME (standard settings) and switch to Korean input. * Put the cursor in the contenteditable div and type `여름.` (on a QWERTY keyboard this is typed as `dufma.`). * Do the same for the input field. Result: in the developer console a list of composition events and the contents of the data attribute is logged. However, the data of the first `compositionend` event is wrong. It should be 여, not 여르.

This appears to be completely intermittent, with no rhyme or reason to it. For instance, I encountered it a handful of times yesterday, then it went away. Today, I've worked on my feature files all day and suddenly one of them has started to have this problem again. It's not a consistent problem. When the problem does occur, the feature.cs file in question will use NUnit attributes that no longer exist in Nunit 3: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857626-68fcbe08-ca16-11e7-89a2-d4254163b211.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857636-79a1d8ba-ca16-11e7-9a77-f4665e96c092.png) If I look at the other feature.cs files, they remain correct: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857662-9210573c-ca16-11e7-92ea-c6fd32181e1e.png) When this happens, I can get it fixed, but it's a wacky process and doesn't always work, so it often takes a few tries. I first tried cleaning & rebuilding, or deleting the feature.cs file and ""Run Custom Tool"" on the feature file to re-generate the .cs file, but once the issue arises, it will continually generate a bad .cs file for that feature file. *Steps to fix:* 1) delete the `feature.cs` file. 2) close visual studio. 3) re-open visual studio, and the project. 4) wait... eventually a window will pop up saying Specflow detected changes to your project and would like to regenerate feature.cs files, accept the prompt and the feature.cs will be generated correctly: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857870-5f0f3fd2-ca17-11e7-85bc-b629ea465855.png) This hurts my productivity because I have to shut my VS instance down and re-open it. Sometimes numerous times in a day on really bad days. I've tried to solve this on my own, thinking this could maybe be triggered by something in my solution, however I have come up empty. The NUnit package is only referenced by one project in my solution, so I don't think it's getting confused by another version hanging out somewhere or anything: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857990-dd69ab88-ca17-11e7-85ea-779b11fab770.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21978023/32857999-e3001f50-ca17-11e7-8e5c-9f3b0b21d435.png) *Btw, I absolutely adore Specflow and have been a huge proponent for it since 2012. Keep up the great work Specflow team!!* ### Steps to Reproduce Unfortunately, the issue seems hit or miss, and I can't consistently reproduce the problem. It will just happen randomly when I change and then save a Feature file. Some days It happens every time I make a change, and other days (like today) I can go all day and only see the problem once or twice. *Thanks for your time and help!*","What do you mean with ""damaged the csproj file""?

splitbrain_dokuwiki_issues_1203,"AJAX action loading and inline section edit
Let's modernize Dokuwiki! In the template I'm working on, I've overridden some of the core Doku JS to allow many actions to be fetched using AJAX instead of reloading the page. This makes Doku feel much more responsive. In particular, if you're viewing a page, you don't have to reload to switch to the edit, subscribe or revisions mode. Canceling an edit is instantaneous, and preview loads much faster as well. In addition, I've made it so that section edits happen in place -- the section you're editing gets replaced with an editor, while the rest of the page is unchanged. My code overrides existing JS, and adds an additional custom action (called ""partial""), and depends on certain class names being attached to the body tag, so it can't be patched directly into Doku, but I'd be happy to share the code, and might even have time to make the change myself.

Please check that your caps lock key is not on.""); }` The POST route that handles the actual login is like so: `//POST Login the specified user $app->post('/', 'login'); function login() { $app = Slim::getInstance(); if ( $app->request()->params('username') === '' || $app->request()->params('password') === '') { $app->flashNow('notification', 'Please fill in both fields to login.'); } else { App_User::loginUser( $app->request()->params('username'), $app->request()->params('password') ); } $app->render( 'admin/index.php', array( 'pageTitle' => 'Admin Dashboard', 'panelToDisplay' => 'admin/dashboardPanel.php', 'currentTab' => 'dashboard', 'adminView' => 'TRUE' ) ); }` Regarding the code above (all snippets) I've replace my actual application name with ""app"", but otherwise left it unchanged. I'm sure there is much about this code that could be improved, as I'm still fairly new to PHP, but at this point I'd be happy just to get this working properly. As mentioned at the beginning, I'm assuming the problem is with my code somewhere, but just on the off chance this is Slim-related I've submitted it here. Any thoughts?

Env: OSX 10.9.2 7.1 iPhone Simulator Appium v1.0.0 I ran into an issue where trying to find an element was failing on the simulator, but working just fine on device. It turns out that because my selector wasn't a key in the localizable strings file, it was failing on the simulator where it has access to the strings. (lib/devices/ios/ios-controller.js:463). Since there is no localizableStrings when being run on device, my test worked like a charm.

pallets_flask_issues_1070,"How to catch the whole request lifetime in Flask
I am writing a little extension [Flask-Profile](https://github.com/fengsp/flask-profile), nothing serious but one tiny tool to do profiling for Flask. Firstly I use one `middleware`(which is quite obvious for my purpose), middleware is working great on catching the whole thing but with one issue. I can not append the profiling result to the response which is already sent, and I really do not want to see the result using another way. Then I use the `before_request` and `after_request` hook, more issues appear, now I can modify the response to append my profiling result, though, all other extensions have to be used after `Flask-Profile` so they can be profiled. Also I am not catching the whole lifetime, I do not catch the `request_context` pushing and `session` related stuff, session is opened during the request_context pushing and is saved after `after_request` hooks were executed. Try to use the `request-started` and `request-finished` signal. Issues exist, signalling support is available only when blinker library is installed, and I still can not catch the session opening. The good news is that all extensions can be caught no matter which one calls `init_app` first. After all this, What I want is one hook that is called just after request get in and request_context is pushed(however session are not opened) and another hook that is called after `process_response`, both of which Flask does not have. I can only think of monkeying patching the `Flask.wsgi_app` which is the last thing I want to do. Any better ideas?",Can you verify that you did push this image?

bitcoin_bitcoin_issues_11356,"Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 crashes repeatedly while rebuilding local blockchain copy, no error reported
What follows is a report of unexplained crashes of the new Bitcoin Core 0.15. The available information may not be enough to identify the cause but perhaps other users can recognize identical behavior and use this ticket to acknowledge. In case the kind dev team wants to investigate the issue further, I will cooperate fully. Thanks for your time to whoever reads this. ### Describe the issue I run a Bitcoin Core node 0.14.2 node under Ubuntu 17.04. I decided to upgrade to the new 0.15 version as soon as it became possible to do so via `apt upgrade`. It is important to note that the node was fully synced and running fine before the update. It is an old piece of hardware with a brand new HDD added, and a fresh copy of the Ubuntu OS installed & configured just for the purpose of running Bitcoin Core. The first time I launched bitcoin-qt 0.15, it said a DB upgrade is necessary. Shortly afterwards it reported that the database was corrupt and the local copy of the blockchain needed to be rebuilt (I quote from memory, sadly I did not write down the exact message). The program then proceeded to process the blocks on disk. Since I am running the node on underpowered hardware (full specs below) this is a slow process: 60+ hours and counting; approx. 75% done. **During this update/resync process, the bitcoin software has crashed at least 4 times so far without any apparent error message.** debug.log contents (attached below) look normal: long sets of `UpdateTip: new best=` messages for all processed blocks interspersed with service messages like `Pre-allocating up to position xxxx in xxxx.dat` and handshakes with other nodes. ### Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Sadly, no. Crashes may happen after more than 24 hours of work or as little as 12 hours after restarting the process. The NUC is dedicated to this task only; it operates on its own and I only keep a remote shell open that runs a `tail -f debug.log` that I look at a couple of times a day. **bitcoin.conf** contents:  Besides the above configuration, I have increased the size of the database cache from the default value to 1024MB, using the bitcoin-qt settings panel. Memory usage is stable at 2GB out of 3.7GB usable, and looking for out of memory crashes using `grep ""Killed process"" /var/log/syslog` yields no results. ### What version of bitcoin-core are you using? I am using the package available from the ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin repository Version string is `v0.15.0.0-g3751912e8e` ### Machine specs: - OS: Ubuntu 17.04 (4.10.0-33-generic Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 11 10:55:28 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux) - CPU: Intel Celeron N2820 - RAM: 4GB (3.7GB available) - SWAP: 8GB - Disk size: 1.0TB (850 GB available) - Disk Type: HDD ### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. The contents of `debug.log` are provided as follows: - The startup part following a crash is attached as plaintext file. [debug.log.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/1308935/debug.log.txt) - The full log (10.8MB uncompressed) is attached as zip file.

Otherwise remove it. --> ### Environment #### Sonata packages  ## Subject If I call `$entityManager->getRepository(MyEntity::class)` in a doctrine event subscriber constructor, submitting the ""edit"" form leads to a new entity being created instead of the existing one being updated. Please see this project reproducing the issue (in a virgin sonata project) : https://github.com/pdesgarets/sonata-bug-reproducer/blob/psql/tests/EditUserTest.php https://github.com/pdesgarets/sonata-bug-reproducer/blob/psql/src/EventListener/StudentListener.php https://travis-ci.org/pdesgarets/sonata-bug-reproducer Commenting https://github.com/pdesgarets/sonata-bug-reproducer/blob/psql/src/EventListener/StudentListener.php#L24 solves the issue. The same issue occurs with MySQL instead of PostgreSQL. The issue doesn't occur using the standard symfony CRUD (generated with `bin/console make:crud`). ## Steps to reproduce Create a Sonata Project with at least one entity and one admin class attached to this entity. Add a Doctrine Event Subscriber, even without any events attached. In its constructor, inject the EntityManagerInterface and call `getRepository` of the entity you're trying to edit.

puniverse_pulsar_issues_45,"Problems with defsfn
I was running in the REPL some examples derived from this post: http://yogthos.net/posts/2015-06-17-Using-Pulsar.html Problem is, every time I redefined one of the suspendable functions (the ones created with defsfn), the -main method would hang, no matter which method was used (clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh, using CIDER commands, etc). I've looked into the definition of the defsfn macro, and found the following:  It seems that there is some kind of weird bug/interaction going on (or maybe I'm extremely unlucky :D). Anyways, here is an alternative version that seems to correct the problem:  It might be a good idea to look up the actual fn\* node instead of using zip/rightmost to make this macro more robust, but that is left as an exercise to the reader.

golang_go_issues_24171,"proposal: crypto/cipher: allow short tags in NewGCMWithNonceAndTagSize
With the new API for customizing GCM tag size, it's finally possible to reduce the GCM tag overhead for some applications. However, the new API comes with a [hard limit](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/cipher/gcm.go#L144) on the minimal tag size, 12 bytes, which is just a 4 bytes saving compare to the default value. For our use case, we use AES128-GCM to perform EtA on an IP packet flow. The data to encrypt has a bounded max size, and we call the authenticated decryption function for a limited times. As we meets the circumstances described in Appendix C of the NIST 800-38D, using an 8-byte tag would be an overkill (<1400B payload and <2^31 invocations). For the above reason, I'm proposing to relax the limit on the minimal tag size, and add a longer doc string for this function. It's understandable that a crypto library should be safe to use with it's default parameters without further mangling, but for an API designed to customize the behavior should provide more flexibility.",Did you find a workaround?

twitter_thrift_client_issues_38,"Possible bug with commands being issued multiple times
I am using active_column (https://github.com/carbonfive/active_column) to manage migrations for my cassandra database and I recently ran into problems running the migrations for an empty database. The migrations failed at random points claiming that the column family that was to be created already existed. Using debug outputs I ensured that active_column and the cassandra gem only issued the command (add_column_family) once. After some digging I ended up analyzing the network traffic (see below) and found out, that the command was sent to cassandra multiple times with the first execution succeeding but those following failing. This resulted in the described behaviour. I was using the latest versions from source for the cassandra and active_column gems and version 0.8.2 for thrift_client. Downgrading to thrift_client version 0.8.0 fixed the issue for me, so you may wanna have a look into it.

The bug is like this: When paket asks for details related to a package and you have more packages for which it needs details, it will end up mixing the reponses and also the downloads: From what I can tell there isn't a secure way to receive the callback from the nuget feed and they look to be processed randonly.

nats-io_nats-server_issues_1146,"Non-GW server cannot publish to other clusters
- [x] Feature Request or Change Proposal Hi NATS team. My first understanding of role of gateways in supercluster (after reading documuentation) was that it is a node providing connectivity to/from other clusters in the sense, that even non-GW servers from the same cluster can use it to gain extra-cluster connectivity. After setting-up a testing supercluster topology I see that actually only the clients connected to GW-enabled nodes can publish to/subscribe from other clusters. Repro: - Topology: cluster UK ( non-gw_uk_1, gw_uk_1 ), cluster US (non-gw_us_1, gw_us_1) - Client connections: - nats-sub -s non-gw_uk_1 data.> - nats-pub -s non-gw_us_1 data.xyz - My expectation: nats_sub receives a message. - Actual behavior: nats_sub does not receive a message. Is my setup correct and is this behavior expected? If so, I consider it as unfavorable from couple of reasons: A) In multi-geolocation systems consisting of interconnected DCs, the nodes responsible for **interconnection to other DCs might be within DMZs** or other firewall protection, so only these nodes can connect to other DCs. From this reason, requiring each nats-server to connect to some other-cluster counterpart is problematic. B) In the topology of the system brokers (NATS servers) might be **dedicated to connect specific kinds of clients or to be subject of some scaling decisions**. Example: ""broker concentrating frontend applications"", ""broker dedicated for single client expected to generate/receive super-high-throughputs"", ""broker placed on low-performance hardware expected to dispatch low throughputs""... However, if any broker can potentially become a random ""victim"" being forced to perform a dispatching of messages of any other brokers from other clusters then any scaling decisions or dedication of brokers is useless. It must be noted, that I understand that this is a side effect of more general trait/design decision of NATS. Other effet of it is that in the case of failure, any client can potentially be redirected to other NATS broker within the cluster (not being redirected back even after the old broker is back online). This is also unfavorable in my case, but maybe it's making sense for others. C) I'm having trouble to imagine a scenario when this behavior of ""non-GW node in supercluster unreachable to/from other clusters"" is favorable. **It seems to me that if this is ever configured, it must be always a misconfiguration**, especially considering that in case of failure any client can be automatically redirected from GW-enable to non-GW server, so the client would transparently lose its former connectivity - is this right?",Should we close this issue or do you have more questions?

ArduPilot_ardupilot_issues_7469,"ArduPlane support for Waypoint Injections in AUTO mode
#### Issue details My team and I are working on a UAV path-planning project with ArduPilot. We would like to be able to plan a mission prior to flight, and then as the aircraft sees obstacles, a path-planning algorithm would inject waypoints via a MAVLink message to modify the current mission to avoid obstacles. I see there is guided mode, but there doesn't seem to be a mode that supports prior mission planning and then in-flight mission modification. I forked this repo and made the following modifications to allow for this (I worked on ArduPlane-release, for now, since we will be using it with the Pixhawk and, for our tests, want a stable version.): The mission proceeds as planned until a MAV_CMD_INJECT_WAYPOINT is sent. When received, this command is added to the end of the current mission. ArduPilot then suspends the current active nav command and proceeds to the injected waypoint. Injected waypoints are searched for past the length of the original mission in memory. Once all injected waypoints are exhausted, ArduPilot resumes the nav command that was interrupted. It seems to work in SITL so far. My team and I plan eventually to test it with the Pixhawk. I was wondering if this might be a useful feature to integrate into ArduPilot? If, I can link modifications.

Chat webapp like Telegram is always changing its title to tell the users that there's a message. In my case, my Telegram tab is pinned. Thus, it creates an 'abstract' parent tab when I open a new link to a new tab from my Telegram tab. But when I got a message, the title of the Telegram tab is changing, and my ""abstract"" parent tab is always reloading when it happens. This is kinda annoying for me. ## Steps to reproduce 1. Start Firefox with clean profile. 2. Install TST. 3. Open Telegram or any website that its title is always changing. 4. Pin the tab. 5. Open a link in a new tab from the tab until the ""abstract"" parent tab appears. 6. When the title of the tab that you created in the step-3 is changing, you'll see that the ""abstract"" parent tab is always reloading. <!-- Please describe how to reproduce your problem on my (developer/author/other peoples') environment.

phax_as2-lib_issues_103,"Q - bcMail temporary files are created under /tmp directory and not deleted
Hi Philip, We use as2-lib, I noticed it is also using bcmail library. When a file is uploaded to the as2 server (on linux), a copy of each uploaded file is created on his “/tmp” directory. The filename pattern is “bcMail<randomChars>.mime” It has the same size of the uploaded file. The file is not deleted after the transfer is completed. For example, if you upload 200 MB file, both the destination folder and the /tmp directory will have a file with size 200 MB. The issue is that the /tmp directory is filled up with these files and user is concern about disk space. I noticed SMimeUtil is generating these temporary files (but doesn’t delete them once processed or deleteOnExit). I also read that deleteOnExit doesn't always work or can cause issues (and in any case, we need the files to be cleaned before the JVM goes down, as the server is running for a long term). We think a ""use then delete-when-finished"" approach is better than keeping this backup file forever. Might it be that you should use SMIMEUtil.toMimeBodyPart(CMSTypedStream, File) instead? IMHO, the backing file should be disposed of when it's appropriate (something like a DestroyableMimeBodyPart). Thanks, Avner","Would you post a screenshot of the response, please?

knockout_knockout_issues_1865,"Knockout binding syntax
Hello! I am going to write an gretting essay in first paragraph, skip it for tl;dr. I am using KO.js on few very large projects (250k+ php code). KO is my personal favourite when it comes to ui libraries. I've tried many of them, binders and full stack spa frameworks like angular, but in my opinion knockout wins with them to a great degree. Comparing to other frameworks, KO ""just works"", auto dependency tracking is awesome, there are not much perf bottlenecks and it can be used both with SPA and tradional apps. I would want to congratulate every developer who made this fantastic tool. The problem with KO I have is that data-bind syntax is long and unreadable on some nodes that needs many bindings. I would want to propose different syntax, instead of 1. i wuold prefer alternative 2. http://pastebin.com/RLgetMJX (yes it is angular-influenced). Here are the reasons: 1. Its a bit shorter and easier to maintain when node has a lot of bindings (we have few places where one node has 5+ different bindings). 2. IDEs and editors are highlighting attribute key-value pairs, and most of them will show ""ko-click"" part in one color and ""something"" in the other color. It REALLY increases readability of whole html sources. Looking at bindingsProvider.js I think it would not be hard to add this type of feature.

[Problematic code](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.2/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Builder.php#L489-L492):  I imagine this is more of a PHP7 problem but Laravel could, in the meantime, revert to the [previous implementation](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/v5.2.39/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Builder.php#L483-L498) of `Builder::paginate()` which doesn't have this problem in order to resolve this issue.","Why does your `perPage = 0`?

Hi, I'm trying to add a custom validation method for a date picker on a form. The date can only be a date in the future.

That said, the HabitRPG homepage looks like this for me: ![screenshot 2015-06-23 at 8 54 40 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13026274/8321328/06c55ebc-19eb-11e5-89a1-a83e9fedde9e.png) If this has already been brought up and fixed, I'm sorry. Please let me know if you need more info. Thanks! _edit by admin:_ # What to do if you experience this bug: This bug seems to be caused by extensions that block or otherwise affect Google Analytics features (e.g., adblockers, privacy tools, tracker blockers, spyware blockers, etc). We are trying to prevent this happening so that you can keep using those tools. In the meantime, please try any one of the following things (you don't need to do them all): 1. Disable all extensions. This should fix the problem immediately. You can then, if you wish, enable extensions one by one until you find the one(s) that caused the problem. 2. Use HabitRPG in incognito/privacy mode (this will only work if the relevant extension(s) have not been configured to run in incognito mode; if you have configured them to do that, turning off that setting will allow incognito mode to work). 3. Use HabitRPG on another browser that does not have the extensions installed. The extensions that might be causing the issue could be: - Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on - Avira - Privacy Badger - WebGL Inspector - Adblock - Adblock Plus - Disable Anti-Adblock - and maybe others These workaround should be only temporary! Once we work out what interaction is causing the problem, we should be able to modify HabitRPG so that you can keep using all extensions, even on HabitRPG itself. _NB: You do not need to read on below unless you are curious about the details of the investigation._",Did you have any console errors when you started the quest?

doctrine_common_issues_259,"Proxy generation discards callable type-hint
As far as I can tell, this is a limitation in PHP itself as there is no `$param->isCallable()` method defined on `ReflectionParameter`. I'm not sure if there is any way of detecting `callable`s at the moment (short of string parsing/regex), but it would be nice if the docs had a warning about it too (maybe they do and I haven't seen them).  Since `callable` is neither a class, nor an array, the generator strips it out, which leads to an `ErrorException` because the type-hint is not compatible with its parent: In the meantime, I can easily change my code to remove the type-hint and check `is_callable` myself in my method.

- Electron version: 1.2.1+ possibly 1.0+ - Operating system:Windows 10 - others? nativeImage now has possible bug. When using ""electron-canvas-to-buffer"" it was working 100% reliable in Electron 0.37.2. It is broken now in Electron 1.2.1 +, possibly in Electron 1.0 + https://github.com/mattdesl/electron-canvas-to-buffer This module is fairly simple but very convenient and makes use of Electrons built in nativeImage. Details: 1. After a few series of changing Canvas elements and saving the canvas the file is no longer saved. When the file is not written, However the file dialog is presented, and it appears that the file is saved, But it doesn't really save the file. 2. Happens saving either .jpg or .png. 3. May save OK a few times, eventually it will fail. 4. Once it fails it will not ever save canvas again until app is restarted again. 5. Tested many many canvas edits and files saves, never fails in Electron 0.37.2 Rock Solid. 6. I am using fabric.js for canvas manipulation. 7.The initial canvas save to file always works. 8.When the file save fails there is no error generated. The app does not generate an error when the write fails, But it does not generate a ""Write of',filePath,'was successful' in the console during the failure. So lack of ""success"" is the actual error indication. See the saveCallback function in ""canvastest.js"" in the zip files or as below. ""throw err"" doesn't present itself when the file doesn't write. function saveTheFile(){ dialog.showSaveDialog({title:'Testing a save dialog',defaultPath:'image.png'},saveCallback); } function saveCallback(filePath){ // as a buffer var buffer = canvasBuffer(canvas, 'image/png') // write canvas to file fs.writeFile(filePath, buffer, function (err) { //throw err if(err)throw err;else console.log('Write of',filePath,'was successful'); }) 9.Using Windows 10 x64, Windows 32 bit version of Electron You can test good (made on Electron 0.37.2) vs. bad (made on Electron 1.2.1) app. Zip files are too big to attach here. I have it on my website. Just load a photo on the canvas and save. Both apps are the same code, just made minor changes to allow the new version 1.2.1 Electron to work, for example removing ""dashes"" in require statements, as you had to do in electron-canvas-to-buffer V 2.0. Apps can be launched just click ""Electron.exe"" in root of the zip file.

pandas-dev_pandas_issues_6898,"ENH: Aggregate to data with error range
As mentioned in issue #6897, working with data with error ranges is pretty much universal in science, as well as many other fields. There are python packages, like `uncertainties`, for working with this sort of data. However, pandas has no built-in tools for creating or working with data with error ranges, leaving users to create their own columns or a separate pandas object to hold error ranges (see, e.g. #5638) or manually creating and using `uncertainties` objects. I think it would be very helpful if there was an aggregate method that would aggregate data to data with an error range (such as an `uncertanties` array). By default, it could use `mean` to get the center values and and `sem` (standard error of the mean) or `std` to get the error ranges, but it would probably be good for users to be able to specify their own functions for calculating the center values and/or the error ranges.",How'd you install pandas?,Could you explain why this is an issue?,What version of matplotlib and what backend are you using?,can u show a sample use case and implementation (even if slow)?,does it happen on every dataset for you ?,What version of pandas are you using?

obiba_opal_issues_3296,"Values truncated using SPSS Import
When importing using SPSS, numeric values are truncated based on the precision of the Decimal variable setting in the SPSS file. The Decimal setting is a display setting and often the value stored has a larger number of decimal places. this means that Opal is losing the additional decimal places. Is the IBM SPSS API used to do the standard SPSS import, is there an alternative setting that could be used to import the full value rather than the display value? If not one option would be to change all numeric variables to format F40.16 (the maximum) before importing, however it would be useful to retain the original format for the opal attributes e.g ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34068523/45163036-4354e900-b1e7-11e8-8ed2-1d8865429c13.png) To recreate import the following CSV structure into SPSS and saved as a .sav file  Set the variable details as below ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34068523/45163072-5b2c6d00-b1e7-11e8-8fd4-9d043fc4061f.png) When importing using SPSS, the data will be imported like ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34068523/45163099-6b444c80-b1e7-11e8-95c1-c26c57e1e43a.png) When importing using SPSS (R), the full value is imported and there is no loss of precision.

rails_rails_issues_4633,"date_select with both discard_day and include_blank may be broken in 3.2
I have a regression between Rails 3.1 and 3.2 that appears to be introduced by pull request #2086. I have a form with a date_select like this:  In Rails 3.1 that worked fine as the multi-parameter conversion in ActiveRecord automatically added a 1 (one) for each missing parameter. However, Rails 3.2 (with pull request #2086) changed this behaviour to return nil if any of the multi-parameters were missing. That effectively means that it is no longer possible to use the above combination. The date_select will provide a default day-value in a hidden field only if include_blank is false. A possible solution may be to change this behaviour to always add hidden fields with default values regardless of the include_blank parameter as it would simply be discarded now.",Could you create a reproduction script with this template https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_gem.rb?,Could you create a reproduction script with this template https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.rb?,Can you please confirm that everything is working now?

I'm fairly new to yar and hapi, but let me do my best to explain what I'm trying to accomplish: - My Hapi server is making calls to another API service, and I use keepAlive agent on these calls, but the challenge we are facing now is every once in a while the service closes the connection and responds with ECONNRESET error. - So our 'band-aid' solution for now is to detect these ECONNRESET errors, redirect to homepage, and show a simple alert. - What I was hoping to do is to (a) detect the ECONNRESET response on the onPreResponse lifecycle, (b) set an alert message in session, and (c) change the response to a redirect to homepage. Here's the snippet:  - Then, I was going to retrieve the alert message from session in one of my homepage route pre-handlers, and save the alert into an app state object that gets sent to the front-end to display the alert.  But for some reason, the alerts in session did not persist from onPreResponse to the homepage pre-handler, i.e., request.yar.get('alerts') === null in the pre-handler. Is there something about onPreResponse lifecycle that doesn't allow me to save data into session? Any help is greatly appreciated. Below are my yar options. I tried to distill the code snippets to just the relevant parts, but let me know if I can provide any further info that might help.

Automattic_mongoose_issues_5801,"Feature Request: support ""populate as"" for compatibility with GraphQL
<!-- *Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of mongoose --> **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?** Feature **What is the current behavior?** Populate feature can only populate the field containing the ObjectID itself, effectively masking the original ObjectID field e.g. For an Order Model that contains a userId field like so: userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' } If I do something like Order.find({}).populate('user') then the userId field will substitute the entire User Object for the userId. This creates a problem for Graphql and other solutions that put another data access layer in front of mongoose, since userId is no longer an ObjectId on read operations, although it is in fact an ObjectId. **Since GraphQL relies on strict type definitions, the mongoose populate feature is effectively unusable with GraphQL, at least not without some cumbersome workarounds.** **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.** <!-- If you can, provide a standalone script / gist to reproduce your issue --> n/a **What is the expected behavior?** I would contend that morphing the object type for the field 'userId' in this example is bad design necessitated by current limitations in mongoose, and that the best way forward would be to allow a ""populate AS"" feature that allows an alternate materialized field to be populated. e.g. a schema definition as follows could indicate that a second 'user' field should contain the populated field based off userId. userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', populateAs: 'user' } **Please mention your node.js, mongoose and MongoDB version.** latest as of Nov 2017",How do you define your model?,when you save users are you saving them with devices?,can you post a code sample / pseudo code to illustrate exactly how this would look?

If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior. --> Currently when rendering multiple apps to the client, react generates prop warnings as a result of the use of material-ui components. if the material ui components are removed, OR if I just render one app with material ui components, it works fine. ![material-ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33596237/41050301-dc7ebc4e-69aa-11e8-96df-856212ecba59.gif) The warning specifically is :  ## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs) <!--- Provide a link to a live example (you can use codesandbox.io) and an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug.

I can put together a github repo if need be. On the client side there is the following code for dealing with react/material-ui:  If I were to comment out either the renderPieApp or renderChartApp calls, the issue would go away. These are the react apps that are being produced between client and server:   Initially I had the componentDidMount calls of both apps in a shared higher order component, though for the purposes of keeping this example to as few snippets as possible I've put them into each app. In either case the issue would still the same. Note that the ssrID is just a style id used to get the correct style tag to remove and can be one of the following for this example case: 1. tracks - ""jss-server-side-tracks"", 2. mode - ""jss-server-side-mode"" On the server side the relevant code is the following: Firstly here is the code that handles server side rendering of react apps:  And lastly, this is the <Sytles /> app component that is used on the server for rendering:  After the server side rendering of the apps is done it is sent to the client like so:  Notice that I use separate style tags for each of the rendered apps css. I have also tried just dumping all styles into one tag like your docs example - ""jss-server-side"" - but that didn't work either. I thought that this might be a misconfiguration problem, so I've tried the following combinations: 1. creating a single sheets registry that stores all css, followed by a single style tag at the html code which would contain all of the styling for all apps. 2. creating a single theme instance before all app are rendered, as opposed to creating new mui themes for each app that is rendered. This means that the renderApp function above on the server would be like this:  ## Context <!--- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world. --> The project I'm working on is using multiple apps, so ideally I'd want to just SSR all of them. Whether this is a bug or a misconfiguration issue, I don't know. Either way, I'm out of ideas. This however also raises a related issue for this post: the documentation. Particularly with the [server side rendering guide](https://material-ui.com/guides/server-rendering/), I've found it to be quite frustratingly vague and conflicting in places. Take your troubleshooting guide as an example: This reads to me like you need to use class name generator on the client as well, however none of your examples use it and it is only ever used in the doc example on the server? I'm assuming this is what it's meaning ----> 'The whole page needs to be rendered **first on the server with one generator, then on the client**'? Furthermore, from what I can see (happy to be corrected here!), it doesn't look like any of your code examples cover rendering with multiple apps. I think that it would be worth adding some additional information to your doc that clarifies any changes/additional steps required, as between searching for solutions on stack overflow, in your issues page and re-reading your docs, I've been stumped with this issue for hours. ## Your Environment <!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment with which you experienced the bug. --> The project uses express for the server in conjunction with webpack for hot reloading. | Tech | Version | |--------------|---------| | Material-UI | v1.2.0 | | React | v16.3.2 | | browser | chrome |",What's your use case?,How do you reproduce it?,Do you have a reproduction?,Do you have a live reproduction?,What does https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd say about the transform problem?,Did you know if you have installed the material types? npm uninstall @types/material-ui work for me!,Does that change solve your problem?  https://codesandbox.io/s/kmqoo1ypkr,What's the issue in more detail?,Could you supply a picture of the problem?,"Why would you want to have two mounting points?

antirez_redis_issues_2407,"Redis Cluster: `setslots` between random nodes causes configuration mismatch
I've written a script to rebalance slots across a cluster, similar to `redis-trib reshard`. The primary difference with the script I'm using is that it chooses the node with the lowest number of slots allocated to it and moves a slot from the node with the highest number of slots. This means that the nodes we're moving slots from and to changes continuously, like so  I've copied the main slot moving logic from `reshard`, so there shouldn't be any issues with the commands being issued/core logic. Running this script WITHOUT any of the node ordering (as in, doing the re-allocation in batches of old-node->new-node, like in `redis-trib reshard`) works perfectly at any speed, but when different nodes are being queries it often results in the cluster being left in a state like so (and unfixable): ![screen shot 2015-02-18 at 17 48 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1441031/6253027/645588c0-b796-11e4-98f0-10a1ac5e63f3.png) I suspect that the internal Redis Cluster gossip has some conflict issues when there are lots of slot re-allocations happening across multiple nodes at the same time. The number of slots left unallocated/conflicting is drastically reduced if there's a timeout after each slot is moved (500ms worked okay, 100ms left ~5 slots, 250ms left 1 slot).

golang_go_issues_11269,"net/http: http.ServeFile and http.ServeContent Explicitly Set http.StatusOK
**What version of Go are you using (go version)?** go version go1.4.2 darwin/amd64 **What operating system and processor architecture are you using?** OS X 10.10.3 x86-64 **What did you do?** Set w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) prior to calling http.ServeFile **What did you expect to see?** A HTTP 500 status. **What did you see instead?** A HTTP 200 status (and the usual multiple header writes error for messing it up). Currently http.ServeFile (which calls http.ServeContent and then eventually http.serveContent) implicitly sets the status code to HTTP 200 as per [this line in src/http/fs.go](http://golang.org/src/net/http/fs.go#L254) From what I can see, removing this line would result in net/http implicitly calling w.WriteHeader(StatusOK) as per usual (http://golang.org/src/net/http/server.go#L990) - which is the behaviour I'd expected until running into this. **Proposed Fix** - Modify http.serveContent to only call w.WriteHeader(code) on an error condition. Set var code int (i.e. zero value) instead of defaulting to code := StatusOK. - If code still has the zero value before we write to the ResponseWriter, then don't call WriteHeader. - This allows the server to either: a) write the header set by the package user or; b) write the implicit http.StatusOK if no header has been set by the time we're ready to write back.

https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/464 and https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/482 are proposals to change Fetch's behavior to block a few non-standard ports. We don't have test servers running on these ports, which means that for most things, the failure case (network error because of a timeout) will be the same as the success case (network error due to blockage) in terms of its web-visible side-effects.

sequelize_sequelize_issues_11208,"Association with Other Not Null Values
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** Well i hope i haven't found after my 6 hours research the solution on the internet. The main Problem i got is some 3 Table Join. Lets just take this simple scenario: Meal, User, Canteen. each of these got an id which of cause is unique. I would like to make it possible to get a table: ""MealComments"". Since in my Scenario it would be great if there could be a primaryKey `(meal,user,canteen)` but I'm already dealing, that this isn't possible. Well this table MealComments should have an other key ""commentText"", which is a String. Since comments wihtout content are not usefull a ""Not Null"" is pretty obvious. This is my MealComments Model: `queryInterface.createTable('MealRatings', { id: { allowNull: false, autoIncrement: true, primaryKey: true, type: Sequelize.INTEGER }, value: { type: Sequelize.FLOAT, allowNull: false }, mealId: { type:Sequelize.INTEGER, references: { model: ""Meals"", key: ""id"", }, onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: ""CASCADE"", }, canteenId: { type:Sequelize.INTEGER, references: { model: ""Canteens"", key: ""id"", }, onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: ""CASCADE"", }, userId: { type:Sequelize.INTEGER, references: { model: ""Users"", key: ""id"", }, onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: ""CASCADE"", }, createdAt: { allowNull: false, type: Sequelize.DATE }, updatedAt: { allowNull: false, type: Sequelize.DATE } });` **Describe the solution you'd like** A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Let's assume I got an Instance of Meal(fries), Canteen(burgerKing),User(me) What would be great would be this: `let mealComment = new models.MealComment({commentText: ""Nice Fries""}); await mealComment.setUser(me,{save: false}); await mealComment.setMeal(fries,{safe:false}); await mealComment.setCanteen(burgerKing,{safe:false}); await mealComment.save();` The MealComments model looks like this: `'use strict'; module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => { const MealComment = sequelize.define('MealComment', { commentText: DataTypes.STRING }, {}); MealComment.associate = function(models) { // associations can be defined here MealComment.belongsTo(models.Meal, { onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: 'CASCADE' }); MealComment.belongsTo(models.Canteen, { onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: 'CASCADE' }); MealComment.belongsTo(models.User, { onUpdate: ""CASCADE"", onDelete: 'CASCADE' }); }; return MealComment; };` The Problem is, that as soon as I try to assign a User,Meal,Canteen it throws me an error, that commentText does not have a value. As User,Meal,Canteen should be additional Not Null, but I'm dealing that this isn't possible also. I hope either I'm stupid as fuck and couldn't figure this out, or that someone got a nice solution for my pitty problem. Worst case would be ... if this would be a feature request. **Why should this be in Sequelize** It would be very nice, to assign Associations and Values at once. **Describe alternatives you've considered** - I thout about using only Integers and managing the whole setting on my own, but that was one of the reasons I started using Sequelize. - I also tried turning off the NotNull enforcment, but well I need it. - I thought about abstracting Comment-User to UserComment, with an ID, which then would'nt be a problem at all. but It's pretty ugly having an extra table for that. - I thought about using other ORM's for Node (TypeOrm, Prisma, ...) but, they don't support much as Sequelize. **Usage example** `let mealComment = new models.MealComment({commentText: ""Nice Fries""}); await mealComment.setUser(me,{save: false}); await mealComment.setMeal(fries,{safe:false}); await mealComment.setCanteen(burgerKing,{safe:false}); await mealComment.save();` **Additional context** Thanks for reading this",Can you provide a link to a test project on GitHub?

SheetJS_sheetjs_issues_1579,"readFile get wrong formula (columns offset)
Hi, I have a strange behavior when reading an excel file. When I open the file and save it with my version of Excel, the file is properly read with xlsx. However, when I do not touch it and read it with xlsx, some formulas are offseted. Here is an example: I read my excel file and focus on cell O124. Before opening it and saving it (without doing any modification), here is what I get in cell O124: `{ t: 'n', v: 18202.970297029704, f: 'O124*(1+P144)*(1+P$146)', w: '18,203',` Of course, there is here a circular reference (on O124). The P144 and P146 are also shifted. However, when I open it and save it with Excel (I am using Excel 2019), I can see the formula is N124 and not O124 (so no circular reference). Here is he result: `{ t: 'n', v: 18202.970297029704, f: 'N124*(1+O144)*(1+O$146)', w: '18,203',` I have correctly the N124, O144 and O146.

I was working in a modules-based project, and reviewing an existing file, pkg/api/public.go. I created a new test file in the same package, contracts_test.go. I opened the file and wrote  And saved the file. At some point between creating the new file and saving it, the public.go file I had been reading became full of red squiggles, each under a variety of identifiers for things defined in the same package, but another file, util.go: things like ErrFoo, or unexportedFunctions. Each of the errors suggested the identifier was not defined. I ran gopls ... check on public.go at this point and got the following complete output: [gist](https://gist.github.com/peterbourgon/12424cd98ce798122b62ae626c6936c8). I opened the util.go file in the same package and confirmed the identifiers existed. When I went back to public.go, the red squiggles under the identifiers declared in the util.go file were gone, and now the only red squiggle was under an identifier for a type in another package, with the same error. Command-clicking on the identifier, however, brought me to the proper declaration in the other package. Confused, I clicked back into public.go, and discovered: (a) the red squiggle under the identifier I had just clicked on was gone; (b) several other files in the same package which were not previously red (errored) had become red; and (c) there were several brand new red squiggles under all sorts of identifiers in public.go that had no common theme. For example, some code:  had a red squiggle under r, the right hand side of the assignment, claiming ""cannot use r (variable of type *mux.Router) as http.Handler value in assignment: wrong type for method ServeHTTP."" At this point I ran gopls ... check on public.go again and got the following complete output: [gist](https://gist.github.com/peterbourgon/3bd0ea1d5dbb38f0a696e33ecd767b3c). (I think it is identical to before.) I then captured the following output from gopls debug log in VS Code: [gist](https://gist.github.com/peterbourgon/5a8eac80e44690b4d46460b3ed71923a).

eslint_eslint_issues_5553,"New Rule Option Proposal for space-infix-ops
**When does this rule option warn? Please describe and show example code:** Currently if you set space-infix-ops=1 code like the following is flagged:  Therefore, I would propose adding a new option (just like the existing `int32Hint` option), named something to the effect of `ignore-default-parameters`. When set to `false` it would apply the `space-infix-ops` rule normally, except for `=` characters used to define a default parameter. **Is this rule option preventing an error or is it stylistic?** Stylistic **Why is this rule option a candidate for inclusion instead of creating a custom rule?** ES6 is being adopted by more and more developers, and I doubt I'm the only one who would like to have a space-less `=` when defining default parameters. This is especially true because other programming languages already have this functionality (eg. Python), and the standard formatting in those languages is often space-less (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8853063/pep-8-why-no-spaces-around-in-keyword-argument-or-a-default-parameter-value). Therefore, I believe it belongs as part of the core rule set. **Are you willing to create the rule yourself?** This seems like something that would be very easy to someone familiar with the codebase to implement, but would require a great deal of learning for someone not familiar with it (ie. me).

##### Description of the problem A small web game utilizing three.js crashed when I updated the three.min.js that the client uses. In a render function, the client calls: `var pLocal = new THREE.Vector3(x, 0, z); //in front of camera` `var pWorld = pLocal.applyMatrix4(camera.matrixWorld);` where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers from keyboard events. `console.log(pLocal);` returns a vector, typically: `q {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}` but `console.log(pWorld)` returns: `{x: NaN, y: NaN, z: NaN}` When I switch the three.min.js back to a version from long ago, `console.log(pWorld)` returns: `q {x: 0, y: 5, z: 0}` `console.log(camera.matrixWorld)` returns a matrix with all elements defined. switching back to the current three.js version, `console.log(camera.matrixWorld)` returns a matrix whose last four elements are `NaN`.

Cause the C program to SEGSIGV by dereference a NULL pointer src file: [infinitesignalloop.gz](https://github.com/golang/go/files/3298547/infinitesignalloop.gz) to compile: uncompress src file to GOPATH and run make to reproduce: just run ./trap_signal before <!-- If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.

The program should crash finally with the default system segfault handler be called.  ### What did you see instead? A infinite sighandling loop has happen.  Following the code with gdb, it seems that Go signal handler raises SIGSEGV again to invoke the C handler, then C handler reraise SIGSEGV, which is catched by Go signal handler again, and then repeat and repeat.

Hi Erich, I used the FATFS and a CDC in a Kinetis-Design-Studio project (Freescale-NXP-Qualcomm :-) K60) with IAR EWARM compiler.
